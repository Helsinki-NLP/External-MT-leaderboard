Welsh MPs worry they'll be mistaken for Muppets
Some MPs have expressed concern about the proposed change of their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern has arisen in relation to plans to change the name of the assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that it would "be synonymous with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "smooth" and the word "pwp" means "scratches".
One Plaid MP said the faction as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his own party was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill to adopt the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which the MPs will be called will naturally be a matter for the MPs themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of Members of Parliament, the Commission has favoured the term 'Member of the Welsh Parliament' or WMP, but the choice of MWP has been the one that has received the most support in the public consultation.
MEPs are obviously proposing alternatives, but trying to reach consensus may be a difficult matter for the Speaker of Parliament, Ellen Jones, who is expected to table the bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way parliament works, including rules on dismissal of MPs and the design of the committee system.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment, which is to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
The citizens of Macedonia are voting for the referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbour conceals territorial overtones and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Georgy Ivanov, President of the FYROM, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that change is merely the price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's have been silenced as the churches of Harlem disappear
"The older people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither".
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood 'living room' where people frequent regularly".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as those responsible hope "and sooner or later they will return to the point where they started".
Churches, he added, may be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who will not be willing to help the remaining places of worship in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when all these churches will close down completely, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move into these apartments will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation broke away in the 1930's.
A black congregation located a short distance away took over the building.
The occupation of St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the shops on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners took over the rebuilding and commissioned the quarry.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July described it somewhat differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany Inn of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What's been going on in the last few months at St. Martin's is a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the lay leaders of the church, while others were hired by the diocese.
The commissioners - the parish governing body, made up of lay leaders - sent the diocese a letter in July concerning their concerns that the diocese "would seek to pass the cost" on to the commissioners, despite the fact that this had no bearing on the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark attack on 13-year-old at lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday during a California lobster fishing dive, on the first day of lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child's cries for help and rowed with a team to get it out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just excited cries because he caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His whole clavicle was open", observed Hamel when he reached the boy's place.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" added Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Rescue officer Larry Giles told the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was not considered to belong to any endangered species.
Giles added that the victim has severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Bece in Casablanca to Suamis in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by setting up a cosmetics store with specialist staff.
As part of the UK's £2.8 billion cosmetics market's significant upswing, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household goods are declining, the largest cosmetics shelves will be installed in 11 stores nationwide in trials and spread to more stores if the project is successful.
The investment in cosmetics comes as supermarkets look to replace the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also be given more space with company logo shelves, similar to those of stores like Boots.
The supermarket is re-launching its own boutique makeup line so that most products are vegan - something that younger consumers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to market its products in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
E-shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food every day in local mini-markets means that supermarkets will have to make greater efforts to get people to visit them.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will increasingly resemble department stores, as supermarket chains try to compete with Aldi and Lidl's discount stores with more non-food services.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, while also introducing some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which boosted grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how profits from the chain's pharmacy stores were to be distributed to the chain's supermarkets.
The new strategy was devised after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It said Lloyds would play its own role in the scheme, adding a broader range of luxury grocery companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of companies is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a viable destination for cosmetics that challenges the traditional way of shopping.'
Peter Jones: furious after Holly Willoughby walks away from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m deal with her lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business has been likened to the Goop company of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones mad by quitting their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her huge new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - she would no longer have enough time to devote to clothing and accessories company Truly.
The company has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and appears to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his country homes.
According to one source: "Truly was far from Holly Willoughby's top priorities.
It was about her long-term future, her source of income for decades to come.
Her decision to resign surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlow ready to be put up for sale".
Experts estimate that the departure of the "This Morning" host, who is among Britain's most commercially successful celebrities, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home furnishings, as well as further delay in her presentation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained a close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones retains a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the face of M&S's campaigns and replace Ed McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We would not like to comment on his business affairs".
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for a comment that some would consider inappropriate for a president, as well as his so positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said imitating the tone of a TV presenter.
"I have not conceded anything".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Rai Yong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "corresponding response" from the United States following the early disarmament of North Korea.
The EU has also been involved in the negotiations with the United States, which is the largest trading partner of the European Union.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have built this wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have borne positive fruits - ending missile tests, freeing hostages and returning the remaining American troops to their homes.
While he supported his unusual stance in statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'presidential' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands dead in their wake
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was announced that foreign NGOs would not be needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary condition for the international aid to be used.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite difficult", said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palouse, it is not yet certain whether the foreign staff will be able to work there.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute aid.
Given the frequent earthquakes that afflict Indonesia, the country remains pathetically unprepared for the fury of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, the same is not true on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palo, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is difficult.
Natural disasters further complicate administrative care.
A floating hospital that had been stationed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is on its way to Palouse, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused his campaign on improving Indonesia's disorganized infrastructure and lavished money on building roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding is plaguing Mr. Joko's administration before his re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from lingering fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is tied against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge took a pass from Serdán Sakiri about 27 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and bounced to the back of the net.
His effort was driven very high from the big area and ended up right up in the nets.
The ball finally landed on Cape Arizaballaga who jumped to repel it and hit the net.
"I was trying to get this position, to get to the ball and players like Sakiri always play as much forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I made a direct switch, I didn't think much about it and I shot".
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 at half-time after a 25th-minute goal by Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue forward passed the heel to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before he shot a falcon near the center of the field and ran to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar into the big area.
Azar ran ahead of the defender and finished by sending the ball into the back of the net with a left-handed shot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videotron in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The tragic death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia stands at 832, according to statements from the country's natural disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the area on Friday and created waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sotopo Puruo Ngoroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect after killing a woman with a knife
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of the body of a woman in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked the neighbors who saw or heard something to report it to the police .
Police Officer Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity around John Street who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who think they may know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police said they are in the process of informing next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews, attempting to return to his apartment, was informed by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it may be hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene right now.
A woman appeared on stage in tears.
He kept saying, "It's horrible".
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the police tape and one outside.
Cops were standing outside the curb and watching the apartment building.
Anyone with any information please send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers hotline anonymously on 0800 555 111 for the 247 case of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument to be affected by the "rewrite history" controversy.
His ostracization would be poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of England's numerous cultural and religious works by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr Crick's proposal "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "In the present discussion of the removal of statues, it was inevitable not to target the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The iconoclasm of England's civil wars was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Possibly the wrong member of the Cromwell family to be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The exceptional portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is a hallmark of his image in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe deserves tribute.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this is an absolutely accurate case is a matter of open historical debate.
All that is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable".
Pig-killer fatally wounds Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose surname was only "Uan", was found with an artery cut in a pool of blood near a pigsty in the market of Liupanshue in Guizhou province, southern China, the Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farm worker prepares to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door to a neighboring pigsty open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The coroner's examination confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 kilograms, had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", said the cousin, known by the nickname "Wu", according to the evening news of Gujiang.
Security camera footage shows Wang entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Wang or his cousin.
A market official told the evening news that the pig has been put in a cage to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police have gathered evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wang's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer's wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "stain".
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're little, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them the proper respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are about to bring extensive rainfall to the southwestern United States .
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring catastrophic flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa's winds reached 85 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday and was spotted 385 miles southwest of Punta Eujenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area of wind has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward to the U.S. West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture northward to the Southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to eight inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching low-pressure area will create extensive heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour in places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters is expected in places in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapidly worsening phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended to avoid any walking in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers and storms will cause local high winds and sandfall.
The low-pressure wind zone will create some locally heavy rainfall over parts of the Southern California coastline.
Overall rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is likely, which can cause small flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some sporadic tropical storms will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before slowly expanding late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, some sharp temperature changes will be observed across the U.S. as temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in the tropics remain fairly high.
Sometimes this leads to very sharp temperature changes at close distances.
A typical example of the sharp temperature differences between the central United States was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., October is expected to start with high temperatures of 27 °C from the Eastern Plains to parts of the Southeast.
The temperature in New York City can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched the Brett Kavanaugh audition
More than 20 million viewers watched the compelling testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blazy Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with television networks interrupting the regular stream of the program for Friday's last-minute overturn: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that at a party while they were high school students, Kavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a loaded statement, said he was 100 percent sure that none of this happened.
According to Nielsen measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers watched the Friday hearing.
The company calculated average television viewership on the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While Nielsen also usually has difficulty calculating the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office space.
To see this TV in the right dimensions, it's an audience the size of a football game or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, averaged 5.69 million viewers during the day's broadcast, according to Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
They were followed by CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was cast in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican announced he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters Friday morning disapproval of him as he tried to get into the elevator for a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes low for several minutes as they disapproved of him, live on television on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth in this country?
She said, "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at the Commission hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were live-streaming a few hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote on advancing Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate floor for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was convinced in part after discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After discussions with Koons and several other senators afterwards, Flake came out.
Flake's choice was valid, because it was obvious that Republicans would not gather the votes to pass Cavanaugh without conducting a survey.
President Trump has requested an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party convention in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside her own on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is a sharp critic of the Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect tariffs was "totally absurd".
Police have arrested suspect Dayton Simpson for the murder of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and is being held in custody on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police located the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found traces of Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, which works with CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to fatally wounding Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report from the East Baton Rouge coroner released Friday, cause of death is gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The Department has made available to the Louisiana State Police a task force, the police crime lab, the Southern University police force and local citizens to assist in the search for the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joey Aleva thanked local law enforcement for the "proven investigation and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-9 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "devastated" and "in a state of shock" over Wade's death.
"We're always worried about incidents like this", said Oweid.
Emissions of volcanic ash in Mexico City
Emissions of volcanic ash from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, as activity at the crater reached its peak, with 183 emissions of gas and ash recorded in a 24-hour period.
The Centre was monitoring various signs and minor seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show car windshields covered in thin layers of ash in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash between pro-independence protesters and law enforcement units as thousands took part in demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarized vote for Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked pro-independence protesters, held back by the restored order units, threw eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the roads that are usually flooded by tourists.
Clashes also occurred later in the day with police using their clubs to suppress the clashes.
For hours, groups of supporters of Catalonian independence chanted "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of pro-unity protesters who shouted "Viva España".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, which is nevertheless celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although turnout was low with those opposed to independence boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police authorities tried to disrupt voting at polling stations in the area where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped late Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different turn.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the independence demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our greatest moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant", he said.
Despite scoring a vital but limited victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders having self-exiled or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Poots, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded pro-police protests on his cell phone, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The tension is escalating", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained last year, announced his candidacy for next year's European elections.
"My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the repression we have received from the Spanish Government", he said.
London: Man arrested after car crashed into home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car in a residence in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Bollinagar Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a drive-by shooting at some point.
Menga 's shot gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers .
Dolly Menga 's first goal for Livingston secured the win .
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard just his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Iberrocks.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team remains unbeaten away from home in the championship this season and faces the Hearts, who have an eight-point lead, next Sunday.
Before this game, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile continues its undefeated run in six games in its division, with head coach Holt yet to taste a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing chances to the visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, with his quickness putting the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and almost reached the finish line, but Alan Lithgow thwarted his attempt by slipping Craig Halkett's head away from the finish line.
The pitchers willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could squeeze the visitors on free throws and corners.
And that's how the big goal came.
The Rangers were unable to prevent a free-kick and Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to send the ball to Menga, who took the pass and scored from the center of the area.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated possession but found the defense of the pitchers impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced no difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos kicked the ball away from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was repulsed by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's feet and Lithgow's pass was out on another Livingston free kick.
There were many vertical passes in the Livingston area and they were repeatedly repelled, while two penalties were called - after Halkett claimed the ball against substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
This is Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macarooni Arena.
Spectacular performances and results for Livingston.
All of them, without exception, were exceptional, exceeding expectations on this climb.
Their playing style and personality have changed little since their return to top form, but credit should also be given to Holt for the boost he gave the team upon his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, recruiting a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Worrell on alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, were not inspired.
As good as they've been in the past under Gerard's guidance, they didn't meet those standards.
Their last game was a poor one - they only managed to get past the defense once and that's a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Mixed emotions at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The atmosphere was good on Saturday (September 29) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had split on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police ruled out the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get close to see their president up close.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them of Kurdish origin - also showed up, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The split of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor who is viewed by some German Turks as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Detford: cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and abandoned a cyclist, who died on Childers Street, about a mile (1.6 km) from the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said authorities are making efforts to identify the man and notify their next of kin.
Roads have been closed and bus routes diverted, and drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lardin Prison: Six police officers injured in clashes
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out at the maximum security men's prisons, according to statements from the Prison Directorate.
Riots broke out at Her Majesty's Long Lathin Prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special Tornado police forces have been deployed to deal with the riots, involving eight detainees, which took place in a ward.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries during the clashes.
A prison spokesman said: "Special trained personnel have taken over the incident at Her Majesty's Long Ladin Prison.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may serve a longer sentence".
His Majesty's Long Ladin Prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the prison's law enforcement units were called in to suppress serious incidents that broke out during which staff members were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross southwestern parts of the desert, bringing flooding in their path.
The National Weather Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass just over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday in rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest models from the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated rainfall of up to 6 inches in the Mongol Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to experience rainfall of 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of individual total rainfall of up to 4 inches.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rain that Rosa brings can be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern States are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought", weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining hurricane intensity, by Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
It is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm intensity on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, possibly as high as 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main threat from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern U.S. states", said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flooding and mudslides in the deserts and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following the identification of a 16-year-old who was stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Beast area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are urging anyone who may have videoed what happened on their cell phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "lived the anger and the wrath" of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "lived the wrath and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his run for the presidency.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, flatly and with obvious emotion denying Christine Blaisey Ford's claims that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before a jury about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's candidacy while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am", he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting outstanding candidates".
Trump has mentioned that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first major Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by the giant waves that swept the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet [20 m] hit the shore at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was made yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so they were hit by it", Sotopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster management agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it swept cars, timber, houses, hit everything on land", said Nogrocho, adding that the tsunami had traveled through the ocean at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palouse.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster response agency show many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The quakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nogroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
He reported that heaps of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Ngroho said casualties and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Palo, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications systems "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and it could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palo, even though officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is heard on the top floor of a building screaming panic trying to warn people down the road about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away homes and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also disrupted communications in the wider Palouse area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced are still in desperate need of food and other basic essentials.
The city's airport has reopened only to assist with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala managed to reach Palou City safely, where the workers found shelter in mossad shelters set up in their office yard, they passed disaster scenes on the way, Dosheba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have taken on the sad task of starting the relief process for the injured, some complain that foreigners, especially experienced relief workers, are not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin if the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Auliya Aryani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can make a request for international assistance, but there's no decision yet".
As the second day in Palo after Friday's earthquake and tsunami passes, friends and family of those still missing are still hoping that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the story of these natural disasters less bleak.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to her mother's dead body.
Gendhon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national ski team, had trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madaiji, were his students.
"As a veteran of the sport of skydiving, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Genton recounted how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread to the skydiving community, he began sending desperate WhatsApp messages to his opponents in Palo who were attending the beach festival.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray "n" instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves made off with $26,750 while refueling an automatic pickup machine in Newport on the Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves seized $26,750 from a Brink employee who was servicing an ATM machine in Newport on the Levy, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after the Brink's clerk" and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, according to the statement, but police did not identify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police by calling 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long listened to the fondly called Ye and used that moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator stated.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has stated in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning 'you,'" West said earlier this year in a discussion about the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, we are us.
My name changes from Kanye, meaning "the one", to Ye, who is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the messy self, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but he announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, ZE-ZI, is also content with using his name with or without capital letters.
The president-elect of Mexico swears he will not use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody student crackdown.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, says AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes on top of announcements by various parts of the US government on artificial intelligence, as the US does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year to become the world's leading country in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are aiming to make the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top American player Othello, while later serving as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee recognized the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would be held, in order to identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the best of the academic world, it's the corporations", he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university officials to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to holders of a PhD in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Council of China issued a Next Generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies respectively distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is inferior, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which will include partners from the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation now invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in months in U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
The citizens of Macedonia hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would rename itself the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would end a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist rivals argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether turnout will reach the required 50 percent for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece'.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organizations like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because then our lives will be safer", said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament have stated that they will comply with the outcome of the vote to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required for a name change.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout reached just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when it gave the present 66 percent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in the referendum on changing the country's name to pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union in the city of Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and places chairs in front of the stands set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as second-class partners", Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring coveted investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He mentioned that a positive outcome would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, the turnout in the referendum would be between 30 and 43 percent, which is below the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
The referendum must be successful if the turnout is to reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero goes through the whole of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling formed Brighton's defence by winning 2-0 to Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed an easy shot in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward took a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the stage.
He passed three Brighton defenders before he blew into the open.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green players.
He dribbled past one defender, then eluded several others on the edge of the greater Brighton area.
Then he passed to his left, finding Sterling.
The English forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the nets.
"Aguero is having some problems with his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment".
However, it was Stirling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area at this point.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sane held the ball in his possession and guided Sterling to the back of the net.
The blue forward kicked the ball into the net just before he went out.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Schöneheim, Germany.
Sergeant wants to beat the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no point in him trying to make another start.
But the ever-competitive Serge is hoping to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the Rockies in the playoffs, as they lead by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies have made the playoffs with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock in first place in their division.
"Even though we have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game that is probably the highest level I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight in a fight like that?"
The Nationals haven't announced their starting pitcher yet for Sunday, but they're reportedly leaning toward letting Serge throw the ball.
Serge, who will be making his 34th start, had practice shots on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally his day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump speaks in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation regarding his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in his speech on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is a very important moment. I am not a candidate, but in fact it is as if I am, and for that reason I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates,' he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this miserable, miserable radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to eliminate to get power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have taken on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you've seen it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean, miserable and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, making a name for Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a reference that was met with strong public disapproval.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you uncover the document?
Oh, oh, what?
That was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad faction.
It's not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
I was not at all surprised that Momentum activists in my local group voted to impeach me.
I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, precisely because we are speaking our minds.
My colleague, Joanne Ryan, was similarly treated because she was a determined opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, my impeachment motion was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically, on issues similar to those on which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone involved".
For most of the eight years that I've been a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday nights have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today, there are not that many meetings, and the promise of a "more compassionate, more compassionate" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever really began to be implemented.
It is increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought we shared similar political views began to expect me to make a 180-degree turn and adopt views I would never agree with, whether they were on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke in public, regardless of what I actually said, I heard a chant on social media, where some people were asking for my rejection, rejecting the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And this didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, since the comments made to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never give in.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad faction and that with every motion of censure or change in the rules of election, the party's boundaries are narrowing.
I've been told many times over the last two years not to be tall, not to talk too much and that "everything will be all right" that way.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the Thatcher government which led to the failure of my whole class, my aim has been to secure better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, and I did the same thing in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way as to my political views and my points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that, as the country faces a Brexit that will hit our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not to the members of Momentum in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will stop me from acting as I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Air-Melrose: 38 - 17: The undefeated Air rises to the top
Two late goals may have slightly skewed the final score, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this highly entertaining match of today's Teddle Championship.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was her superior defense, as well as her best use of opportunities, that set the balance in the pitchers' favor, and coach Peter Murcie had every reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Air, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did".
A goal by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Fraser Climax, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card to Scot Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to exploit the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott scored an unconverted goal.
Climax increased Air's lead with a penalty, before scoring, just in halftime, a conversion goal, leading Air to the locker room with a 17-5 score.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggott, cut the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Roarind Nott, who was removed by a stretcher, and, after the restart, Ayr further increased the gap with a goal from Stafford McDowall, with a change of climate.
Deputy captain Blair McPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the numerical advantage with a goal from Bruce Colvin without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The pitchers came back, however, and, when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climate without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored in the back of the attack launched by Air.
Climate made a conversion, as it has done again almost since the reboot, after first Kylie Rowe picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent ex-Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the pitchers.
Still Game star starts a new career in the food business
Still Game protagonist Ford Kiernan seems poised to make the leap into the restaurant industry after it was revealed that he's been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hempfield.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Gayland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wants to tackle the "burgeoning restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Surrounded Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the fully equipped naval headquarters at La Paz.
There are blue flags flying over public buildings.
On naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the slogan is written: "The sea is our rightful property.
It is our duty to get her back".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that Chile conquered after a bloody conflict over natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to the Pacific Ocean once more.
These hopes are now more alive than at any time in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive eye", said Roberto Calzantela, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and force Chile, after decades of volatile talks, to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia, who is fighting a controversial re-election bid next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to give away thousands of acres of land and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision is to be issued just six months after the final arguments are presented suggests that the case "wasn't complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further advancing Bolivia's goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has seized the issue of access to the sea", Zarate reported.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining goodwill in Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually fast.
On Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disputes with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzante also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders, is using the issue of going to sea as a political gimmick.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to move on from the past".
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if the United States cannot be trusted
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
It called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the two heads of state.
Ri made these comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared poised to resume nuclear diplomacy that had reached a dead end three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the idea that continued sanctions and the US refusal to declare the end of the Korean War will eventually force the North to "get down on its knees" is a summer nightmare.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is seriously considering denying an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in supersize hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or avoid the sun altogether, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection on the runway that stole the show at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer, and their designers sent their impressive creations onto the runway.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide, winged bore that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with gems, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also unveiled a series of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to high-fashion tailoring.
One creature suggested full diving equipment with a respirator and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're in luck.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach major shopping streets near you.
The super-size hats made their appearance very quickly after La Bomba, the brown hat with the very wide brim we've seen worn by so many, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media has sent another big creation to the catwalk, a sandy beach bag almost as big as the model who carries it in her swimsuit.
The dark orange shelf bag, decorated with shelf-shells and a white leather handle, was the stand-out piece from Jacquemus's La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and big beach bags in the malls next summer, as the designer has made such a big impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world.
Scotland's independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another string of outstanding test results, which were only further bolstered by individual and collective achievements in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to pupils and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher levels of education, the career they will choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum to order, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, then what you say goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say gets to his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the latest results of this year's exams, we find that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A-level.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A-level in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also had an A-level.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as an elective subject as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that, for reasons why employers were struggling to fill job vacancies, a 17% share was due to lack of language skills.
The need to acquire language skills is therefore becoming increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future professional careers.
Since more future job opportunities require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future because of the skill you can use throughout your life.
If one is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important to the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a language to choose from in independent schools, which have trained teachers in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, and this reality should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scotland's young people.
They have to.
John Edward is the director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland.
LeBron is making his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait to see LeBron make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes has not yet been decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After practice a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers schedule before the season.
"I don't need a prep race at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
The Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies starting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned rallies for Trump next week, including trips to friendly neighborhoods like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his confirmation vote for the Supreme Court pending, Trump is seeking to bolster popular support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been held in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sex crimes, with a Senate confirmation vote put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
However, the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing an uncertain outcome in the November election in order to gain some momentum.
So President Trump's campaign said these five rallies next week are aimed at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as we move into the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
The rally scheduled for tonight at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh's media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican nominee for the West Virginia Senate, who is low in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come and try to give him a boost to the ballot box", said Simon Hender, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has the guts to fight keeping hopes alive as it heads into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon's foursome might be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting idea, but players believe in it deeply, especially in such contests.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"It was six degrees ahead and now it's four, so we're probably a little bit ahead", said Jordan Speith as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead, of course, with 12 points to go.
Americans, as Speith says, feel the wind in their sails and have much to encourage them, like the Speith and Justin Thomas twins who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spith was deadly from teeing on the green and setting an example.
The voices of celebration grew louder as he continued his turn, managing a crucial hit to take the all-square four game when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The blow that won the game on the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show his belief that the American team is not out.
"You have to look deep inside yourself and worry about your own game", said Spith.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to make history.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin of Europe has gotten four out of four and seems to be doing nothing wrong.
The "Mollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
This game, and the way the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy spectators, seals the fact that they are the players who should win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory is still premature.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they put the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into a hole they couldn't get out.
But on Sunday, there'll be no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourball and foursomes are such exciting games to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome match also showed that the US team has the balls, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after their lead in Saturday's fourball and foursome with 10-6 against the USA.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari came in with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far in the four points.
Thomas Byrne's European side, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the flawed American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted the most in the foursome, winning two races, but could not cover the gap.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and along with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a spectacular weekend is only the second twin to win four points in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reid in fourball, they joined forces to crush a tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Desambo with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who has dragged in both Saturday's games, has shown occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven in the series.
Justin Rose, who had rested for the morning fourball, returned to teammate Henry Stenson for the foursome with a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keppa, taking first and third place in the world rankings.
Not all went well for Europe, except for a pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 2&1 victory over John Rum and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome while missing both holes in the opening.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover from a four-point loss in singles, although because he is the trophy winner, Furyk is only able to draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is out of their hands.
North Korea says it won't unilaterally disarm without confidence-building measures.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that his country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and ballistic tests, divesting nuclear test facilities, and committing to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually progresses through the process, his statement was significant in that he did not completely rule out unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "surrender" its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for relaxing the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve its goal by blackmailing, even impeding the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions deepen our distrust".
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had signaled at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the partner on the denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean ballistic missiles was inevitable because "Dirty President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving forward with disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and uninterruptedly until complete, final and confirmed denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralize funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, only to be denounced by North Korea a few hours later as having "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He clarified that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he is seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised Singapore and promote normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes on how to get enough rest
This year, a new study at Harvard University is seeking all undergraduates to get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing culture of overnight study and heavy caffeine consumption.
One academic discovered that students at the world's number one university often do not know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles T. Chiessler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the class after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"Finally, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first started this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that students were sleep deprived during the week to a significant degree.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a student dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another module, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke", added Professor Chiessler.
The culture of boasting about studying all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sufficient, good-quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of college students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation state, resulting in a persistent feeling of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chiessler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a class across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before they begin their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chiessler recommended that students set a bedtime warning and an alarm clock for waking time, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston to Rangers 1-0 , Menga scores to Gerard 's men
The Rangers suffered another tragic defeat away from home, as Dolly Menga's shot led Stephen Gerrard's disorganized side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Iberbrooks were looking to score their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerard's only second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving the team eight points behind first-placed Ladbrokes.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the uninspired Rangers roster seemed unable to fight back.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, just one goal behind Hibernian who are ahead.
And the Rangers may be in for more trouble, as Superintendent Callum Spence was rushed to the emergency room with a head injury caused by an object thrown from the platform.
Gerard made eight changes to the squad and crushed Ayr in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Livie 11" that got a score from Hartz last week and would be pleased with how this well-oiled machine of his was able to smother every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the midfielder didn't find the ball.
A deep free kick by Keegan Jacobs found the leader Craig Halkett, but his teammate's defensive end Alan Lithgow was all he could do to send the ball off the post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed he should have won a penalty in the 15th minute as he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Stephen Thompson ignored the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers had only two shots in the area in the first half, but former Ambrose goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried at all by Lasagna Coulibaly's head and Obi Ezzaria's subtly-scored shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the match Livy was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that she deserved the win for the effort alone.
Again, the Rangers failed to address the Jacobs problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and found Menga who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes at half-time by taking out Coulibaly and putting Ryan Kent, the change worked almost immediately as the winger passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure the guests into the style of play she knows and enjoys, with Lithgow and Hulket removing one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have increased the margin towards the end, but McGregor drew Jacobs, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt from the corner.
Rangers' second baseman Glenn Middleton had another penalty in the end as he collided with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882: as it is today, 136 years ago and VERY... the day in Germany that the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the device now known as the Geiger meter.
A pillar of science ever since, the Geiger counter has made its way into the pop culture realm, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive metal elements, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of the atoms caused by the radioactivity in the metal elements".
Evans: "Look, he's acting like a madman!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues its work.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" problem cells
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" problem cells and kill them
A vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells as part of a treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that is common to various cancers and then be re-infected
A vaccine under trial is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received treatment with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize problem cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzowski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
As Professor Berzowski explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force behind the development of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended Trump by wearing a hat with the slogan MAGA after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was dismissed in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an off-screen interview in which he praised US President Donald Trump and stated that he would run for the 2020 election.
After performing his third song for the night, titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a delusional recital against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to a white guy a lot, and he says, "But how do you like Trump? He's a racist".
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with the Hollywood star comedying Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blazy Ford's sexual abuse allegations.
Although not aired, the video of West's delusion was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make a joke out of West with this post.
West also complained to the audience that he was treated badly backstage because of his hat.
"I was being bullied backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat".
They bowled me!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "I don't know what's going on with me. I'm gonna wear the Superman cape, 'cause then nobody can tell me what to do.
Try the love".
His comments were disapproved of at least twice by the audience and the SNL staff seemed to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person telling the magazine: "The whole studio was dead silent".
West was called in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused a lot of people when he sang "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU for standing up to the gang".
However, the show's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's great".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe is embracing and promoting an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
So do we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the being previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course music legend Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is critical of toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO crime-fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor criticizes the macho hero stereotype, saying that such screen roles send the message to young boys that they must be tough to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something is going wrong" and wondered how to combat the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to having a "strong opinion" on the subject.
"Personally, now, I really believe that. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What are we learning from men as they get older, in relation to the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity because of the masculine characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must display such behavior to be men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time: How can we change that?
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people".
In the interview he also admitted that he has no plans to star in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel, after the series ends next summer, saying "end of battles and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever had out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so it kind of gave me my future family and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Hygrid, the love-obsessed repulse of John Snow, the character played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, more than 820,000 people are affected, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the overwhelming majority of cases, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost been eliminated, as Chinese health officials had stated at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the L.O.A.T. community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an executive leaked data on Republican senators, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff published personal information about three Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Republican lawmaker argued that the allegations were being promoted by "far-right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more awful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Harts of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday and appears to have been posted by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and published the details of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and a blatant lie".
Waters's statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This denial is full of anger", wrote Fleischer.
"That shows he doesn't have the guts to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be rude.
He must not question the motives of his accuser.
He must be calm and peaceful".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it is real", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations".
"We will do everything to find those responsible", he continued, "and hold them accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Back is a subtly spy film starring Rowan Atkinson.
It's now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new British feature film, and that seems to be true in this revival of the action-comedy franchise starring Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English: The Return.
Could this humorous self-deprecating satire about how obviously bad we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Inglis with the curly eyes was able to renew his license to make them mandarin for the second time.
This is, of course, the dashing secret agent who, while pretending to have the glamour and manners of a secret agent, brings a little bit of Clouseau, with a touch of "Mr. Bean" and something from the guy who played one note on the theme music of the movie "Roads of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also based on the traveller and international mystery man once played by Atkinson in the most forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, sowing chaos in his wake.
There's a good moment or two in this latest J.E. film.
I liked it when Johnny Inglis approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent for comedy, however, the humor is quite subdued and oddly over-the-top, especially at a time when "serious" film franchises like 007 and Dangerous Mission now include quite a bit of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children and not adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy twists are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson's silent-film-style sketches about the character of Bean.
The perennial theme is that Britain has a serious problem.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret online spy network, exposing the identities of all British agents on assignment, much to the disappointment of the acting agent, played by Kevin Eldon in a role unfortunately short-sighted.
It's the last straw for a pompous and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse because of political anti-populism: Emma Thompson does her best with this Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn't help her much.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she will have to bring back someone disarmed.
And that means Johnny Inglis, who now works as a principal at some elite school, but gives informal classes for secret agents: here are some nice scenes, as Inglis offers a spy academy like One School Very Rock.
Inglis returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with Buff's former and passionate associate, again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role that Vicky Pepperdine doesn't fully play.
So Batman and Robin of the Secret Service of Her Majesty's return to action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ofelia Bulletova played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously fascinated by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's technological woes: the menacing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglis and Buff begin their farce odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a sleek French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to illegally board Volta's luxury yacht, and Inglis causes anarchy as he attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and noisy as it is, it still reminds me a little of children's TV.
It's the little things.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really will grow with his talent?
Labour denies considering a plan to make British people work four days but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is about to consider a radical plan to make the British work four days a week, but be paid for five days' work.
The party reportedly seeks to channel the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
So, the workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the tables on the workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A change in policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party's overall strategy for industry".
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
The shadow government's secretary, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour conference to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he's determined to take back power from the "person managers" and "profit scouts" in the utility companies.
The shadow government secretary's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full stake back, as a potential Labour government could make "seizures" over suspected insolvencies.
It also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to set up mutual funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are on 60 Minutes talking about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said that on my way to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him directly, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, categorical".
However, Graham's vote does not appear to be about to change.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to take some explosive charge to change my mind", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
"And whoever it is, they can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and celebrity stars, but an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year in a row, tens of thousands are expected to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international lobbying group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), participants had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or finding other meaningful ways to contribute to awareness of their goal to eradicate poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen, with 12 years to go?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "click-activism", where people feel like they're really making a difference by signing an email petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen group reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a range of different goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers, who have made a commitment "to help children reach their full potential", pledging to give Rwanda $35 million to eradicate malnutrition, having received over 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracy Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, which addresses 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In answer to the question "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?" that is included in the FAQ,
One member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and hard, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great human rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because united we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mona are among the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jackman.
US may use Navy to 'block' by impeding Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may turn to its Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from being made available to markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reasons they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said, according to sources.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, block them, to ensure that Russian energy is not made available to the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "a pig that knows only one trick" as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration has taken on the mission of boosting U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin "armed" by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, an $11 billion project that is to double the existing capacity of the pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance provoked a reaction from Germany, which stressed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, city hall, Warren confirmed that she was looking into the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and for that, we need a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider a run for the presidency".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren didn't bite her tongue about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote".
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe he should run for president in 2020.
58% of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other popular names from the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he'll have a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to post-traumatic stress disorder by Track Palin at the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"With what my son has been through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the wounds our soldiers carry when they return home", he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to go off" and said of her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back harder, they come back wondering if there's respect for what the soldiers, the airmen and every other member of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" were abusing her, however, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a large number of asylum seekers coming to the United States, as countries with severe gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence situations to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Under federal law, all asylum claims must be considered in light of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "form a necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims trying to escape from situations of domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or intimidation because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo as the death toll doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very intense", said 35-year-old mother Riza Kusuma, trying to comfort her baby with a fever at an evacuation center set up in the devastated city of Palo.
"Every minute, more bodies are being brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce".
Some residents tried to return to their destroyed homes and collect their belongings through the water, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were unable to meet needs.
Some injured, such as Dewey Harris, who suffered a broken hip and shoulder, remained outside the Palo Army Hospital, where first aid was being given outdoors because of the ongoing strong quakes.
Tears flowed from his eyes as he related how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the rubble of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper hyping the mutual trade benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump was quoted last Wednesday in a paid China Daily op-ed that appeared in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
Although foreign governments are not prohibited from advertising their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war and have imposed various tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Brandt, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brandt wrote in an op-ed in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "has indulged in this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"In trying to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America's precious heritage of free speech and a free press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Brandstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the Beijing stands, you will find few divergent voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic course, given that the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers turned down the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which one.
Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections because of the Cavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn there will be a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment on this issue is particularly tense and most Republicans have indicated that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be fixed", Grant Reer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute move to request an FBI investigation will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they're not going to forget it tomorrow, and they're certainly not going to forget it in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national press officer for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the corridor of the Senate as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee gave the green light for Kavanaugh's nomination, despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, Mic reported.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will reach record levels", Stu Rodenberg, a political analyst, told the news site.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of undecided suburban female voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, while dislike the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed her sexual abuse allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had predicted that there might be a backlash if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be voted out, it's about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats win, told a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe after the testimonies of Fortne and Kavanaugh, leaning slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's move, the FBI took it upon itself to investigate the allegations of Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while at a party when they were both students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup with the goal of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The newest addition to this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source Solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own 'personal electronic data storage' or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a diary, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available in one browser and all at once.
The unique feature of the personal electronic data storage space is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this capability "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project, and a community of volunteer code developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, overturning business models overnight.
"We don't ask their permission".
In a Medium post released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next Internet age", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Honouring a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday a memorial plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren, accompanied by a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the plaque's unveiling was made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion into the Seine-Candon Canal amidst very thick fog and heavy fire from battle-guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "exceptional bravery" led the line forward, before striking three of the platoon with a single combat weapon.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic deeds were "something I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel boundless respect".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Philharmonic Band.
Michael Van said that he "felt very honored to be in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is proved by the support he has from many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Pig.
Consider the following scenario: You stay up all night to watch the thrilling Bellator 206, but you are deprived of the joy of watching this unique sporting event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would be broadcast live in the United Kingdom, by Channel 5, in the nighttime zone.
At 6:00am, as Gerhard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to step into the ring, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the show changed to Peppa the Pig.
Some were not happy at all, having stayed up until the early hours of the morning especially for the race.
One Twitter follower described the screening of the children's program as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be shown", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig, of course".
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they were going to revise the programme to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the replay, I think we can do it", said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our time, which is their Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the switch was made, there was a lot of texting back and forth, and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you, next time, that's not going to happen.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to give the fans more, and we went overboard.
It is an unpleasant situation".
Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that pushed him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren LaVerne on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that since becoming a parent, he is less interested in winning an Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a regular on the popular radio program, was on sick leave for several months.
As a guest on LaVerne's first show, Daily said he felt "inadequate" compared to others growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable for someone to like both boys and girls".
She said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference have given me the strength and the will to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent advocate for LGBT rights and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to move towards decriminalizing homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly, without consequences, and that he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was "a surprise" when she fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daily married Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years older than him, but he maintained that the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (he first competed in the Olympics at age 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a peer who has similar ups and downs".
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dailey, and Dailey said it changed "his whole perspective".
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal", he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, Dad, you're not going to be around to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was dead did I finally accept that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, to compete in diving at the Olympics in my homeland, there was no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which cheered him up in preparation for the Olympics and still gives him chills.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-shape Mickelson will be sitting on the bench Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to improve his performance so he's not remembered for the wrong reasons.
Mickelson, who is making his 12th (record number) appearance in the biennial tournament, was forced by captain Jim Furyk to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he is for the United States, the five-time winner has spent the day cheering up from the sidelines and "working" his game hoping to correct his problem areas.
Without ever having been the fastest driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old's game is not suited to the narrow course of Le Golf National, where distances are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the field wasn't enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is teaming up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mickelson's play could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he was playing today, he patted me on the back, put his hand around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has great confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he's done so much for these teams, both last week and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him playing two games.
I thought more, but that's where we ended up and so we felt we had to go.
He wants to go out there, like everybody else".
Mickelson is about to surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday games in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that didn't reach the height of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make jokes, and he's excellent in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun teasing him this week.
His contribution is not just to the game".
The European Group leader, Thomas Byrne, knows that the big lead could soon be lost
Thomas Byrne, the European team captain, knows from experience that a big lead starting with the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a defeat.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros managed to take a five-point lead over the Americans, but barely managed to cross the finish line by breast, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely", Bjorn said, pictured, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going to go tomorrow ready to give it all.
We're gonna go out there and play it right.
Nothing's over until you see the scores on the scoreboard.
We have one goal, to win this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know very well that the other team has equally good players - the best in the world".
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I would not be in a hurry to predict the outcome.
Tomorrow is another beast.
Tomorrow is about individual performance, and that's different.
It's great to be on the court with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there by yourself, that's when you test your golf skills to the limit.
That's the message you need to get to the players, how to bring out the best in them tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it his all and show his best".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than they had with their teammates, except for Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both extremes of the upheavals of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe performed its miracle.
"I remember every word he said", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players for the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like in Medina.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the interim matches.
We decide our turn accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we'll try to do our magic tomorrow".
Thomas has taken over the lead of the match and is facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rum, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the series.
"I went with this group in this series because I think it covers the whole way", said Bjorn justifying his choices for singles.
New postponement for the new German warship
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it will not be picked up until at least next year due to faulty systems and inflated costs, local media report.
The commissioning of the frigate Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but delivery problems were decisive for the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as the new frigates will be able to be used for up to two years outside German ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that although the warships are considered state-of-the-art, which will allow Germany to show off its power abroad until they are finally put into service, they will already be obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after surrender.
Not much information has been made public about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of significant "defects in software and hardware" that would render the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half as many as the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much larger weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to weigh twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the whole project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion (€3.6 billion) against an initial budget of €2.2 billion.
The problems plaguing the new frigates are particularly important as Germany's naval strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon be without ships for missions".
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships have been scrapped, but there are no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research on a farm in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt for food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help plan future actions to protect the environment.
The study by National Trust scientists for Scotland will investigate the habits of the common dwarf and small bat, as well as the brown bat and Dobbenden's myotis at Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the farm to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held sensors.
Analyzing the sound of all the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bats' calls, as well as which species have this behavior.
A habitat map and a report will then be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape scale.
Rob Duar, environmental adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect their nesting sites and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also hazards, as are fly-stick tapes and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes for catching their prey.
They use an advanced technique of sonication to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, considers bats to be very important.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct searches, inspect bat nesting sites, and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has also set up Scotland's first and only bat-only sanctuary at Threave Farm, in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, states that the estate is the ideal habitat for bats.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent bat area", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of tall trees and an ideal habitat.
There is still much we don't know about bats, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow their populations".
It stresses that it is important to check for bats before any home maintenance work, since the destruction of a single nest of young could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them, disturb their peace or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an executive with the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer their help.
He said: "There is much to be learned about our bats, and for many of our species we simply do not know the evolution of their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying that some "want to present themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The Portugal national team and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not report anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to make themselves known and take advantage of my name.
It's only natural.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and all is well", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations it published, which they called "unacceptable reporting of rumors that touch on privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Skerch said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage of a magnitude commensurate with the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mallorca returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her unintentionally according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mallorca claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy", but was betrayed by the other "one percent".
The documents say that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Mayorgha also claims that she went to the police and a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she "feared retaliation" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she's trying to reverse the settlement, as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder because of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus securing a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' the loss of its car industry
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Bernaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Bernaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will have a shutdown of production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern supply chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit, according to the car manufacturers.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars built to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the borders, resulting in delays and shortages of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock beyond one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU 'specifically attempts to resolve the issue of cross-border checks'.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal possible that will allow us not just a temporary success but to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
'The evidence coming not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is imperative to ensure continuity of supply chains.'
Toyota was unable to say how much of the production would be discontinued, however, it warned that in the long run the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tshuvallaris, who has worked at Bernaston for 24 years and is the union leader of Unite at the factory, said that union members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, if these jobs are lost, they're never coming back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's landmark meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed another week" as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump aides' ties to Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
The possibility that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a buzzword in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record his conversations with Trump and make possible the removal of the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he moved into the White House last Monday amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a vote by the full Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's spokeswoman, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set yet, maybe this week, but maybe it will be postponed another week given all the other cases that are in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists countered this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of updates was not due to a dislike of the "impression" moves of TV reporters, although she said: "I won't argue with the fact that they are shown".
Then he hinted that there would be increased direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president gives more interviews than any previous president", he said, adding without citing details: "We looked at those numbers".
Updates will continue to be conducted, Sanders said, but "if the press has the ability to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's incomparably better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of the press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States".
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with official guests.
Individual press interviews are rare.
This week in New York the president has probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
Health Minister sends letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health Service amid fears over Brexit
The Minister for Health sent a letter to EU citizens employed in Scotland's National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and to wish them well to remain after the UK leaves the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: 'The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer and are on track to reach decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a particularly difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery following head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive back Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean newspaper reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the counter and just collapsed there", Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the bench and then put him on a stretcher and transported him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information yet on the type/extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK, with the extra money used to help the homeless, according to the Tories' new plans.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxable UK buyers
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises of cheaper housing and targeting the high-wage.
The increase in the stamp fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the UK, while the additional money will support the government's campaign to combat homelessness.
The increase in the current stamp duty, together with the higher tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and rental homes, may amount to three per cent.
The Treasury expects the measure to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new homes in London are bought by non-UK residents, leading to higher prices and further making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the property market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp fee so more young people could get their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by acquiring land without using it and called on Mrs May to abolish ceilings on affordable housing in order to restore Britain's "housing shame".
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on "innocent" evictions.
He also wants to give greater powers to councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for non-UK residents and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hard-working British nationals.
For too many people the dream of home ownership has become too distant, and the indignity of homelessness remains".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach the Scottish national team".
Sunderland captain Jack Ross says his "absolute ambition" is to one day become the coach of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of reviving the North East England side, who are currently third in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having previously brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up watching the Scottish team in Hampden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something that always drew me back.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in team coaching".
Among Ross's predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio. He was also a member of the band, the band's first ever, and the band's only constant member.
The former Aloe Athletic manager reports that he felt no fear when called upon to succeed such established names at such a large club, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, my success will be measured by the answer to the question, 'Can I get this team back into the Premier League?'
"The club is a Premier League club, and because of its structure and facilities, it is unquestionably a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not easy work getting there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there".
Ross began his coaching career just three years ago, having spent a stint as an assistant coach at Darburton and a 15-month stint on the Hart coaching staff.
He then helped Alouas back from relegation to the third division and led St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship the following season.
Ross also says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was more of a real crossroads", he said, recalling his takeover as coach of Aloe.
"I really thought I was better suited to be a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, I was making decent money out of it, and I had gotten pretty high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to put up with a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still struggling with the stress and pressure of the job, but the coaching job is perfect for me.
I've always wanted to train, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable with myself than I have in my entire adult life".
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 British Summer Time.
The best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a study.
The summer heat boosted profits for Britain's test pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the data, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup run resulted in July following a similar pattern to the previous month, June, where pub profits rose 2.8 percent, but restaurants took an even bigger hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenue in June just got worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcohol fared much better, with their figures for previous years rising more than their figures for restaurants fell.
Food-serving pubs also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all pubs and bars operated, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell by three percent".
Paul Newman, from the leisure and hospitality analysts at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales on the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a fall in sales of 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for entrepreneurs in the restaurant sector and time will tell whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will provide a much-desired extension".
The overall increase in pub and restaurant sales, including new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in launching brand names.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over £9 million, and is the established benchmark for the sector.

Twenty percent of the students said they have a "master" account to show to their parents
One in five children - even as young as 11 - set up social networking accounts, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - a reference to the photo sharing website Instagram.
This news has fueled fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said that they keep a healthy "master" account to show to their parents, while maintaining private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website spotted a teenager urging others to rape her ("rape me").
The survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are succumbing to the temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot locate them".
Eilind Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish track and field council.
Eilind Doyle was elected as a non-executive director on the Scottish Steering Board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and President Ian Beatty commented on her election as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilind enjoys immense respect throughout the Scottish, British and global steve community and we are confident that steve in Scotland will benefit immensely from her entry into the council", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be the voice of the athletes and hope to be able to actually contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, having won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, was left paralyzed after a transient ischemic stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I'll recover.
It was exhausting, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A mammal advertisement comparing mothers to cows divides online public opinion
A dairy company has divided the Internet public with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To launch what is being called the "world's first silent, wearable breast milk", consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous video-inspired ad to highlight the freedom that the new breast milk gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay, with a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, those aren't breasts, those are my tits".
The chorus goes on: "Feed it, pump it, I feed babies, pump it, pump it, soften my ladies".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it does not take the "horror" of the dairy industry seriously.
"Very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal it a few days after birth", one commentator observed.

Another commented: "Apparently traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breastfeeding mothers who can hold their babies?"
Another added: "A commercial completely out of reality".
Others defended the ad, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "hilarious".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a sucker like that if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I didn't try to overanalyze it.
It's a brilliant product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "It is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who are breast-feeding (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an advertisement praising or criticizing the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were all dancing with their distinctive nipples tucked into their bras.
The rationale behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who breast-feed say they feel like cows.
The Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies, and even get out during the pumping.
Anna Ballarin, partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and challenging launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the pumping of breast milk and all the challenges it entails, while also showing in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new mammal will bring.
This isn't the first time the mammal Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for fashion designer Marta Yakubovsky while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in detention has reached record highs, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to match children with conservatives.
Traditionally, most of the conservatives are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid to come forward and ask for a child and thus jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk intensified in June when federal authorities announced that potential dependents and other adult household members would have to give their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alpens, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who requested to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either dependents or dependent household members are in the country illegally and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the EU's financial assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In order to speed up the processing of children's cases, officials introduced new rules that some of these children would have to appear in court within a month of the start of their detention, not 60 days, as was previously the case, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to develop their claims for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for exemption will be deported immediately.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to become stressed or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are heightened in larger facilities such as Torneo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to go unnoticed, due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the scene without giving them enough time to prepare psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can aggravate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alim also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Muammar, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muammar insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy battle until we drive out all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and inform both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said conditions are good for their return and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that have pushed refugees to stay away from their country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They politicize an issue that should be purely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Muammar stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who would be "neutralized".
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new commission composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Muammar laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying that the commission's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Because Trump is going to win a second term.
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandals end his presidency early.
Which would be, without a doubt, "The most dramatic presidential end of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of any tiredness in the audience.
Since 2014, viewership in the high-definition television zone has more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime time zone, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has swept the satellite television ratings, with 3.5 million viewers on prime time nights.
It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand", said Neil Baer, producer of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor", where a cabinet minister becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
He remembers a cab ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
Her driver said she was gonna vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked "why?"
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
You can have fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike what happens with TV shows, the scenarios coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roy v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Switching frequencies is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you're beyond the definition of an informed citizen when you spend six hours watching a panel of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "multiple backstage interviews" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket ("a garment full of ivy", according to the Washington Post), and the consequences of Storm Daniels's glib descriptions of Mr. Trubb's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"What it does and what it gives you the feel of reality shows is that it gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the television program "Pawn Stars", about the ever-changing cast and the daily twists and turns in the plot of Trump's show (blatant fights with the NFL, praising Kim Yong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you're left behind.
When I met with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny day at 26 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while he taped CNN.
He couldn't get it off, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
"I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying, 'This is going to be the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Foreign money enters the most marginal contest for the midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving a cash flow, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that put two incumbent members of Congress up for the same position.
This recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburban district is represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who was elected in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is facing another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that the old districts were being unconstitutionally manipulated to the benefit of Republicans.
The election contest in the new 17th electoral district sparked a campaign of financial competition between the parties' largest funding units, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after he narrowly won a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was watched by a large crowd.
This seat has been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts are giving the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but backed down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting a mild reaction from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and maintained a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", as Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about US$140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the migration of refugees to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively ending the thinking of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the great importance the gathering has for the administration, diplomats said.
All three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House press secretary on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Read history
The next blow may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, for which very strong evidence has now been released.
It is rumored that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation to the possibility of collusion between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia regarding the Russian attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body as he prepares to run for president again in the next election and possibly eventually in a jury trial.
The "ifs" are many, and I'm not implying that the fall of Mr. Trump, or his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the uncontrollable course of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was reported in that paper last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and that he considered him unfit for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version adopted by the Times is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite substantiated charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, the republic will enter a long winter.
But, because of the lesson I learned in Pragma, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light Jewish Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna .
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain with Viarreal earlier this month, will give them plenty of chances to qualify from Group 7 of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Viareal, but he believes Rangers can use this as a springboard for further success.
"It was a good moment for us because Virreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We came into the game thinking we could accomplish something and we came out with a point.
Perhaps we could have gotten away with it in the end, but, in general, the draw was a fairly fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were a better team in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another big European night.
Well, given the circumstances, we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in their last game, but, with the crowd on the podium, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, because of my injuries and the changes that were made to the team itself, but there's a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids are enjoying it, the training is good.
Let's hope we can do our best now, put last season behind us and succeed".
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement savings
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care for you if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your financial adviser can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid repurchase-price life insurance to help you cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Have a healthcare proxy appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid in the event of your becoming incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the money, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan".
Man shot multiple times with a shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a shotgun as he walked home last night.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon County when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Summer Time, as "an accidental event".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries he sustained are not life-threatening and police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Paloh on Friday, according to official sources, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications cut off, aid forces have been unable to get information from Donggala, a region north of Palo, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster erupted.
The following are some important facts about Palo and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a kingdom stretching along more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline in the southwest of Sulawesi Island.
The viceroyalty, a grade of administrative division below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is more common in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palo and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located within the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with over half in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds dead on Nia Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake with a epicenter near the city of Pandang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mendawi Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-focal-depth earthquake struck the Pindi Jaya area of Aceh, causing devastation and panic as it brought to the world memories of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it didn't cause a tsunami, but over 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice for domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crimes she allegedly committed, he snatched the phone from her hands.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su temporary detention facility, on a $500 bond, as reported by KTUU television.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he stated "certainly, innocent" when questioned, the network reports.
Palin faces three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin has been prosecuted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice for the crime of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His partner claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veterans' groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the catastrophic event are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death sentence for the suspect in the New York terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipoff, the suspect in the New York terror attack that claimed the lives of eight people - a rare sentence to be imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipoff, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot van to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists in his path on October 31.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and inflicted grievous bodily harm "intentionally", according to the statement of intent to execute the death sentence, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry the death penalty, according to the affidavit.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov to trial on a 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of murder for organized crime, a tactic often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "horrible, cruel and despicable".
"Saipulov Habibulayevich Saipov has caused pain, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, Ann-Lor Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panuko", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District Court of New York prosecuted a case involving the death penalty.
The defendant, Halind Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was imposed in New York was in 1953 on the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipoff, a national of Uzbekistan, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt satisfied with his act, according to police.
Saipoff told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag planted in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts listed in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they are "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma that the events have caused for all involved", Patton said.
Saipoff's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest rally at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs said he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK "would have already left" by now if Mr Farage was the minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underscored by the fact that Tories in favour of remaining in the EU attended a separate anti-Brexit protest rally in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise plan under control amid attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she go ahead with her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash, and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihull that he wanted to throw out "the Checkers plan".
He said that Mr Farage should have been knighted and given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we'd be gone by now", he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit but we have to throw out the Checkers plan".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to become subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Mr Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The speculation that the British people have changed their minds and wish to stay is completely untrue".
Pro-Brexit Tory MP Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan has no public approval, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it has no approval from our party and our activists who are taking to the streets and voting for us.
Please drop the Checkers plan and start listening".
In a sharp message to Mrs May, he added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage told the protest rally that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now there is a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you get away with this.'
In a message to the elated crowd, he added: "I want you to make the class of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, pro-Remain protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Few activists waved Tory anti-Brexit banners after the group rally this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they faced with a party app at the start of the convention.
"They are the same people who are telling us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Canada enrichment type of agreement, for unimpeded borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
"This is a complete failure.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke about her future plans during a rally at a Western Massachusetts town hall on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November, facing Republican state representative Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's a lot of speculation that he might be able to compete with Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters using the city hall structures since the start of Trump's term.
A person present at the meeting asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to rebuild our broken government, and that meant a woman had to be at the top.
Arrest for fatal shooting of LSU Sims basketball player
LAPD in Baton Rouge announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Deaton Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11pm eastern time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was fatally shot near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which led to his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Wade stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene with a gun in his possession and admitted to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and is being held at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-3, 190-pound Sims, a third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton goes for the world title as team instructions give him the win over Sebastian Fettel
It became clear from the moment Valterie Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's commands would play a major role in the race.
At the start Botta had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to the pits first and let Hamilton run in the tail of the race, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pits one lap later and came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior due to the risk of succumbing to the double-track violation to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then remained in first for much of the race, as he held his tyres aiming to finish fast and pass ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his speed for the remaining eight laps, as Raikkonen came fourth.
It's a tough day because Valterie's been fantastic all weekend and he's been a real gentleman to let me in.
The team did exceptionally well and made it one-two", said Hamilton.
Body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she didn't leak Christine Blazy Ford's letter, in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a gathering in West Virginia, the president did not immediately mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was happening in the Senate proved that people were "malicious and miserable and liars".
"The one thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's been happening these last few days in the Senate, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and mean and miserable and liars", he said.
"When you see publications and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak the information?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
If we leaked... No, we didn't leak", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details about the charges against Kavanaugh in July and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked".
But her refusal did not seem to convince the president much, who commented during the Saturday meeting: "I'll tell you what, the body language was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president implied that Democrats are using the charges to serve their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power using any means necessary.
You see the malice, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to take power and control", the president said according to the news website Mediaite.
Elite League, the Danish Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dandy .
Dundee Stars have made up for their loss in Friday's Elite League game to the Belfast Giants, winning the 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy lead with two shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney brought the pitching game to a tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee and then two goals from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who were coming off a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the scoring in the fourth minute at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford provided the assist thanks to which Bouvier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an action-packed opening period, Sullivan put the volleyball team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave the assist for the tie from Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal of the night toward the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bussar again tied with a power-show goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dandy the lead for the first time in the match towards the end of the second period and he secured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero after he lost his life trying to secure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing due to a major earthquake that hit Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But despite his colleagues running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the furiously swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Siret said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television network ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Baliqapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"We are shocked by his death", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, while the country's disaster management agency says access to the towns of Donggala, Shigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be higher, as many bodies are still under rubble, many of which we have not been able to reach", said the agency's spokesman, Suto Purguo Nogroho.
Waves as high as 20 feet destroyed the Palo, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Reza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jean Gelfant, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to save survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work around the clock to complete any evacuation work.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crashes into lake
The airline that operated a plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports one man missing, while earlier it said all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon it was unable to track down a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ran aground in the lagoon outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went too low.
"This is extremely good", said Janice.
Janes said that he and others managed to make their way through the water that reached them midway to the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working nearby to improve a dock also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the ship sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline collisions registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these collisions involved Air Niugini.
Analyst quotes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its arraignment Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to sequence the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location files from several cell phones showing Telles was with Chambers the night of her death, refuting his earlier claims, as reported by the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone the entire time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tells was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Telles said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell records showed they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Telles deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its arraignment on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be put to jury deliberation.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip-hop has moved away from its roots, which were political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A nanny in New York sues a couple who fired her after receiving a "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a couple for racial dismissal after receiving a text message mistakenly sent by her mother, who complained that the nanny was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist, likening the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she realized that new nanny Giselle Morris was black just after the last one showed up for her first day on the job in 2016.
"No other black", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
Once she realized her mistake, the now-unskilled Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had not done a good job at all and was waiting in her place a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris got paid for her one and only day's work and then she was sent home on Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has sued the couple for dismissal and is seeking compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the six-month job as a domestic nanny, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do things like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discretionary treatment".
The couple dismissed the claims that they were racist, saying it was logical to fire Morris, as they feared they could not trust her again after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now".
Likening the lawsuit to "blackmail", Plasco said that his wife had just given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you go after someone in that condition?
It's not that kind of a thing", the banker added.
While the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion hastened to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers would not show interest in a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about Paddington's huge success".
She said her father, who worked as a photographer at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a teddy bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet-bitter", as her father passed away last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a fairly quiet man and was not arrogant", he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of it even if it's not your own achievement in reality.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
"Though it was a work of his own and his own imagination, "he always gave credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and telling me that it was very bad, that he didn't have much hope of making it", said Mrs. Ednan-Lapérouze.
"At some point, Nad called to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly being reduced and were being excreted from her body.
He was already dead a few hours before that, and now everything was erased.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapérouge, who has so far mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were unaware of the ordeal she was undergoing.
"No one knew", he said.
"I had my head down and tears running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt a sense of pity for Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women mourning the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to stop other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a Welsh bridge with encouraging messages and phone numbers to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lindney, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the room".
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "in very bad shape".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be an impact".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Do not keep silent - you must speak".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her 15-year-old companion, Mark, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt down or sad or anything like that", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had been down on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye".
He said that his death caused them a huge trauma, but they have to get over it: "It breaks up the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited-length, limited-subject investigation - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be dissolved amid entrenched partisan deadlocks.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, they will be significantly weakened in their effort to win the person they want on the nation's highest court.
George Walker Bush is calling Senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is filed?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to get a majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels is falling under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 dissenters last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges for smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly deport them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong-il blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, we will in no way disarm our country unilaterally first", Mr Reem said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court out of self-interest.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi commented on Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with great emotion, denied the accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his inauguration, Kavanaugh was deeply moved, sometimes almost screaming, and his voice trembled as he spoke about his family and his school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him a "terrible and coordinated political assassination of character", organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he's excluded himself with these statements and the way he's done it against the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi responded when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his appointment is confirmed and the Democrats win a majority in the House.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's serving at this moment", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roy v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait for us to say, 'Isn't that great?' " said Pelosi.
And women should have it in their possession.
It's a justified outburst, months and years of anger are pouring in, and she can't get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't find that unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And so it just kept going.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed as an outburst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of a job I used to do in a male-dominated office is of one time I was crying in unspeakable rage and an older woman grabbed me by the neck - a cold-hearted manager whom I had always been slightly afraid of - and pulled me up a ladder.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be glad they broke you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and left the race humiliated, Mrs. Schrader, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"It wasn't such a wise decision", he told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign had already begun, he was behind on funding, so he vowed not to run unless he had raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, were only giving her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was very emotionally charged - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of representatives, and anger with sexism - that felt a strain on her neck.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", recalls Mrs. Schroeder of the press' reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my headstone?
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war may do Beijing good
The congratulatory cheers of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week, with new tariffs on $200 million worth of goods, essentially taxing half of all products imported into the US from China.
Beijing has always returned fire in kind, and recently imposed tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 million worth of goods.
China is determined to retaliate against the American fire, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to put it down any time soon.
To succeed in making Washington retreat, he would have to yield to their demands, but to bow in public in the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, U.S. pressure in the trade war could be positive for China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have admitted in the past", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country devastated by seven (and more) years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alim said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to flee their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Mu'aleem said that aid to rebuild the destroyed country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe locks in victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The American team has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took the lead again, as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA team star Phil Mickelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, threw his par-3 shot into the water on the 16th hole, handing the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone through all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player of the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olsen.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, has gone 2-1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia was crowned the most successful European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy we got the trophy back.
It's all about the team and I'm happy I was able to help", said Garcia, moved after the European victory.
He's giving the bowling alley to fellow American John Rum, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-on-one match on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 major titles and been surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a target, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought it.
At some point this morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
And all 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us".
Red tide update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota provinces
The latest release from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, asymmetric spotting conditions are observed in areas of the provinces of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
A spot of the Red Tide stretches for about 130 miles of coastline from the northern province of Pinellas to the southern province of Lee.
