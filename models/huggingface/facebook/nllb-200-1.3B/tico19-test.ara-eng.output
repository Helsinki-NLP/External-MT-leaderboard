Rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that while the stage varies by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should increase their preparedness for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases of unknown pathogenic causes were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness; that is, they have respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In about 14%, COVID-19 has worsened to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% are seriously ill requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in cumulative COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After what happened in China, COVID-19 is spreading increasingly geographically and following the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world, currently the dynamics of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurvival, Spiteri and others reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases according to the WHO definition of the condition.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 for people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and this date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases.
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the reported COVID-19 cases in each country around the world, which are only available from official sources such as the country's health ministry, national and regional health authorities, and the World Health Organization, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases that have been intermittent over 14 days, and then took into account the normal course of COVID-19 in all EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of cases reported from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., with comparison to the number in Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases observed over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases began to increase on or around 21 February, and then increased sharply on or around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have reported a total number of cases that is already similar to that in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19s indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, and despite the fact that national public health responses vary, and the possibility of country-specific definitions and protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases across the EU/EEA are available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they must be collected in a systematic manner to supplement existing surveillance data focused on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010 study11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and mid-care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and average care per 100,000 people in 2010).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK for the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with a risk of &gt; 90% exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
Since cases have so far been collected in specific regions in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and ICUs usually serve specific regional population groups, it is preferable to provide information on cases and ICU at the level of the Regional Statistical Unit Designation 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
So countries, hospitals and ICU's need to prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients who need health care, especially ICU, like this one that is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid Risk Assessment, the comprehensive preventive rapid approach is essential to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as the shift from containment to mitigation approaches, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is limited opportunity for countries to step up their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has killed more than 3,000 people and injured more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2, like its cousin, SARS-CoV, which caused thousands of people to contract SARS in 2003, can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and affects older adults than younger ones and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics of disease epidemiology, its causes, its virology, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prognosis, and its prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday period and for many weeks afterwards due to a new viral disease outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COVID-19) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the related disease was named COVID-19.
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is public enemy number one and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies on COVID-19 have been published, including the virology of the disease, its epidemiology, its causes, its diagnosis, and its treatment, since the first report was released on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated through many patients.
This review aims to summarize the research progress in the new and rapidly developing field.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another CFS-related disease, MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prediction, as well as some pressing questions that are still being raised.
Coronavirus have traditionally been considered non-fatal human pathogens, and are primarily responsible for about 15% of the four common colds.
Yet, in this century, we've faced two serious human disease-causing coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries at a terrifying rate of spread and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of unknown origin pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, infections among healthcare providers were reported, indicating the possibility of transmission from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed with all public transportation suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and some 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final extent of the outbreak and its severity still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rXaHP1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but it primarily affects people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half of those infected (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread among groups in and around Hubei primarily.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction number was 3.77 (95% confidence range: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted baseline reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people is increasing exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travel operations before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (confidence range 95%: 1.10-1.86%) and the modified mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (confidence range 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60), and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a family of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single, directionally positive ribosome DNA genome.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and the alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The S-coated fork of the sugar protein binds to its cellular receptors, the enzyme-converting angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipetayl peptidase 4 (DPB4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral ribosome DNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the ribosome DNA, accompanied by envelope proteins and nucleated vesicle proteins, forms vesicles containing ferrions, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new beta-CoV variant with a genetic identity greater than 99.98% among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Electron microscopy of transmission revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in extremely thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
The human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 with a weaker binding than SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make a short-chain protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any range or pattern of known function.
On 18 February 2020, Chu et al. reported the full length structure of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 under a 2.9 Å ultracold electron microscope within a compound with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had assembled to form a dimer and that the compound ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to protein S, providing clues to the coronavirus and infection.
The sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for testing drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host.
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and been transmitted to humans via butterflies and camels, respectively.
By comparing the strain evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus matching 96% with two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the host mediator that helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is not yet clear.
G and others have suggested that snakes are carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involves a similar re-synthesis within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that ant-eaters - long-tongued, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity to the coronavirus found in ant-eaters and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across two genomes is still a big difference; and then, we expect conclusive results with the tangible evidence (Figure 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the lab for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days in temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and a humidity of 40 to 50 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to UV and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chloroxide, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and so they are more susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there has been no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to previous studies that relate to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a host virus has invaded, it is recognized by the natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) including type C receptor-like ligand, Toll-like receptor (TLR), nucleotide-binding-particle-scale receptor (NLR), and RIG-I protein-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory factors, branched cell maturation, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large salivary cells for viral antibodies.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the biofilms to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
Helper T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
However, the coronavirus can limit the function of T-cells by inducing programmed T-cell death.
Mixed immunity, including complement proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infection.
For example, I neutralized antibodies isolated from a recovering MERS-CoV patient.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally occurring free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which first appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is impaired to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or 3 to 7 days in most cases, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate care period, thus preventing infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people who are exposed to or infected with the virus are usually asked to undergo a 14-day quarantine.
Should we extend the quarantine to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary symptom of COVID-19, and may be asymptomatic or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or low blood oxygenation one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly developed to have acute respiratory syndrome, infectious trauma, metabolic acid, and cataract.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without undergoing imaging that reveals lung defects, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family and a group that had been infected by someone who had no symptoms.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed respiratory support much more than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with MERS' higher COVID-19 mortality rate.
Diarrhoea (26%) and strep throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it turned out that fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and strep throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and that about 14%-20% of patients needed respiratory support.
By 14 February, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while the confirmed cases were 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, the SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mears, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic survey conducted in June 2012.
An earlier study reported that the basal reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 on a 95% CI range of 5.71 to 7.23, while the basal reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and baseline reproduction number is shown in Table Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
So, controlling SARS-CoV-2 is much more difficult than controlling MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of disease in groups often occurs in the same family or from the same group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of contacting people or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of illness.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alert for increased quarantine time.
Patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, low lymphocytes with 4×109/litre white blood cell count including 1×109/litre lymphocytes, high levels of the transporter aspartate amine and HIV were detected in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver, muscle, and myoglobin enzymes in their blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell mass.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of dimer D, which is caused by the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, rises, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreases.
The X-ray abnormalities appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-blind shadows or a tinted glass seal in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and elevated fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type 1 and type 2 lung cell dysfunction decreases the level of the surface activator and increases the surface tension, and thus, decreases the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst results of a chest X-ray are often compared to the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed lung cell excretion, hyaluronic membrane formation, cellular lymphoproliferation, and multiple cell necrosis in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal DNA by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PTPCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, the use of clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which no longer individually rely on RT-PCR) began in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
So a combination of medical history, clinical features, lab tests, and radiographic findings is essential and fundamental to making an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Chang Group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based Sherlock technique for SARS-CoV-2 detection, detecting pieces of RNA created for SARS-CoV-2 at a rate of 20 × 10-18 mO/L to 200 × 10-18 mO/L (10-100 copies per microl inlet) using immersion in less than an hour without the need for precision devices.
We hope that the new technology can improve sensitivity and fitness significantly if it's tested in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of expertise with respect to the novel coronavirus, doctors are able to provide supportive care primarily to COVID-19 patients while they are trying a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed previously to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
These include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and anti-virus vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs first, and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that release the enzyme that converts angiotensin 2, such as the digestive tract, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure is the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-spasmodic respirators, and spasmodic artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by ECM-OH, a cardiopulmonary embolization technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and infectious trauma, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cytokine storm is known to be caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute cases.
Activating hormones, tosilezomab, and a single-spec antibody to interleukin 6, were used to treat cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm suppressor treatments include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; Janus kinase inhibition; plinatumumab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and histone desitylase inhibitors.
Stimulants and immunosuppressants have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, higher doses of stimulants were not helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially osteovascular necrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis of the disease.
However, the use of short cycles of activated hormones in low to moderate doses has been cautioned for severe COVID-19 cases.
At the time of writing, no anti-virus treatment has been confirmed to be effective.
However, it was found that administering remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, intravenously was effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Gilead has submitted the compound to China to conduct some trials on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being eagerly awaited.
In addition, paresitinib, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/retonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after treatment with the combination of bupinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody generation.
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a disease in preparation for treating other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are anti-AG globulins produced by B cells to fight off pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and target specific molecules in pathogens directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation, viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are still necessary to bring this method to widespread use before specific treatments are developed.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can trigger an over-stimulating immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating patients with critical conditions.
It's difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
So isolating biochemical cells from recovering patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode active antibodies, or testing for active antibodies against the virus's core proteins, is more decisive and practical.
That way, we can easily increase antibody production.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a composition that varies by disease diagnosis based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as it is difficult to extract and verify these ingredients or their optimal compositions.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the important alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in treating COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their patients, including Ganzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very approximate comparison, as many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases must be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Polly Chang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with the combined treatment of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time it took to recover from a high body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms, and the hospital stay was much shorter in the Western medicine plus traditional Chinese medicine treatment group compared to the Western medicine treatment group alone.
Most impressively, the rate of symptom exacerbation (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine treatment group compared to the Western medicine treatment group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine treatment group compared to the Western medicine treatment group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine still awaits further well-studied trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and to explain the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often feel extreme fear of becoming severely contagious and even deadly, and people in quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, infection symptoms such as fever, oxygen deficiency, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia from activated hormones, can lead to further anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first stage of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric disorders have been reported including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor psychosis, psychotic symptoms, delusions, and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory social distancing and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, people in contact with them, and the general public who need it.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct interference with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of the virus from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts are necessary and often complement antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or preventive immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-acting vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for the treatment of SARS.
However, the efficacy of these candidate vaccines in the body of older, lethal challenge models and in preventing them from infection with the source virus has not been determined before a clinical study has been initiated.
That's probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, MERS cases and isolated populations continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in the affected areas.
Immunity strategies against MERS have been developed using inactive virus, deoxygenated RNA plasmids, viral transporters, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of the composite protein, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty presents a challenge due to the long time period (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a novel disease, has just begun to show its full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without punishment.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high rates of disease spread and death in severe cases.
Therefore, building a disease progression prediction model is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the prognosis for SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
The age group of 30 to 65 years was primarily affected by COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not need it (average age 66 vs. 51), indicating age as a predictor of outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Complications and associated diseases: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and irregular heartbeat.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile cells with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly linked and may overlap.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of CRP in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictor of disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
A link between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 and its prognosis has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated levels of the enzyme lactate-hydrogen dissociator (LDH), the amine-aspartate transporter (AST), the enzyme alanine-amine transporter (ALT), and the creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in many organs, particularly the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So, they're the traditional signs of dysfunction in the heart or liver.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest X-rays and the progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of stimulants: As described above, stimulants are commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the widespread use of high-dose activated hormones in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from osteoporosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, low-dose and short-term anabolic steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced extreme stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to reproducing in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, early-stage or in-custody infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were in a severe state of illness, whereas most transmissions of the virus did not occur at an early stage.
So, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are now strenuous efforts in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of nearly all the population in the hope of hindering SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures have hurt the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will continue for between 3 and 4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which seems far more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others created a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-crop and throat scans of patients who had recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may become a recurrent seizure similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, which suggests that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally projected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control through strict quarantine and isolation measures.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in causing infection and eventually goes away or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
The SARS/MERS COVID-19 pandemic is compared below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with virus-infected materials.
The virus was also found in feces, raising a new possibility of transmission from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even passersby who have come into contact with sick or infected people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and respiratory N95 masks (series 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of materials, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small ferrions as much as 10 to 80 nanometers, with only 5% of ferrions enabling full penetration; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and each is approximately 85 nanometers in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks together, health care providers who directly contact patients must wear N95 masks (series number 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must wear appropriate insulation to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands more often with disinfectant soap, try to stay home for self-quarantine and limit contact with individuals who may be infected.
Three feet is a good distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its strong similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 would have caused a state of high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center did not reassure citizens until 19 January 2020 by saying that the new virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human replication and that there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message greatly reduced public alertness, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and a critical time to contain the disease at its lowest in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when releasing public data because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; (4) more proactive in issuing targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of epidemics and periodically testing and improving the community response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
It has spread in less than two months throughout China and about 50 other countries worldwide at the time of this writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger ones and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older adults than in younger ones.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients usually do so when they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A normal SARS-CoV-2 ribosome DNA test can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can contract the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With this rapid progress in COVID-19 research, there are still many critical questions to be addressed, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite finding a 96 percent genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers one and two, we can't stop the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak could come back anytime.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that secrete the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick, accurate diagnosis and offer an effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it passes between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, or will it disappear like SARS, or will it come back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but it may take some time to find answers to the above questions and many others.
However, at whatever cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal origins of the human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the shared evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two types of human coronaviruses were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown the other side to reveal just how dangerous and life-threatening HCV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has re-ignited the spotlight on coronaviruses, and we were surprised by its rapid spread but with a greater disease-causing capacity than its SARS-CoV sibling.
HCoVs are animal-derived diseases, so understanding the animal origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
Intermediate host stores for some HCoVs have also been identified.
Identifying the host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The study of interactions between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides important insight into the origin of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on their discovery history as well as their animal origin and transition between species.
What's important is that we compare and predict different human coronaviruses from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for successful host switching and the impact of viral progression complications on disease severity.
Coronaviruses (Coronaviruses) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of single-stranded positive-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses have the largest genome of any RNA virus at 26 to 32 kilograms of base and are called "crown viruses" because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structural characteristics, coronaviruses contain non-fragmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open-reading motifs (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polypeptide proteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The multiple proteins are further processed to produce 16 non-nuclear proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including the S spike, the E shell, the M membrane, and the N DNA.
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from specific strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (alpha coronaviruses, beta coronaviruses, gamma coronaviruses, and delta coronaviruses), among which the beta coronaviruses that include most human coronaviruses are divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the primary repository for gamma and delta coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have continually broken through species barriers and some have emerged as the cause of serious human disease.
There are seven known human coronaviruses.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, both of which belong to the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five beta coronaviruses include human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds, diarrhea, or both.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infection in more patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (AFS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
It was isolated from human coronavirus-229E, strain one B814, from nasal secretions of flu patients in the mid-1960s.
Much information has since been gathered through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which heal their symptoms automatically.
In fact, it was a generally accepted notion that HCV infection was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the deadliest epidemics in our modern history, with 8,000 cases and an estimated 10 percent deaths.
Ten years later, the updated MERS has spread into a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-2019), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current pandemic, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, or mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, where viruses are well adapted and disease-free but show considerable genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the animal origins of HCoVs has shown a framework for understanding natural history, the driving force and the limiting factors for interspecies migration.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 warehouse, intermediate host and enlarged host animal, with important implications for preventing future fallout.
In this review, we provide an overview of animal origins, transition between species, and human coronaviruses causing disease.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural host but become pathogenic after being transferred between species to a new host.
We also review the human coronavirus pathway where an increase in transmissibility often accompanies a decrease in severity of disease.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from nasal secretions of flu-infected patients, different types of coronaviruses were isolated from a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief history of the human coronavirus discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is intended to be educational and informative.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to live in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients with HCoV-229E experience common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, nausea, sore throat, fever, and cough in approximately 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and was subsequently transmitted in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is not distinguishable by symptoms from infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and nasal viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally, and tend to mostly spread during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of sickness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, infecting healthy individuals with HCoV-229E caused mild colds.
Only a small number of patients with immunodeficiency have shown severe lower respiratory tract injury.
SARS, also known as "Lunatic pneumonia", was the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-transmitter, it is estimated that one case of infection can lead to approximately two second cases, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load on day 10 of illness.
SARS-CoV symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea, and chills, followed by late symptoms of shortness of breath, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Low lymph, dysfunction of the liver, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory malfunctions of SARS.
SARS patients also have widespread renal damage, phytocellular proliferation, and increased salivary cell counts.
About 20-30% of patients then need intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in severe cases many organs can also be affected, including the digestive system, liver, and kidneys, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung scan of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a huge effort has been made to research the human coronavirus.
Human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and HIV patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample of the nose of an eight-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is now widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as whooping cough.
In the same year, human coronavirus-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HKU1 has been reported to be associated with an exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
HKU1 has been found to be globally widespread, causing mild respiratory illness, similar to HKU-63, HKU-229E, and HKU-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and in general the likelihood of mutating to cause diseases with high prevalence rates is low, but the coincidence has occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more aggressive subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when coronaviruses acquire this ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mers-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia from abroad and secondary transmission is rare for contacts in close personal contact.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 resulting in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, and are characterized by an acute, exacerbated pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also suffered from severe renal failure, which distinguishes MERS from other human coronavirus-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal infectious symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
During mid- to late December 2019, groups of pneumonia patients later identified as SARS-CoV-2 were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory infection due to SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern, as it has been called COVID-19.
On 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial death rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in Hubei province of China is 4.2%, while it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also occurs in some people.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homogeneity in nucleotide sequences of 82%, they belong to different branches of the evolutionary tree of the lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Some people have been reported to be asymptomatic despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and these may be contributing to its rapid spread worldwide.
A comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six HCoVs revealed significant similarities and differences.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in incubation and the time period of illness.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 infection symptoms is among SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits traits that are more common in community-acquired HCoV infections, including the appearance of unspecified or mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in SARS-CoV, although the rate is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns in both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples as in other human coronaviruses.
More studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether oral-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays as important a role as SARS-CoV in at least some cases.
It is interesting whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal spread as in community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including the potential for transmission, pathogenesis mechanism and sustained spread after human transmission, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired human coronaviruses that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
There's another perspective, which may also be true, that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, they may both be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that infect humans with acute diseases have been eliminated as well as humans infected with acute HCoVs.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans enough to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the host's limiting factors.
And from this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance it's fully adapted to humans.
If it adapts well, it's hard to stop it from spreading to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses spread among human populations over many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses don't need a zoo.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs, which cause severe human-to-human interactions, did not adapt well, and they could not continue to spread between humans.
They need to stay in their animal enclosures and breed there and then look for the right opportunity to move to more vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It's as contagious as community-acquired human coronaviruses, at least for now.
However, it causes more disease than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be helpful to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, storage, intermediate, and amplified hosts of HCoVs.
An animal is an evolutionary host for HCoVs if it harbours a closely related parent virus and shares a large nucleotide sequence homology.
The original virus is usually well-adapted and does not cause infection to this host.
Similarly, the host warehouse hosts the human coronavirus continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the human coronavirus enters the host medium recently before or near its invasion of humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes disability.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also performs the role of amplifier host by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and thus transmit to humans to spread the spread of infection among humans.
HCoV infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to an intermediate host and may even colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first SARS case had a history of contact with the parrots.
Subsequent pre-exposure surveys indicated that animal dealers had higher rates of SARS-CoV IgG prevalence compared to normal people.
The Paguma larvata and the raccoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This is indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS have been reported after all the zebra cats in the markets have been killed.
However, the SARS-CoV test result in masked palm fronds living in the wild or farmed without exposure to live animal markets was reported to be largely negative, suggesting that masked palm fronds may be only a moderate macro-host, but not the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
Noting that while 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also play the role of an amplified mediator host for SARS-CoV is not excluded.
It seems that all of these are hosts that do not transmit SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the detection of a closely related bat coronavirus, called HKU3 (HKU3 Chinese Yellow Horse Snout Bat Virus), which is found in Chinese Horse Snout Bats.
The SARS-CoV antibody test in these bats and the sequence of the HKU3 gene for the HKU3 virus were positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none can be isolated as a live virus except WIV1.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 extracted from a bat stool sample was shown to use the converted enzyme angiotensin 2 in bats, butterflies, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serum of recovering patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome was able to equate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the most closely related SARS-CoV-1 strain in bats, sharing 95% of the same nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct repository host for SARS-CoV.
The evolution analysis of the MERS-CoV strains in the bat group of the HKU4 coronavirus and the HKU5 coronavirus in the bat itself combines.
The HKU4 coronavirus in bats and the future MERS-CoV uses the same host, bipeptide peptide4, to enter the virus.
The Mers-Koeff DNA-based RNA polymerization sequences are more closely related in strain evolution to its counterparts in bat-coronavirus beta-virus identified in Europe and Africa.
Merse-Cove has not yet been discovered to live in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and HKU25 coronavirus share in the closest bats only 87% of the nucleotide sequence similarity.
So, bats may not be the direct host warehouse of Mers-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that only the snail camel is positive for serum of MERS-CoV antibodies, and camels of Middle Eastern origin are also found in many African countries.
A live Mers-Kopf neighborhood matching the virus found in humans was isolated from nasal swabs of the monosperm camel, suggesting that the camel serves as the original Mers-Kopf repository host.
It is also worth noting that mild symptoms generally appeared in Jamal who was experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but a heavy viral spread was observed.
The infected beavers were spreading the viruses remarkably well, not only by breathing but also through the oral anus, which is the primary route of the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with the camel before symptoms appear, and these cases have been logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown modes of transmission involving unidentified animal species in MERS-CoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RaTG13 in horseshoe-tailed bats is associated with 96.2% nucleotide homology.
The sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine a relationship to the father, as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
This means that bats may not be the direct host/hostess of SARS-CoV-2 unless near-matching bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Wuhan seafood market, with which many early cases of COVID-19 have been associated, suggesting the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as the fire ant-eater (Manis javanica) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2-associated beta coronaviruses.
The genomes of this ant-eating new coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share 85-92% of the same nucleotide sequences.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
Two sub-strains of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are grouped in the strain evolution tree, one of which shares a similar forward binding domain with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence matching.
In stark contrast, the binding regions of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors differ significantly from those of RaTG13, although the overall genome sequence is more similar.
A previous study on a sick eater of a sick hornet also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, and they were similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used various assembly and manual processing methods to generate a partial genome sequence that is made up of the entire viral genome by approximately 86.3% of its length.
We can't rule out the possibility that the ant-eater is one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that ant-eating was the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta coronaviruses in ant-eating ants.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta coronaviruses in the bite of the ant-eater.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, ant-eaters, and other mammals is still being determined.
While the highest sequence similarity in receptor binding domains was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the ant-eater, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-associated beta coronaviruses share the highest sequence similarity for the whole genome.
It is a prevailing speculation that the high degree of similarity between the binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in beta-coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 selectively adaptive ant-eater is evolutionarily approximate.
There is a proposed recombination between SARS-CoV-2 in the bite of the beta-coronaviruses and RaTG13 in the wild species III.
Re-composition is widespread among beta coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence of lineage evolution has suggested that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Highlands Coronavirus) detected in North American tricolored bats has been reported to be closely related to human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was found to be genetically related to another bat-coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and was suspected to be also mediated by the host.
For illustration, current information on the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Analysis of strain evolution provided evidence for human coronavirus transmissions between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus-OC43 species passed to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory tract infection was recorded.
The history of human-coronavirus-229E transmission between species is still less clear.
Alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be closely related to human coronaviruses 229E.
Among them is the alpha coronavirus in Alpaca.
There's plenty of evidence to support the virus' direct transmission from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a common habitat.
While humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the human coronavirus-229E belonging to the bat coronaviruses alpha is polyvalent and disease-causing in bats, while the alpaca coronavirus alpha causes outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha corona virus associated with alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas may have been infected with human coronavirus-229E belonging to human coronavirus alpha cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause disease in humans, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
So it's not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
While alpha coronaviruses in bats act as the assembler of the HCoV-229E genes, alpacas and unicorns may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as is the case in MERS-CoV.
Meers-Kowf provides an excellent example of transition between species, moving from bats to unicorns and from unicorns to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mers-Couf from bats has been known since its early identification and has also been confirmed by later results.
It's clear that bats provide a rich collection of virus species for the exchange of genetic bits within a species and their transfer between species.
Bats are long-lived, live in crowded colonies, have close social interactions, and have strong flight abilities, all of which make them ideal "virus spreaders".
Mears-Cove, on the other hand, has moved to the only beauty of the swan over decades.
It may adapt to this beauty well enough to transform from an intermediate host to a natural, stable warehouse host.
Mers-Couf causes very mild disease and keeps the mutation rate relatively low in these animals.
Its intermittent transmission to humans remains by chance and humans are a non-transmitter host for MERS-CoVs where its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the ant-eater, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, the beta coronaviruses associated with the eating of the ant-swallow make it very sick.
They may be non-transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 of the beta coronaviruses, much like the butter cat in SARS-CoV.
Future studies will determine many possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans by either confirming or excluding it.
First, bats may be a host-depository for a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, which is most likely identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share a habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the ant-eater may be one of the intermediate enlarger hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
Humans get the virus by slaughtering and eating the meat of prey.
It's likely that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There's a reason to run antibody tests on pets and wildlife.
Third, as mentioned above, COV-2 may have been reassembled and adapted into a third type that has contact with bats and scavenger ants.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three main factors that are also important in making it easier for coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, mutation rates are relatively high in the replication of ribosome DNA.
Estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses, compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average rate of conversion of ~10-4 cases per year for site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronaviruses to new hosts.
Coronaviruses contain an exogenously corrective ribonuclease enzyme, which causes it to be deleted with very high mutability and degradation or inability to evolve.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known for its ability to inhibit the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting the enzyme exogenous ribonuclease and ribosome-based DNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is a precursor agent for SARS-CoV-2 and is being tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of coronavirus mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of host viruses.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt properly to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower when compared to SARS-CoV-2 with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems to have already adapted to another host close to human.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to the single-celled camel.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will help vaccines and antiviral drugs to resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the giant ribosome DNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional donut in genome editing for mutation and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which favors the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become favorable.
This is supported by the unique abundant open reading templates and protein functions encoded near the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly change patterns during replication of ribosome DNA through a unique "replication selection" mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixing bowl, sequencing occurs repeatedly during replication of the RNA of the coronavirus.
High-symmetry full-length and secondary ribosome DNA may reassemble to produce new coronaviruses.
Evidence of evolutionary recombination strains has been found in human coronavirus-HKU1 and human coronavirus-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in bats and HKU9 in bats.
The virus interacts with the host associated with the transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host host is another major factor influencing transmissions between species.
In this regard, we take the SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which has also shown evidence for positive selection during transitional events between species.
Based on comparative analysis of isolated SARS-CoV samples in humans and butterflies, it was thought that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the S-protein receptor binding domain.
In general, the binding domain of the S-protein receptor for coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensively selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the binding domain of the amino acid receptors 318 to 510 occurs in the S1 region, which binds to the angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme in addition to the helper receptors for virus entry.
The receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV-2 is able to identify the fates of the enzyme that converts angiotensin 2 to help in various animals, including bats, zebras, mice, and raccoons, which allows the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were identified that were different from isolated human and butterfly viral samples in the receptor binding domain, and four of them are found in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2.
The K479N and S487T mutations are present in the Sars-CoV receptor binding domain in butterflies, which could increase the likelihood of spike protein interaction in the future of the human angiotensin-2 transforming enzyme.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be of crucial importance for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in the S1 unit of S protein, implicitly indicating that the S protein binding probability in the human angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme has changed.
Indeed, a study with the ultracold electron microscope indicated that there was a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this binding than what happens between the human angiotensin-2 transducer enzyme and the S protein in SARS-CoV.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receiver may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is also interesting that human coronavirus-NL63 also binds to angiotensin-2 transducer but in a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCoVs, such as the N-protein analyte for HCoV-229E, and the 9-O-associated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transitioning between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also subject to other host-dependence and host-restrictive factors.
The diffusion of these host proteins between humans and the hosts of natural repositories of coronaviruses, such as bats, sloths, and rodents, could be an obstacle to transmissions between species.
HCoVs need to control host-dependent factors and weaken their restriction factors to carry out successful transmissions between species.
In this respect, the molecular determinants in this critical space for the virus' interaction with the host remain detectable and characterizing.
Extensive, unbiased genome-wide screening can be used to look for reliable factors and host limitations for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new human coronaviruses: back to square one
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats presents ample opportunities for emerging human coronaviruses.
And from this logic, bat coronaviruses are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and recombination also drive the evolution of the human coronavirus, and they are two important points in this process.
For example, acquiring or losing recovered protein coding genes involves the ability to modify viral phenotypes to a great extent.
Among the regulatory proteins for SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoVs associated with viruses were isolated in bats but found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
The 29 nucleotide deletion properties of SARS-CoV were found to be present in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion led to ORF8 being split into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination by the alpha and gamma coronaviruses, with a large number of small recombination regions identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Reassembly sites in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14 have also been identified.
Similarly, research has shown that the Mers-Coeuf epidemic has seen cases of cross-breeding, which occurred in the only snow leopard in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination cases have also been documented in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have combined with other animal coronaviruses in their own non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also aid in unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from the release of viruses from selective stresses, such as those produced by the host's immune system.
The loss of the full length ORF4 protein in the HCoV-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although normal ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses related to HCoV-229E, albic coronaviruses show alpha-infecting single nucleotide sutures, which leads to a castration frame mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their warehouse hosts.
Only mild or asymptomatic cases have been detected when bats have been infected with coronaviruses, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats are adequately adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, weak activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduced the pathogens caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to increased rate of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and decreased expression of the class I major tissue-compatibility molecule.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (RCOs) resulting from high bat metabolic activity can lead to both inhibition of the replication of the coronavirus and effect on correction by the exogenous ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the development of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in host hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate aggressively without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Herein lie the secrets of why we see asymptomatic carriers of the virus and why acute cases of human infection occur.
The acute symptoms were mainly caused by an over-active immune response and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is detached from the replication of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy for immune response isolation may have beneficial effects in anti-COV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, intake of type I interferon may be of benefit at least in the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, activation of the inflammatory particle cryopyrin NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this logic, inhibiting the inflammatory particle cryopyrin NLRP3 with the inhibitor MCC950 is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-coronavirus in bats was found to share SARS-CoV-95% nucleotide homology, there was also bat-coronavirus sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While butterflies and other animals in markets have been found to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, they have not detected direct hosts intermediate for SARS-CoV-2.
Beta coronaviruses have been detected in ant-eaters that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that ant-eaters may be an intermediate host or that beta coronaviruses in ant-eaters may have contributed to genetic cuts that led to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was man-made, either intentionally or by accident.
The coronavirus has returned to the spotlight with the start of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our thinking about the importance of animal-derived disease origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The conclusive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 all originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from human-pet cat contact at markets, closing fresh produce markets and killing pet cats was supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the same mindset, the ant-eater should be eliminated from fresh produce markets to prevent the transmission of animal-derived disease, given the discovery of multiple strains of beta coronaviruses in ant-eater that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans or not, and regardless of how it is transmitted, via ant-eaters and other mammals remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
Mears-Cove, on the other hand, has been found in the beauty of the swan for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local population.
It is widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it's impossible to sacrifice all the beauty to control MERS, as officials at China's wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in addition to other infection control measures.
If we can't eliminate these viruses completely, new genetic patterns may emerge and cause outbreaks.
There are a variety of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases originating in wildlife.
In particular, the coronavirus in bats is highly diverse, implying the potential for animal-derived disease.
There are many opportunities for animal-derived coronaviruses to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future.
The wildlife eating culture should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the distress that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 have brought to mankind, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact is that many viruses have been taking their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their natural reservoirs until they have a chance to spread and reproduce.
Although bats have many characteristics that tend to spread viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that requires them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary procedure to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which has proven useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-borne viral diseases is to keep humans away from the natural habitat of animal-borne viruses.
The mystery of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains surrounded by many questions that require answers.
First, if bats transmit the original SARS-CoV-2 virus to an ant-eater, it's important to know the conditions that set the stage for the bat and ant-eater to share the same environment.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to humans, then the way humans interact with them should be determined.
Third, if a third species of mammal is the true mediator host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and ant-eaters.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether the host is a bat, an ant-eater, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or the parent viruses from which it is derived are expected to be identified and will be nearly identical in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with what it entails as important measures for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The need to update the "suspect" and "confirmed" criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19
Our team published a quick guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus 2019 (NCoV-2019) on 6 February 2020. This guidance provides our experience and includes relevant reference information for the global pandemic response.
Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspect" and "confirmed" according to the latest guidance on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (novel coronavirus 2019), now officially known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), broke out and the virus was named SARS-CoV-2.
On 11 March 2020, the WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has drafted a quick guideline and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It's received a lot of attention since it was published.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn) has issued COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines, between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, with a total of seven versions with some contexts substantially changed.
Now, our guidance has been met with a comment from Cho and others, who have suggested a simple clinical-based score monitoring.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance and have also become a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We applaud their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (Pilot Version VII) and recent studies.
According to the seventh release (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspected case needs to combine any of the features of the epidemiological history and two elements of clinical manifestations to arrive at a comprehensive analysis, or needs to verify three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemic history: (1) a date including travel to, or residence in, Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities reported to have had COVID-19 cases, within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a date including contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive DNA test results); (3) a date including contact with fever or respiratory symptoms patients from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities reported to have had COVID-19 cases within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a date of contact with infectious agents (2 or more infections, such as smallpox, or other illnesses) that occurred in a school, office, or other small-scale area; or
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics that are established by imaging for COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a normal, low, or low total white blood cell count from lymphatic count at the early stage of infection.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on the suspected case involving any of the following elements of evidence of pathogenicity or serum interactions: (1) positive for real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2; (2) high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics; (3) positive serum IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2; or the IgG for SARS-CoV-2 has changed from negative to positive, or the recovery phase is at or above 4 times that level.
We see that the real-time DNA polymerase chain reaction test in respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogen detection in blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the blood serum interaction guide was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications have relied on the ongoing work of researchers to design an ideal suite of DNA-based detection tools for rapid diagnosis, plus respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples, and supported the transfer of a positive antigen score to established case criteria.
Besides, there is growing evidence that we should be careful when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and non-symptomatic conditions.
So, the content of the information flow chart for Cho and others, where they classified a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk", should be updated.
The scores monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to have access to more direct evidence and invite readers to provide their comments.
To diagnose "suspect" and "confirmed" cases, we encourage you to follow and abide by the latest guidance from your home country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh has recorded five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily rate.
Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths yesterday.
That's the highest number of deaths in one day from the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, the number of registered cases was 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases were residing at home.
There have been 17 deaths.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadie Sabrina Flora, said in an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases over the age of 60, two cases between the ages of 51 and 60, and one case between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Authority, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Abid al-Qadir, said in a video statement online on Saturday that public transport will be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The disruption of public transportation initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Basic goods, such as medical products, fuel and food, are still allowed to be transported.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on March 8, in two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
All three were already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has exceeded one million worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This serious development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus cases, and the first death linked to it was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced 1051635 confirmed cases, as of yesterday, of which 79332 cases occurred in the 24 hours leading up to 10am CET (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths associated with the virus.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday from coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Mr. Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, announced on Thursday that the city's lockdown had been extended until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that salaries will continue to be paid to Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to all day, where it was previously only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor, Mr. Mike D. Wayne, has announced that the state has extended the curfew until May 1.
Australia 's stores are lowering their toilet paper limits per transaction .
Australian department store chains Wallworths and Coles on Saturday and Sunday evening tightened restrictions on toilet paper purchases to reduce them to two rolls from Wallworths and one roll from Coles per transaction at all branches nationwide.
I also set up Aldi's stores for one bubble, and that was on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at checkout points in chain stores and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have been suggesting that they be stored due to concerns about COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
Wallworths on Wednesday passed restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes to one wrapper per purchase order.
These changes come after previous restrictions imposed by Wal-Whirth on March 4 and Cools on March 5 allowing only four envelopes per transaction.
Coles stores reported in its March 8 press release that despite the four-wrap restrictions, "many stores still sell all they have within one hour of receipt", and described the order as "unprecedented", as did Aldi stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as "unpredictable".
Sales have "significantly increased" in the past week, according to a spokesman for Wal-Worth stores.
Costco in Canberra also set the limit last week at two waffles.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased delivery rates, and Wal-Worth stores ordered additional inventory, while Aldi stores opened their inventory for specials scheduled for early Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the delivery time of trucks are making it difficult.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with limited special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi stores announced that due to early stock availability, some stores will not be able to offer Wednesday specials.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, reported in a report for News.com.au that stores are filling up every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, which leads to a decrease in inventory in terms of numbers, and when it is sold out, it leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which reinforces the feeling of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman, as reported by ABC News, stated: "Cools and Wallworths have a view [that] if there are more goods on the shelves, and if products like toilet paper and sterilizers can be [purchased] and stored in bulk, that might reduce panic".
Who Gives a Crap, a company that produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that its stock was out.
According to a report on News.com.au, Kemperly-Clark, which makes Clinix toilet paper, and Solaris Pepper, which makes Sorbent, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue supplying their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of the N.T. News, a Darwin daily, included an eight-page folded advertisement made so that it could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially hesitant about restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, with stores saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including vacuums, sterilizers, dry goods, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okado was listing its purchases of Andres toilet paper in two 12-wrap bottles.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic .
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, has reached pandemic levels.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the disease, not the severity of specific cases, the WHO has warned that governments should be urged to take the necessary measures:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "If countries detect and screen people, treat them, isolate them, track their cases and mobilize for confrontation".
"We are all very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and danger as well as the levels of inaction that warn of danger".
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said, "No other respiratory virus has been traced from its initial appearance to its ongoing global spread, other than influenza".
Gebreussus expressed a similar view, saying: "We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"We've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new situation is being described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "The bottom line is that things are going to get worse".
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for the virus.
The primary treatment is supportive treatment and for symptoms. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, monitoring, and self-isolation of those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures.
The pandemic led to severe global social and economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus spread online, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people, and other areas with high cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan City (capital of Hubei Province), China reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and began investigating in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronaviruses, the ant-eater coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person with symptoms was infected on 1 December 2019, and this person had no apparent contact with the wet market group that was later discovered.
Among the early batch of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning Post indicated that a case dated 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, may have been the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases reported in China were down, they rose sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases within for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of Britons needed to be infected before effective herd immunisation could be undertaken.
Cases indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed as infected according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have official policies not to test for those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases remained undetected in China, as of January 23, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
Statistical analysis estimates published on 30 March indicated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the period from symptom deterioration to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 has caused approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China since 5 February have been in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics for deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died with confirmed COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested - for example, at home, in a nursing home, and so on.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "we know that [the number of deaths reported] reflects a lower estimate than the reality", a statement supported by narrative reports suggesting the inaccuracy of the census in the US. Such a lack of estimates occurs in epidemics; such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in both Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, and the time it has taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health. The ratio of deaths to infections reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of deaths from infections have fallen from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures refer to the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those infected who died from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those infected (confirmed and unconfirmed) who die from the disease.
These statistics have no time frame and follow a specific population from infection to knowledge of the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Centre estimates that the overall mortality rate from the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate for this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on estimates of case mortality.
The WHO is confirming that the pandemic is under control.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massage Bonny of Pennsylvania State University states: "Undetected outbreaks of infectious disease usually peak and then begin to decline when the disease finds no available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to come up with any reasonable prediction right now about when that will be".
The Chinese government's top medical adviser, Chung Nanchan, said that "it could be over by June" if all countries can be motivated to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 "will be widespread for perhaps a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College London under the supervision of scientist Neil Ferguson, we will have to rely on physical distancing and other measures "until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will go away completely because it's so easily transmitted", and it could "become a seasonal disease that comes back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific and may not show symptoms in those infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, discharge of respiratory mucus (pelum), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or jaundice. The World Health Organization confirms that almost one in six people suffer from severe illness and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bruising of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur.
Some people who are infected, who do not have clinical symptoms but whose test results confirm their infection, may not show symptoms, so experts have advised that people who have been exposed to confirmed cases should be monitored and closely screened to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44 percent.
The typical incubation period (the period between infection and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; often five days. As an example of the case of confusion, the estimated proportion of COVID-19 patients who initially lost their sense of smell was 30% and has recently fallen to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being researched.
It is thought to spread mainly during mixing or by spray dispersal when coughing, sneezing or talking; this is when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth can cause a spray that spreads from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe that the virus may also be transmitted by long-term airborne spray, which may be produced during speech. It may also produce respiratory spray during the process of vomiting, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally transmitted through the air.
The spray may fall on the mouth or nose of people nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubal and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray and then cause airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spread from feces to the mouth, that risk is thought to be limited.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from feces to the mouth. The virus is most infectious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been confirmed to have the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that it may be transmitted before severe symptoms appear.
There are few reports of lab-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contaminant tracking surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease can spread, one person can generally infect two to three others. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found to be detectable for up to three days on polypropylene and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals, as well as other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus, first isolated from three people with mixed pneumonia in a group of cases of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its characteristics with naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, dissolving its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thought to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically interbred with the beta coronavirus genus, and falls under the subgenus of the SARS-CoV-2 (B strain) plus two strains of bat origin.
It 's a 96% genome-wide match to other bat samples of the coronavirus , Pat Coff Rat G13 .
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between the ant-eating viruses of the ant-eating ant and the viruses of the human.
Comparisons of the entire genome so far have found a maximum of 92% genetic similarity between ant-eating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that ant-eating is the mediator of this virus.
A diagnosis of viral infection can be made temporarily based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing the interaction of polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography indicated that computed tomography is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interacting with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends "not to use CT imaging for detection of COVID-19 or as a preliminary screening for diagnosis".
The World Health Organization published several protocols for SARS-CoV-2 ribosome DNA testing, for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the reaction of the polymerase chain reverse transcription (RT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on samples from the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done by a nasal swab, and a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing oral tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them have been sufficiently accurate to be widely adopted.
The MOSFET test developed by Silex has been approved for emergency use in the United States only in approved laboratories.
The imaging characteristics of X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical edema such as blurred glass and distorted crystal bulges.
The Italian Radiation Society compiles an international online database of imaging results of confirmed cases.
Radiography without polymerase chain reaction is a limited accuracy method for detecting COVID-19 because of its interaction with other diseases such as GV infections.
A large study in China compared CT scans of the chest with polymerase chain reaction and proved that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of infection detection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it as a screening tool in infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based spin neural networks have been developed to detect the properties of virus imaging in both X-ray and CT imaging.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and then disposing of it directly in the trash bin.
We recommend that those who are already infected wear a medical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned or advised against non-essential travel from and to affected countries and regions.
Yet, the virus has reached the point of community-wide spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers, who care for someone who is at risk of infection, are advised to use appropriate precautions, contact precautions and eye protection.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been designed or discarded for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked to find privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. It promotes misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and mouthwashing is not a viable solution.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, although many organizations are working to produce a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when they have hand rust, before eating, and after emptying their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
That's because household soap kills the virus outside the body, where it destroys its protective membrane.
The CDC also recommends using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected using several detergents (within one minute of applying the disinfectant to the stainless steel surface), including; 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% iodophedon.
Other detergents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that when someone is suspected or confirmed to have COVID in an establishment such as an office or care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, and common electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either by bending their elbows and placing them in front of their mouth and nose or by using a paper towel and getting rid of any towels immediately.
It is recommended that those at risk wear medical masks, as wearing masks reduces the volume of respiratory spray and the distance it travels when it is spread due to talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce [people's] desire to touch their face, which is a major source of infection if they do not wash their hands properly". Caregivers of people who are at risk of contracting the disease are recommended to wear masks.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people should not wear masks unless they are at high risk, such as those caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a non-medical cloth face mask. China specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially in direct contact with people (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going out in public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has required train and intercity bus passengers to wear masks on April 1.
Panama made wearing a face mask when outdoors mandatory, with the manufacture of face masks at home also recommended for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures that aim to slow the spread of disease by minimizing mixing between individuals.
Roads include quarantine; restrictions on travel; closing schools, workplaces, sports arenas, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are currently imposing or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 spread was detected in the area) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and weakened immune systems face an increased risk of serious illness and complications and the CDC has advised them to stay at home as much as possible in areas of disease outbreak among communities. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health bodies began replacing the term "social distancing" with the term "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce contact with the vertebrate body, maintain social connections, or presume social distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" has suggested that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations not to have sex unless you live with someone who is not infected or has symptoms.
Home self-isolation is recommended for those with COVID-19 and those suspected of having it.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those in the most vulnerable categories.
Those who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days before their next possible exposure.
Strategies to control the outbreak are containment or containment and limiting the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and is intended to track and isolate those infected as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease becomes impossible to contain, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be carried out at the same time.
Curbing requires more stringent measures to reverse the course of the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction number to less than 1. A part of infectious disease outbreak management is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, in what is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of stress for health services and saves more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical interventions that may treat the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. More stringent measures aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as the imposition of medical quarantine on entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and local quarantine, and issued warnings about the movements of the infected.
Singapore provided financial support to those who isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has been depleting medical supplies. Simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic, not stopping it) and containment (reversing the growth of the epidemic) are facing significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress on health systems.
Containment may be preferred but should be maintained as long as the virus is spreading in humans (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that happens first), as transmission, on the other hand, reverses rapidly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to curb the pandemic have social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" could provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare facilities to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the WHO as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating elective procedures where possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of artificial respirators and available beds.
There are multiple theories about where the first case originated (called Patient 0).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly related to the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animal species; in other words, it has an animal origin. A group with pneumonia for an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported the Jianghan Bohuan Disease Control Center on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were alerted by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Wen, was reprimanded by her superiors for sounding the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to Wuhan health authorities that prompted them to start investigating in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, with the help of transportation during Chinese New Year and to Kun and Wuhan, a transportation hub and major railway junction.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data released later shows that 6,174 people already had symptoms by January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, there were reportedly over 1.61 million cases worldwide, with over 97,000 people dead and over 364,000 people recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, or shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people were under lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people were under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were under lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some form of lockdown, a number that rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian noticed a group of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, and reported to her hospital the Jianghan Wuhan Disease Control Center on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In the wake of these alerts, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of transmission from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a sweeping campaign that Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping later described as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a travel ban from and to Wuhan was announced on January 23, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicles are prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshensan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, Lichenshan Hospital, to handle the extra patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health notices to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
Hong Kong and Macau have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been imposed on both in and out of Hobby.
Public transportation has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed across China.
Public movement has been curbed in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of curfew. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "brought" to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries. On 23 March, one case was locally transmitted in mainland China during the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese State Council President Li Keqiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections and the control of the outbreak in China had decreased.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, except for Wuhan, after two months of lockdown. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at the Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to resume work on March 30, and offered a set of monetary incentives for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning with a three-minute silence on April 4 at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to show their respect online in keeping with physical distancing to avoid a further outbreak of COVID-19.
COVID-19 transmission from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to the gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
It is suspected that Shincheonji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan are the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people, or about 13% of the 9,336 churchgoers, reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest alert levels on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been placed under quarantine after tests confirmed three soldiers infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented what was considered the largest and best-regulated program in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected, and track down those who had been infected and quarantine them.
Testing methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile app, testing of people inside their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program represents a success in controlling the outbreak despite not enforcing quarantines on entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for Moon's removal, alleging the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that starting April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test the virus.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, with two people dying later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit inter-city travel were announced in March, despite heavy traffic continuing between cities before the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Qum remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became a center of the virus' spread after China during February.
Amid allegations of Iran's cover-up of the outbreak, more than a dozen countries have tracked their cases coming in from Iran since February 28, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak may exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
The Iranian parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly infected with the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to also temporarily release eligible prisoners.

At least 12 Iranian politicians and former government officials have died from the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran was recording 50 new cases per hour, and one death every 10 minutes from the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be up to five times the number reported.
It is also believed that US sanctions on Iran may affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on 31 January, when SARS-CoV-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome came back positive.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated batch of COVID-19 cases were later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree on a new law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "He will not be allowed to enter or leave the outbreak areas.

As of 5 April, 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 cases have been reported in Italy, most of them in the Lombardy region.
The CNN report noted that the combination of a large number of older adults and the inability to test all those infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the higher death rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or widespread quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its notable lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising to avoid unnecessary travel or social interaction, suggesting people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all leisure establishments such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages to a maximum of £2,500 per month to reduce unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, with gatherings of more than two people banned and travel and activity outside the home restricted except for strict necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through the issuance of fines and the dispersal of gatherings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for "essential" commercial projects, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and garages.

Despite doing so, the United States slowed the test launch, obscuring the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test spoiled a defective test kit produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental test kits (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was required after that).

On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gooden Gallia noted that while this was "certainly not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is heavily concentrated", and described it as "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after confirmation of transmission from person to person outside China, and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth public health emergency of international concern since the first time this outbreak was reported during the 2009 outbreak.
The WHO Director-General said the outbreak is an international public health emergency of concern because of "the risk of global spread, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that do not have robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily conflict with international travel and trade" and that "the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and mobility".
On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds set up in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have systems to detect people with the virus, even if it does emerge".

This virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared for it", he urged to take the right response measures that can help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "we are basically accepting that every person on the planet will be exposed to this virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO "is deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and alarming levels of inaction".

Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have refused to acknowledge earlier that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories alleged by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The US administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or a "Wuhan virus", saying that China "imposed a blackout on news that has exacerbated the virus that is now a global pandemic", which has been criticized by some critics as racist "and distracted from his administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a US government cable reviewing the communications scheme by clear sources at the National Security Council, stating strategically that "everything is about China.

The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament as well as fifteen other former or current political figures infected.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, saying his country was struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal childcare, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predict that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined at designated government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's removal because they claimed the government had mismanaged the outbreak or praised his response. The pandemic allowed states to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this could allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree for an indefinite period, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supply shortages.
Many areas also saw panic buying, which led to shelves being empty of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing shortages.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delayed shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment could double by 100 times.
This demand has led to prices rising up to 20 times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for between four and six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for Diago shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, both regions survived severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the storage and illicit trade of biological products have successfully avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant drop, but prices may rise according to industry representatives' expectations.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by measures taken by the government to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, the outbreak of the virus has been seen to pose a major, destabilizing threat to global economic stability.
Agatha Demaris of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture of the possible outcomes emerged.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the global supply chain has been affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly experienced a "disruption" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indexes, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard & Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, its biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
The three indices ended the week down by more than 10%.
On February 28, Scop Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative forecasts.
Stocks fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall being on March 16.
Many believe that a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed Al-Arian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and states in a timely manner.
Central banks are responding faster than they were in the wake of the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and travel warnings from governments around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Quantas, while the British regional airline, FlyBee, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The pandemic coincided with the Spring Festival travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments canceled a number of events with large crowds, including New Year's celebrations, with private companies also shutting down their stores independently and attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple exhibits.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions in China, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and issued instructions to most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the infectious disease response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations. The retail sector globally was affected by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a drop of between 50 and 60 percent.
This also led to a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been the case without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's roughly 300 million rural migrant workers are trapped in their homes in the interior provinces, or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed. The survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers on government-backed short-term work plans known as Kurzarbet.
France and Britain adopted the German short-term work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organisations as well as individuals - both employed and self-employed - globally.
Arts and culture sector institutions sought to support their (often government-funded) mission of providing access to the cultural heritage of the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and supporting artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, around the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent accelerating repercussions of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian season of penance in Lent.
Many Christian parishes have recommended that older people stay home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rome closing its churches and cathedral, and clearing St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited services and public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, synagogues, and gurdaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and subsequently closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as its residents from entering the holy places in Mecca and Madinah.
This pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the global mathematical calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, 2020 UEFA Europa League, 2019-20 AHL season, and 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would "be rescheduled to after 2020 but no later than summer 2021". Gambling clubs and other venues around the world were closed and live gambling tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This led to many gamblers moving to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with various bands suspended or concert tours cancelled.
Many large theaters like the one on Broadway suspended all shows as well.
Some artists have found ways to continue producing and sharing their work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live concerts or creating online "celebrations" for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
Many internet memes about the coronavirus have spread online, with many turning into humor and entertainment amidst the uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world towards the Chinese as deserving of the virus or receiving what was supposedly justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in the affected areas.
After the outbreak in new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to witness a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may be exposed to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan is #Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and the US have reported increasing levels of racial abuse, as well as assault.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term that critics have deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, who study in major Indian cities have faced harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak.
BJP chief in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata later condemned these statements, calling them "erroneous". In China, the pandemic led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being labeled as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "dump".
Many newspapers have removed paid subscription pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers about the outbreak available to the public.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their findings on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus where it identifies antibodies that produce a response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the ribosome DNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal DNA.
Used to confirm very recent or active cases of injury.
Antibody detection (vascular science) is used for diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who showed no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is considerable variation in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This variation is also likely to have a significant impact on reported death rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
The use of instantaneous sequential polymerase reaction for reverse transcription (RT-PCR) can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasal mucus or a plum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR performed with throat scans is only reliable in the first week of illness.
The virus may then disappear from the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are screened in the second week, a sample of the deep airways can instead be taken by suction catheter or cough suppressant (plum).
One of the early PCR tests was created in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the reaction of reverse transcription momentary-serial polymerase (RT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also developed a PCR-based, safe, clinical-use PowerChek Coronavirus detection device for SARS-CoV-2 on 28 January 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection equipment. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its own 2019 novel coronavirus (NCoV-2019) diagnostic board based on instantaneous RT-PCR to public health laboratories through the International Detection Materials Provider.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to defective detectors, and one phase of testing was delayed from others at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in the successful completion of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not reliable until February 28, 2020, and even then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The FDA approved the test under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting tests in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that it was making COVID-19 testing available nationwide based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions are announced; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research developed and produced the Victor COVID-19 test.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health Care Supervision Service (FHSM) registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic developed a test for detecting COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests over 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA previously granted similar authorization to Holographic, Lab Corp. and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sevid received a similar emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for a test that lasts about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using thermal DNA amplification instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test using a single-line antibody that specifically binds to the nuclear envelope protein (Protein N) of the new coronavirus, in the hope that it will be able to deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "chest X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results may be clear even before symptoms appear".
Common features seen in CT include multi-lobed bi-sided tempered glass seals with a perimeter, asymmetrical, and backward distribution.
Spread under the forehead, irregular patches appear and intensify as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT imaging regarding the origin of the current epidemic indicated that CT imaging is more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interacting with pneumonia and other stages of disease.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiography recommends "not using computed tomography for detection of COVID-19 or as a preliminary screening for diagnosis of the disease". In March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for preliminary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection of individuals within a period of 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immunity, and in case of population surveillance. Analysis can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care (POCT) testing.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but how much they can do will depend on the output rate of each system.
For central laboratories, one sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although sequential samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For point-of-care testing, one blood sample is usually drawn through a skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction step is not required before screening. On March 26, 2020, the FDA identified 29 entities that notified the agency of the requirements and therefore these entities are able to distribute what they have of antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test under its emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European accreditations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA virus antibodies in blood samples.
The test takes several hundred samples in a matter of hours, and so it's much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of viral ribosome DNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK discovered that the antibody testing kits it had purchased were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has a plan whereby suspected infected patients can stay at home, "give the patient a sample tube", spit in the tube, and return it again to get a test result shortly after. The NHS has announced that it is piloting a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus eliminating the risk of transmission from infected people when they come to hospital or the need to sterilize the ambulance used. When testing for suspected cases without leaving the car, the healthcare professional withdraws the sample taken with appropriate precautions.
South Korea's car-scanning centers have enabled the world's fastest and most comprehensive range of tests. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it was able to conduct about 12,000 tests per day for outpatients and 10,700 people were tested in the past week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance if a doctor orders the test.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, virus testing inside the car was made available in several major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive cases were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of week 12/2020, with 33,491 samples (6.9%) being positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital invented a method to wrap samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and tested that method, by collecting samples and not doing further testing unless the group sample turned out to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI opened a temporary laboratory to detect the case of a 2,000 square meter-square-meter fire with the name "Huo-Yan Eye" (in English: Fire), which can screen more than 10,000 specimens in 2020.[5]
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, overseeing the construction and taking five days to complete, modeling showed that cases in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if this testing capacity had not been achieved.
Wuhan Laboratory immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily production reached 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays released open source, multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need for automated fluid processors.
In March, a shortage of detectors and insufficient ones caused a standoff when a large number of tests were conducted in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sampling protocols that include heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to edit the ribosome DNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates ranks at the top of the world in terms of coronavirus testing per capita, and is on track to scale up testing to most populations.
This was through a combination of activating the testing capability inside the car, and purchasing a population-friendly scale super-productivity lab from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection labs in China).
The lab was set up in 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests to be performed daily, and is the first lab of this size in the world to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different parts of the genetic makeup of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO has adopted the German plan to manufacture kits that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to invent their own kits.
The German plan was announced on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, delaying available tests in the US. China and the US had problems with the reliability of early-stage testing kits, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet demand and follow the testing recommendations made by health experts.
In contrast, experts have stated that South Korea's abundant testing has helped to limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced testing capacity in private laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for intensified testing programs as the best solution to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests being stacked in private US laboratories, and the supply of scanners and chemical detectors has been reduced.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its testing equipment.
In the United States, "defects" were found in the test kits developed by the CDC; the government subsequently removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test from being carried out in particular. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to failure to collect samples or to not using the equipment properly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw from the purchase of kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested it be dumped in the Danube River. Professor Aç Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and had been "prohibited from use". The United Kingdom also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, which followed a quarantine of those who had tested positive and tracked those who mixed with SARS-CoV-2 infected, yielded positive results.
Researchers in the Italian city of Fo, which saw the first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about ten days each time.
Nearly half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the inter-city curfew, new infections have been eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore saw a significant drop in the rate of spread compared to other developed countries, but without stringent restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments; through strict tracking of contacts and restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore had already begun urging residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on time after the holidays.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic through strict tracking of smugglers and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent lockdowns, as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have more tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower death rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories for testing confirmation.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the following graph, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the policy of the country in conducting the test.
A country that tests only for hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive cases than a country that tests all of its population, whether they show symptoms or not, assuming all other factors are equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands in order to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap regularly at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anus.
People can also get respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five essential moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important include: before and after defecating, after cleaning the baby's ass or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry and after.
If soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after the meal.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a child's diapers or cleaning them after using the toilet.
After you clean your nose, or cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, or their feed, or their waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for individuals in general.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea, and reducing cases of respiratory infections.
And lower infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to slight improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by nearly a third, which is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea episodes can be linked to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and least costly method of preventing diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) when automatic behavior is applied in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the number one cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause the death of about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet an established habit could save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes.
Hand washing also protects against sores that are transmitted by direct physical contact.
Washing hands has a simple side effect: frequent washing of hands can cause skin damage due to dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of flaking and itching known as hand eczema or dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too much hand washing is also often seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five essential times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce oral transmission: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the baby's back (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing should be practiced in other situations to prevent transmission, including before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing or coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is declining.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at an estimated 97 percent, the United States was close to the average at 77 percent, and China was the lowest at 23 percent. Many behavioral change methods are now available to increase the benefit of handwashing with soap at times of need.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Worm treatment twice a year, along with daily handwashing with soap, and daily fluoridation of teeth, is at the heart of this national program.
We've also been successful in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergents to water enhances the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to reduce the dissolving barriers, and increase the melting.
Water alone is ineffective skin disinfectant because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily dissolve in water.
However, the flow of adequate water helps to purify the...
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transmission from contaminated hard soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because the bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still states that "liquid soap is preferable to non-touch devices for soap injection".
Antibacterial soap has been heavily promoted to health-conscious consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is chosen to eradicate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So if antibacterial soap doesn't affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it's marketed to be.
In addition to a surface stress reliever and a skin protector, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acid regulator, benzoic acid as an active antimicrobial and other skin moisturizers (cacti, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that regular soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclosan, which prevents disease and removes bacteria from the hands.
Hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing the natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on hands.
Hand sanitizer is a non-water-based material for hand washing.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based, rub-sterilized alcohol hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, sanitized hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compounded with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer acrylic acid) in gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcohol-based rubbing sterilizers kill bacteria, drug-resistant polybakteries (methycillin-resistant golden clusters and vancomycin-resistant intestinal granules), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory myeloma, nasal viruses, smallpox, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcoholic sterilizers containing 70% alcohol through rubbing kill 99.97% (logarithmic reduction of 3.5, similar to a 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands after 30 seconds of application and 99.99% to 99.999% (logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of application. Hand sterilizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol rub should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all the fingers and their sides for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, rubbing them in both comforts. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer, especially when hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless water and soap are available.
Repeated use of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless umbrellas or skin moisturizers or both are added to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other rainwater or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol-containing hand sanitizers with raincoats cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial cleansers.
Rarely do allergic pleural dermatitis, pleural syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives in alcohol-based hand washing products occur.
The lower incidence of I.P.I. has become an attractive factor compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Although non-water-based detergents are effective, they don't clean your hands of organic matter, they simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on the ingredients and composition, and historically it has been significantly less effective than alcohol-based, alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Recently, compounds using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, perhaps due to gradual adverse skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Ash or dust may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization recommends using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
Proper handwashing recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands in hot or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing pools may be contaminated, and at the same time the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Make a foam on your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods of time removes more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands inside the tub may re-contaminate it.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers, and the under nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent dry hands, as dry skin can damage it and increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water, soap, or both are not available, such as pouring water from a properly drilled or suspended container and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to streamline water consumption, such as the "Tippi Tap" and other low-cost options.
The tap tap is a simple technique that uses a rope-mounted jar, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water onto the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand-washing process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of studies suggest that paper towels are healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Seminar on Paper Towels, to compare the levels of cleanliness provided by paper towels, warm air hand dryers, and the latest jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on the fingertips by an average of 194 percent and on the palm of the hand by 254 percent.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreased on average by up to 76% and on the palm by 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for transmission of infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from hands and the device, and may transmit infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a warm air dryer spreads the microorganisms within 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and the current hand dryers are paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer is an alternative when traveling because soap and water are not available.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing became a medical requirement long after Hungarian physician Agnates Simmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found lower rates of infection with it.
Medical handwashing is for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or foaming gel and rubbing each part of the hands.
You have to rub your hands together and your fingers together.
If there is debris under the fingernails, a coarse brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health care is to remove disease-causing microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is still at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to routinely wash their hands before touching patients, which transmits microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization published a paper on how to wash and rub hands in healthcare settings.
The draft hand hygiene guideline provided by the organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and others have done a relevant review.
Commercial appliances can measure and check hand hygiene, if it is necessary to prove compliance with regulatory rules.
The WHO has five seconds to wash your hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before a sterilization mission, and
After patient care. Adding cleansing chemicals to soap ("medical" or "anti-microbial") adds a pesticide to the hand washing agent.
This extermination element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widely spread. When rubbing one's hand for surgery, provision is required of a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, some chlorhexidine or iodine detergent, sterile hand-drying towels after washing, a sterile brush for rubbing, and another sterile tool for cleaning under the nails.
We have to take all the jewelry off.
This procedure requires washing the hands and palms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from bouncing back from the palms of the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical suit is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For controlling cluster hepatitis in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand sanitization came from the first 20 percent of washing, and it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand washing increased to over 35 percent.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand rubbing with an alcoholic solution to washing hands with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, alcohol rubbing was found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol handwashing in reducing H1N1 influenza A and heavy hand rubs. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating staff about handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to see which of these measures is most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, there is a consensus that hand washing with soap is a basic, affordable tool for good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, you rarely find handwashing faucets near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing can be due to ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap can influence and advocate for it in policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term population behavior change.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three-Star Approach" designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to eventually three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing campaigns to reduce childhood disease and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness raising campaigns that try to achieve behavioural change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an expressive handwashing symbol.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people going through critical situations such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Agnath Simmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishman Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing".
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne and healthcare-associated infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important method of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, signs with "correct ways to wash hands" were hung next to hand washing toilets in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" something means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or to participate in complicity in it.
It originates from the passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase of much wider use in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins by washing her hands excessively in an attempt to cleanse a fictional spot that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes that prompted her husband to commit.
It also found that people, after referring to or thinking about immoral acts, tended to wash their hands more than others, and tended to appreciate handwashing devices more.
Furthermore, those who were allowed to wash their hands after this study were less likely to participate in other compensatory "purifying" procedures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without the presence of soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing rituals that have appeared in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Tifláh, hand washing in Judaism, washing in Christianity and the Ujjal in Islam. Religions also mandate sanitary hand washing, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing before and after every meal.
COVID-19 risk controls at the workplace
The workplace COVID-19 risk controls are the application of occupational safety and health risk control procedures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the job assignment, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the risk of disease in the community, and the risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the public and other coworkers, where basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette, and maintaining routine workplace cleaning and disinfection practices.
Medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 individuals, but who may become infected due to continuous community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have had contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with high labor density, and some large retail locations.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in the case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSH) considers health care workers and mortuaries exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 person to be at high risk levels, which increases the risk of exposure to extremely high levels if workers are performing aerial aeration procedures, collecting samples from or handling a known or suspected COVID-19 person.
Suitable risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of the quality of goods demanded and the ways of obtaining them (e.g. shopping outside rush hours, through delivery services or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be halted. The Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and occupational tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community, and risk factors for individual workers such as age or chronic medical conditions.
It also defines the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The outbreak response goals include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to classify risk controls by effectiveness.
Since the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on workers' behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in the work policy or procedures that require action by the employer or employee.
PPE is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, the correct fit as appropriate (e.g. respirators), continuous and proper wear, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, and proper removal, cleaning and storage, or disposal to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs involving less risk involve minimal contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and garbage containers, being prepared to work remotely or scheduling work shifts if necessary, keeping workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining a routine cleaning and sanitizing of the work environment.
Early identification and isolation of individuals who may be infected is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the fever, signs of fever, and any other symptoms are gone for at least 24 hours without the use of fever medication or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, that employees be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, moderate-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with individuals who are not known to have or suspected to have COVID-19, but may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission of infection in the workplace community, or due to a person's recent international travel to a location where COVID-19 transmission is widespread.
This includes workers who interact with the general public as in schools, high-labour-intensive work environments, and some large-scale retail locations. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing pads, and installing windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the car. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing meetings with virtual contacts, creating false workplace shifts, stopping unnecessary workplace activities, including the development of new information about the use of personal protective clothing or other products, and increasing awareness about the risks of COVID-19 and other factors, including the use of hazardous materials or materials to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on board an aircraft, appropriate prevention controls to protect staff and other passengers include keeping the sick passenger 6 feet away from others, assigning one member of the flight crew to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing.
Disposable medical gloves must be worn by the flight crew when dealing with a sick passenger or touching body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and additional personal protective equipment may be used if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial cargo, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel when sick, self-isolation and immediately reporting to the onboard medical center if a person develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person is in the school building regardless of spread in the community.
When there is a limit to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or band classes or dining at the cafeteria, increasing office distances, organizing successive attendance and departure times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health desk for children with flu-like symptoms can be implemented.
When there is a high transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school-leave schedules may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform routine daily activities, the direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during detention, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reuse with a spray or household cleaning wiper, follow standard work procedures for dealing with contamination, disposing of used personal protective equipment, collecting and washing clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers some health care and mortuary workers to be in high or very high risk categories.
High-risk jobs include those working in health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This becomes a very high level of exposure if workers perform procedures to generate airborne vapour, as well as collect samples from or deal with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-generating procedures include tubing, coughing procedures, cataract examinations, some dental procedures and tests, or collecting endothelial samples.
High-risk mortuary functions include those involved in preparing the remains of people confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become extremely high-risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these high-risk groups include isolation rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, including when performing aerial breathing procedures.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and for the storage of cadavers.
Samples must be handled with level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating incoming patients in separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends using respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those performing airway respiration procedures.
In the United States, respirators with a face mask fitted with an N95 filter, certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better, must be used as part of the comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation and fitness testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of hooks, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends that only surgical masks be worn by screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, care for them, or transport them without any procedures to generate airborne respiration, the World Health Organization recommends using a surgical mask, protective eyeglasses, or a face shield, syringe, and goggles.
If aeration is performed, the face mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, the WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through remote medicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only PPE needed for the specific task, continuing to use the same respiratory mask without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis and monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and avoiding the use of masks for individuals who do not show symptoms.

Subject line: [COVID 19] Lifting the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of transmission: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: No rights reserved
We've found ourselves in extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a clear demonstration of global human connectivity and the responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global empathy and cooperation and community building, which are the elements that are at the heart of this institution.
The close friendship and caring that we have experienced among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable practical proof of the amazing human feelings that surround, fortunately, the way we do business.
I feel so grateful and so proud that you are true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is that the world is now turning to Wikipedia, and the powerful symbolism that this vital resource remains online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it's by keeping the sites running, or getting our colleagues paid, or keeping our communities safe.
The world is in desperate need of the information available on Wikipedia more than ever.
It's a moment where we're not just making a positive impact on the world through our efforts, but also the way we do it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're making major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Changes to the way we work and the timetable.
As Rubin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our approach and our timetable for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought might be the right response to what we're facing, and the ideal way to keep the organization's business sustainable during this period.
We wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce the burden and tasks, that's fine.
For all workers, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday, so if you're able to work longer than your usual hours, you might add to the effort.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to care for loved ones, get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We're not keeping track of your time.
If you're sick, you don't have to work.
Permission should be understood as being unspoken, but we certainly mention it.
You do not need to take sick leave or paid leave, just inform your manager and help your team review the calendars and schedules to make sure the main areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor diagnoses you with COVID-19 and you are positive, please tell Brian at the Training and Certification Department so that the Training and Certification Department can help provide support and make sure you get the proper care from the department.)
Hourly workers get their full pay.
We've already mentioned that, and we renew that commitment to our commitments to our contractors and our hourly coworkers.
Each employee will be paid according to the usual working hours under normal conditions.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many individuals use work to overcome the pressures of the world around them.
What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially during times of crisis like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We ask you to contact your manager so that he can find out what to expect and adjust the procedure accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things we need to keep going.
The site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, honesty, fundraising (and others) are doing a critical job, which may need further support.
We will begin a process of working with all departments to evaluate current targets and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to accomplish our mission.
There's a lot of work we all need to do, and we'll focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us later.
We're not planning on "doubling down" after the pandemic.
We're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines when it becomes appropriate.
What's going on in the APP?
To accommodate the new reality and the expectation of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our 2020-2021 annual planning.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while aligning with those who need or want to work on a reduced work schedule, over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule relieves the burden of the current planning work and the pressure across the organization.
We'll present our proposal to the board next week and we'll update delegates and teams on next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their pioneering role in this.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning.
We learned last week that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and prohibition, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to clean all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team used a grade-A antiviral solution used in hospitals to disinfect all the surfaces, as well as the hallway and the elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its own duty of care protocol using products that support tenants' safety.
We feel comfortable that the office is properly prepared for the time when we decide to return to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is in a building owned by WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all of our team members at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved to a completely remote location under joint guidance with our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our New York City headquarters know, we've been having a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it might be a change, and they'd like to give you some advice:
The meeting time should be set at a maximum of one hour or gradually increased to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to divide them into several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, the agenda prepared, and the reading materials sent in advance.
Video should be the default solution, and tools like Google Docs and Zoom should be used to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
The initiative should facilitate each meeting, with someone monitoring the conversation to see the questions and track the list of speakers, and someone else to help take notes (or carry out the collaborative note-taking process).
Email technical support when you need comfortable headphones.
The health and safety compensation scheme can be used to cover the cost of snacks.
You can join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is looking for user-friendly meeting-based guidance to support the increase in distributed work across our organization.
Over the past week, we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the Editathon online events, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for delaying or modifying these goals.
We will release next week additional guidance for follow-up on Wikimedia and other regional community conferences with specific themes.
The general emotions of the global community are mixed between grief over the disruption, satisfaction with the clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and others.
In light of these actions, the Crisis Response Team is designing a MetaWiki page to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up on all communications with it.
Keeping up to date on COVID-19 related topics
We'll send out an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 2:00 PM EST, 7:00 PM Pacific time for the task force meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer questions, and spend time communicating with each other.
We're going through this together and we're always ready to help if we can.
During that time, we can continue to receive information from this email, and all other necessary information about COVID-19 available on the Office Wiki.
The crisis response team will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with workers residing in the worst affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to contact us and cooperate with the crisis response team.
We're always ready to provide support and communication as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Brian Gooden, Director of Global Operations for Human Resources.
Any change in these changes shall not be deemed to waive our duty or obligations.
Instead, it's a realization in the present moment that our work and our commitments are likely to need to be adapted in a way that we haven't in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so we can keep working and provide our employees with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work we planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Now, it's time for everyone to lend a hand and create space for the important work that's coming in the weeks and months ahead.
We need you all to make this happen, and so we need you all to take care of yourselves and your families so that you're at your best when your efforts are needed.
We ask you now to wash your hands and not touch your face!
Catherine, the director of the crisis response team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jimmy V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The converted enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2) binds to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as the intestine.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 opposes the action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entrance for some types of coronaviruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-2 transducer is a zinc-containing metallic enzyme that is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme protein 2 contains an M2-scale peptide with an amino end, and a colectrain carboxyl end that is a carrier for renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1 single-pass membrane protein, and has active enzyme receptors found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The outer cell range of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is separated from the trans-membrane range by an enzyme called shidases, resulting in a protein release that is soluble in the bloodstream and then excreted in the urine.
The enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 is found in most organs of the body: it binds to the cell membrane of type 2 lymphocytes in the lungs, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, in the endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and also in the smooth muscle cells of the artery wall in most organs.
The transducer RNA of angiotensin 2 is found in the cerebral cortex, the spleen, the subclavian region, and the brainstem.
The primary function of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is to act as an antagonist of angiotensin-converting enzyme.
The angiotensin converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 which is a blood vessel-binding hormone.
In contrast, the carboxylic enzyme that converts angiotensin 2 from the amino acid phenylelanine separates it from angiotensin 2 (aspartate-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenyl-alanine) and converts it to angiotensin (1-7), (histidine-aspartate-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenyl-alanine).
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 breaks down into a number of other peptides including [des-arginine9]-bradricenin, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and gerlin.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 also regulates the membrane transit of the neutral transporter of the reverse amino acid SLC6A19, and has a role in Hartnup disease.
Angiotensin-2 transcriptional enzyme, as a transmembrane protein, is the main entry into cells for some coronaviruses, which include human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the association of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 enzyme domain on the cell surface leads to cell retention and the transfer of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles located in the cells.
This insertion process requires the synthesis of protein S by a transmembrane protease enzyme, host serine2, which is still being inhibited in trials as a potential treatment. This leads some to speculate that lowering levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many specialist associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend the continued use of conventional angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that "the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a marked reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to the reference group".
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was reduced among patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors led to a reduction in pneumonia deaths, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
The enzyme converted to human angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung injury, having been found to improve pulmonary blood circulation, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute polycystic ovary syndrome.
The half-life of the converted angiotensin 2 enzyme is approximately 10 hours, while its action begins after 30 minutes, plus its duration (time period) lasts up to 24 hours.
There is considerable evidence that the angiotensin-converting enzyme may be a promising treatment for those with intolerance to traditional angiotensin-resonant system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and for diseases accompanied by elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme in the blood. Clinical trials are under evaluation for the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme infusion in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are software applications for mobile devices specifically designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been put in place to design applications to track offenders.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on geo-location tracking of app users.
The least invasive privacy alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity from other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they had integrated a feature that supports these Bluetooth-based applications, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check whether they have interacted with people with COVID-19.
It's an app that people are using in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, people are using an app called TraceTogether.
The app was designed by a local Information Technology Association, released as an open source application and is scheduled to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to contact with potentially infected individuals and provide a rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in collaboration with the Ministry of Health designed the app.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting Google Play Store and App Store approval from Apple.
On 12 April, the government said that the contacts tracking app was in advanced development and could be available for distribution in weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar app, "StopCovid".
Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app, as well as the BlueTrees.com protocol, and Russia intends to launch an app that uses virtual geo-periphery for patients whose doctors have diagnosed COVID-19 from Moscow residents, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if the use of applications is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that could add their own coronavirus-related apps to its app store; restricting this to "official" or other reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus apps, particularly regarding whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
The surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance should include provisions on when to stop them;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related purposes;
The security and confidentiality of the data should be protected and its protection should be demonstrated on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing the degree of discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be determined by law;
Protection against abuse and protection of citizens' rights should be provided to address abuse;
"Effective participation" is required from all "stakeholders involved", including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from device operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of using apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and allowing tracking to be avoided.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to primary location data have potential major privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems have been created that use central servers for intercommunication only (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials used an app-based system to implement the tracking of the contaminants.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this data to send SMS notifications to individuals with a potential infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential hackers, the government has also made location information publicly available, which it has allowed due to sweeping changes to privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in that country.
This information is publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details about this have not been released.
Privacy-friendly hackers have a proven and successful concept and are backed by strong research literature dating back to at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to come up with privacy-compatible solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record the user's proximity from other cell phones.
However, PEP-BT was a coordinated effort that contained both centralized and decentralized approaches, rather than a single protocol. Decentralization-based protocols include privacy-preserving decentralized approach tracking (DP-PBT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as call event numbers, CENs), privacy-sensitive protocols, and portable intruder tracking (PECTs) mechanisms, among others.
In these protocols, the personal identification data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy technologies when collecting location data or intersecting and leveraging them to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research drawn from the March 2020 report "The Evil Face of Apps: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Face of the Pandemic", the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology development company that also originally originated at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups with interests centered around what was essentially a similar approach and heavily overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing distraction and enabling global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature for achieving widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTress protocol, used by the official government application, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced a hackers tracking initiative, claiming they would maintain privacy by relying on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-saving encryption.
They also published the specifications of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to put the system in three stages, namely:
The introduction of tools to enable governments to create official privacy applications to track the coronavirus.
Google and Apple plan to solve the ongoing usage and monitoring issues by distributing the systems first through OS updates and then by removing them in the same way once the threat expires.
Drug repositioning (also known as reuse, re-targeting, or changing the target or therapeutic shift of a drug) is the re-designation of an approved drug for use in treating a different disease or medical condition from what it was originally designed to treat.
This is one of the scientific research methods that researchers are currently using to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of refined plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each containing multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these linked sites provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective antiviral that kills COVID-19 proteins.
Critically important COV-2 target proteins include the papine-like protease, the RNA-dependent ribose DNA polymerase, helixase, protein S, and adenosine biphosphate ribosphate.
Hussain AA, and others have studied several candidate compounds that have subsequently been refined and analyzed for structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical trial.
Chloroquine is a malaria medication that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs under study as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24. On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA for clinical trials and is licensed under an emergency use license only as an experimental treatment for emergency use for the treatment of patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC announced that it has not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its treatment, dosage or duration".
Doctors said they use the drug when "there's no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
There are big studies going on at Duke and Oxford.
The Langone School of Medicine at New York University is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that favipravir was "clearly effective".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative for an average of 4 days, while the duration of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given favifiravir and the other half were given ominovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has warned people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to add to its reserve stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China Morning, Shinzo Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in treating more severe cases where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who wish to become pregnant.
One study using Lupinavir/Ritonavir (Caletra), a combination of lupinavir and ritonavir antivirals, reported that the results "were not observed to be of any benefit".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to reach a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease, and the scientific community is seeing a state of criticism over the redirection of resources to the redefinition of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has added Lupinavir/ritonavir to the international solidarity trial.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdecivir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdecivir has antiviral activity in the laboratory against several filamentous, mucosal and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is that it develops resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two at the University of Cleveland Hospitals; one focusing on moderately ill patients, and the other on more severely ill patients.
There are three clinical trials of antiviral vitamin C in hospitalized patients with acute illness due to COVID-19, as well as two controlled trials using placebo (China, Canada) and a non-controlled trial (Italy).
The state of New York began trials on the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning to conduct a clinical trial on the use of Teijin's Alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat patients with the new coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A phase II trial using a modified form of the enzyme angiotensin 2 is currently underway in 200 patients who are required to join the trial from acute hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without needing to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Currently, low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-center study in Italy of 300 patients to investigate the use of sodium enoxaparin in prevention and therapeutic doses was announced on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs designed to treat previous outbreaks such as Mars virus, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Rebavirin: Experts have recommended the use of rebavirin for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Ominephrine: Experts have recommended the use of ominephrine for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tocilizumab (Anti-Interleukin 6 receptor): Approved from China.
Trials in Italy and China also. See also Tuselizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumed vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been completed for clinical trials, there are several attempts underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A massive outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to massive investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations initiative for vaccine development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment, and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that have progressed to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (oxygen-deficient ribose DNA and ribose DNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, and mRNA-1273)
The viral vector (developer of stage I and candidate vaccine: Moderna, and vector of glandular virus type 5)
According to scientists from the Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in April, there are a total of 115 vaccine candidates in early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with little public information available (presumably in planning or design).
Phase I and Phase II trials conduct a preliminary, usually randomized, randomised, controlled safety and immunity test, at multiple sites, with more accurate and effective doses determined.
Phase III trials usually involve a larger number of participants, including the reference group, and testing for the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease, while monitoring for adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
On or about January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential for a molecular clot vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.

On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Equipment Command at Fort Derek and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had teamed up with Novavax Inc.
In developing and manufacturing a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a preclinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even with the pace of work accelerating it would take at least a year and a half to about two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, announced that it had developed a particle similar to the coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with plans to test in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large amounts of money" for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government needed.

In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of the Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Coalition in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Partners in the Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of CAD$275 million for 96 research projects on COVID-19 medical measures, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "microsurgery-administered SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines elicited strong antibody-specific responses [in mice] that were evident starting 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on oxygen-deficient ribosome DNA as a potential nasal spray.
Using aesthetics, the oxygen-deficient ribosome DNA will engineer replication within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access the giant computers from IBM, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have opposite effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means it can have benefits that go beyond the disease you're fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
The vaccines being developed are probably not safe or effective.
Early research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as mice genetically modified with the enzyme that converted to angiotensin 2, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for Level 3 biosecurity containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome.
When Mars spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS could provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against Mars-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (oxygen-deficient RNA-based) that had completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines under development, all of which were virus-targeted vaccines, two vaccine-targeted strains of the gonorrhea virus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vaccine-targeted vaccine for MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have sparked conspiracy theories that the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, strep throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people in 210 countries and territories were reported to have been infected, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly between people during intercourse, often by diffuse spraying when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When spray is scattered during the blowing process, it usually falls on the ground or on surfaces rather than being transmitted over long distances.
People can also get it when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious in the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before symptoms and in late stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of the retrograde transcription polymerase (RT-PCR) through a nasal swab.
It is recommended that masks be worn by those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks vary from person to person, with some authorities recommending against, others opposing, and others prohibiting their use.
At present, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not show symptoms or may experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is recommended if you develop emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking, or blue face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or strep throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China suffered only from tightness of the chest and clapping.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called a daycare.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports suggest that symptoms may not appear in all infected people.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected without symptoms is currently unknown and under study. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began listing asymptomatic cases in the daily count on April 1; of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) of these cases were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Plagiarism and games may carry large proportions of the virus.
Speaking out loud produces more splashing than normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering the mouth can lead to spraying as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted by bio-aerosol, and testing samples from air pools in the lobby outside individual rooms has yielded positive results for viral ribosome DNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubal and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, the risk is thought to be limited. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can generally infect two to three others. The virus remains stuck on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found to persist for up to one day on cardboard, up to three days on polypropylene and stainless steel, and up to four hours on 99 percent copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective if used correctly; soaps dissolve and stop the protective fatty membrane of the virus, as well as clearing the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken about two days after being transported to the hospital.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of testing, the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the Wuhan Acute Respiratory Disease Group.
The new SARS-CoV-2 virus shares characteristics with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, household soap kills the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 itself.
The lungs are the most affected organ of COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACCE2), which is most abundant in type II lymphocytes in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface-level protein called spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Twelve percent of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had severe heart attacks, and the most common were in critical cases.
The rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors have a very important role in the heart and are involved in its function.
The incidence of blood clots (31%) and venous thrombosis (25%) in ICU patients with COVID-19 may be related to poor prognosis. Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 found widespread dental damage (DAD), and inflammatory growths containing lymphocytes within the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 targets the ECA2-expressing epithelial cells in the respiratory system, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GMCSF-secreting T cells have been shown to be associated with the introduction of single cells that secrete inflammatory interleukin 6 and inflammatory lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
I also reported a lymphatic drain at autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The RRT-PCR polymerase chain reaction is the standard test method.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a swab may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires taking two blood samples two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and released the gene sequencing so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experimentation on the test showed that the accuracy is only between 60 and 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by the Chongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Stained glass seals are bi-sided, multi-lobed with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior spread are common features of early infection.
A sub-lateral spread and a stony crevice may appear and merge with the progression of the disease.
There is little data on the pathogenic microbiology and physiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions from the autopsy:
Microscopic examination: pleurisy, pneumonia, pneumonia and pneumonia
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia, large and atypical synapses, and peritoneal inflammation with lymphatic expansion and the formation of giant, multi-nucleated cells
Acute pneumonia: widespread synchronous damage (DAD) with widespread synchronous secretions.
Widespread sinus damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in the sinus cavities and the cytoplasm
Blood: diffuse clotting within the vessels (DIC); interaction of the white blood cells
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and using the inside of the wrist if a handkerchief is not available.
It is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly after any coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to reduce transmission from those who do not show symptoms. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of infected people into large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected to be developed until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, when only soap and water are available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization recommends two locally produced compounds.
The antimicrobial activity in these two compounds originates from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial pests in alcohol; it's "not an effective hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extradermost oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may help those with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various bodies into a free resource, an online critical care book.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some specialists recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that may result in spraying, such as inhaling or manual breathing.
For health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIR) as well as standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. The CDC explains the guidelines for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended items: personal protective equipment, a respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical goggles. It is best to use respirators (instead of face masks) if available.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of masks under an emergency use permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles like dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain if used for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face protectors, or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not so deteriorated that they require artificial respiration or alternatives, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to those with COVID-19 respiratory failure in hospitals is under active study, with some evidence that it is possible to avoid tubing using a high-flow nasal tube or a positive two-level airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options is of the same benefit to those with a critical medical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive artificial respiration when available because this technique reduces the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nasal spraying. Critical cases are more common among the elderly (over 60 years of age, especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for their population, limiting the health system's ability to deal with the sudden rise in the number of high-risk COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% of cases died.
In China, nearly 30 percent of those admitted to hospitals because of COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Artificial respiration becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 patients and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators must have high pressure control and positive hyperbaric pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory-associated lung injury and chest relaxation.
High positive end-zero pressure may not be available in old respirators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs under trial have already been approved for other uses or are already in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested on people with a serious illness.
The World Health Organization recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use regenerative plasma as an experimental treatment in situations where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
It hasn't been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to prove it's safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect 'infiltrators' using surveillance data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential danger is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. It uses big data analytics for mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence to track infected and mixed people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track the cell phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may have contact with the infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the collected phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention purposes.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Mr. Giulio Galleria, said that mobile phone companies had told him that "40% of people are still moving everywhere".
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend, with more than 42,000 people participating.
The President of Estonia, Mrs Kirsty Kalliolaid, also issued a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of getting injured themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are a giant storm that is hurting people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may be mild with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more at risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data for COVID-19. COVID-19 may affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
COVID-19 in the most severely affected may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, infectious trauma, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include infection, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital were diagnosed with clotting anomaly, specifically increased prothrombin time, while 4% had renal dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of liver enzymes (amine transporters).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in the hospital.
However, the average time between admission to the intensive care unit and death was seven days.
In an early case study, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and overall for cases it was from six days to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent while the mortality rate for women was 1.7 percent.
Postmortem pathological tissue examinations of lung samples show widespread dental damage with cellular fibroxide secretions in both lungs.
Viral cell mutagenicity changes were observed in the lymphocytes.
The lung picture shows acute respiratory distress syndrome .
Heart damage due to elevated levels of troponin or heart attack was seen in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had previous medical conditions. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic status of the region may also affect the deaths.
Estimates of deaths from the condition vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The undercounting of minor cases may lead to a higher estimate of mortality than the reality.
However, the fact that previous injuries caused deaths may suggest that the current death rate is lower than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer acute COVID-19 symptoms, are 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care and are 2.4 times more likely to die than nonsmokers. Concerns have been raised about long-term complications of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has revealed a reduction in lung capacity of 20 to 30 percent in some recovering patients, and lung tests have indicated damage.
It can also cause post-ICU syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections would give those recovering effective, long-term immunity.
Acquisition of immunity is considered possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported that have recovered from COVID-19 and subsequently re-infected.
It is believed that these cases are aggravated if the infection persists more than if it is repeated.
He believes the virus is natural and of animal origin, given the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date for symptoms to appear.
Official publications from the World Health Organization reported that December 8, 2019 is the date of the first appearance of symptoms.
Several measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time it takes since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization in its 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases assigned the emergency code U 07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths and the code U 07.2 for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed with clinical or epidemic SARS-CoV-2 without laboratory-confirmed infection. The death rate from infections is expressed as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate from infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the CFR, which is the percentage of those who are detected and die from a disease, and the IFR, which is the percentage of those who are infected (detected and undetected) and those who die from a disease.
These statistics don't have a time frame, and they follow a specific population from the time of infection to the time of diagnosis.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected people, their presence may provide information about how many people are infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castilloni d'Ada, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Jangelt, the disease spread through carnival festivals, and spread to young people, causing a relatively lower death rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been officially classified as being caused by it.
Moreover, the German health system is not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, maybe about 3% have antibodies, according to an assessment I do on blood donors.
69 deaths have been confirmed (0.004% of the population) due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the death rate varies between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest for men at age 50, with the difference between men and women fading at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Immune differences based on sex, the lack of smoking among women, and men's having concomitant conditions such as high blood pressure at younger ages than women may have contributed to the higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-classified data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
The higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that Coe is an abbreviation for Corona, and WD is an abbreviation for Disease and 19 refers to the year of the first detection of the outbreak: 31 December 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with international labelling recommendations that aim to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public data.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of the names Novel Coronavirus-2019 and Novel Coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease according to 2015 guidelines that prohibit the use of websites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital manufacturers export healthcare materials such as nasal scanners and respirator parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier couldn't deliver it on time, a local startup reversed its engineering and issued the required 100 valves overnight.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
It seems humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus replicating in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that have the best promise of effectiveness.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
They're using earlier studies of SARS-CoV because it's similar to SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three fertilization strategies are being studied.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the molecule vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain molecules of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the protein SpikeS, which helps the virus invade the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (RDNA vaccines, a new technology for creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines produced by any of these strategies must be tested to confirm their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials of already approved malaria treatments have been evaluated, including four studies involving hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Proposed antiviral drugs for reuse in the treatment of the new disease make up most of the Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of Remdesivir across several countries and results due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential COVID-19 vaccines and drugs was conducted as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chlorokin, hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/ritonavir and lupinavir/tonavir combined with interferon beta, are being evaluated.
There is preliminary evidence of efficacy of Remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Improvement in my bed has been observed in patients treated with the neonatal drug Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy. Chlorine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Viral Research points out that although a one-gram dose is recommended, a dose below this is very dangerous and can cause death.
On 28 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as assessed by treating physicians for COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or omefenovir for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory.
Further study of the effect of nitasoxaneide on organisms after its demonstration of inhibition of low concentration SARS-CoV-2 was recommended. Studies showed that the initial synthesis of the spike protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) was necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant shortcomings that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm may be one of the complications of the late stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. The National Health Commission of China added tosilezumab to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
It is being tested at a national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illnesses.
In addition to being used to test for serum ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some infected people.
The FDA approved interleukin-6 receptor-receptor T-cell therapy for the chimeric antigen based on regression case studies for the treatment of cytokine-secreting syndrome of steroid-resistant people with a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no conclusive evidence that tosilezomab is an effective treatment for cytokine-releasing syndrome.
The method of transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of recovering COVID-19 patients to those who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive insemination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and the results were inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus represents the anticipated mechanism of action by which negative antibody therapy can act as a mediator of defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, perhaps other mechanisms could be used, such as antibody-based cellular toxicity or swallowing or both.
Other forms of antibody-negative therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
We can increase the production of the renin serum, which is the liquid part of the blood of recovering patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, to spread it faster.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
