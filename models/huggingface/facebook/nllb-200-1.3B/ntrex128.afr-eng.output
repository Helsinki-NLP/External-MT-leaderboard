Members of the Welsh Assembly Worried They Are 'Looking Silly'
There is dismay among some Assembly Members at the proposal to change their title from AMe to MWPe (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum fear it could provoke a ridicule.
One Labour Party member says his group is concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A Plaid Cymru party assembly member says the group as a whole is "not happy" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "initially" receptive to the name change, but noted that it is a "short speech leap" from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or foolish.
In this context the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Assembly Members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AMe title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a public consultation.
AME is apparently proposing alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the chair, Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the meeting's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AMe and the design of the committee system.
They will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly rejected its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are going off because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner", says Mr. Adams.
"Neither of them are there today".
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways these days", he says.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood family rooms that people frequent".
As for churches, he worries that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will be back to exactly where they started".
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining havens.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white", he says, "and will therefore bring the day when these churches close down even closer, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930's.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members were making plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's has not replaced him.
What has been taking place at St Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, which is made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese was "trying to pass the cost" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobster on the first day of lobster season in California, officials say.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then rode with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the thrill of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he was calling, 'I've been bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire clavicle was torn open", Hammel observed as he approached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined to be a non-hazardous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his torso.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are struggling with department store-style beauty salons staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods decline, the larger beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is taking place as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its cosmetics portfolio to 3,000 products, including for the first time brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup line so that the majority of products are scarf-friendly - something that younger shoppers are increasingly pushing for.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second set to open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a shift to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to entice people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are becoming more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food items from the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since buying both of these chains two years ago, which they say has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument over how to split the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for £125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brand names is designed to meet every need and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling beauty destination challenging the old fashioned way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has walked away "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled her out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The This Morning host, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when TV's golden girl announced Tuesday at a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune, according to insiders.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
Says a source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw absolutely stunned all involved.
No one could believe what was happening Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning host, one of Britain's biggest money-making stars, could cost the firm millions because of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to cleaning and household clothing, and the possibility that its launch could encounter even more delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Harsh Words 'And then We Fall in Love'
He scoffed at the criticism he was about to receive from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma "newsreader" voice.
"I have given up nothing".
He mentioned Kim's interest in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations were raging.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership summit in Singapore, that the North does not see a "consistent response" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump took a much more optimistic line in his rally speech.
"We are making excellent progress with North Korea", he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - it has ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killed hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non - governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult", said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia endures constantly, the country remains sadly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging at best.
Natural disasters complicate the logistics even more.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a focus of his election campaign and has spent lavishly on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is plagued by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing the pressures of mounting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of displaced persons, including Christian and Muslim gangs, fought in the streets with knives, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks off a good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported for Sturridge when he was about 30 yards out of Chelsea's goal and his team was 1-0 down.
He tipped the ball to the left before kicking far into the goalpost.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it floated to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga tumbled and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and type once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked".
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper returned to Mateo Kovacic with a backhand kick in that playing space before he scored near midfield and scored in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic was quick to receive and sign in midfield.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard overshot the defence and ended up with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the far-away goal.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Numerous people were reported to be trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude quake on Friday, causing fires of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after wife was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7.55am in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I urge anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead who suspects anything to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman showed up at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being told it will take hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling one man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She repeatedly said, "It's so awful".
At 2pm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers have been left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to call @MerPolCC at DM, 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Cromwell's statute of parliament becomes latest memorial hit with "rewrite history" controversy
His banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "silly" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The picture-taking of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Killer Pig Shatters Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname, Yuan, was found dead with a torn skull covered in blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found the door to a neighboring pigsty open.
He said there was a big boar in the cage with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination reportedly confirmed that the 550-pound pig bit the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and torn", said the cousin, who was called Wu on his last name, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the marquisate are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pinched a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife had put the animal off.
After an Oregon farmer was fried by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playful.
They're cute, very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect", he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.h., a Category 1 hurricane, as of 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was positioned 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trove over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and move eastward to the U.S. west coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching drought, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste runoff, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will produce locally rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Kitzfloods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the distributed nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be most unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep gorges to clog rivers, and thunderstorms will bring strong local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth reefs.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
A few scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start October warm, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday the poignant testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for Friday's on-the-spot twist: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunkenly molested her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who are looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience the size of one for a deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS on Friday morning where protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes downcast as CNN imagined him being slandered.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told: "Your power is more than many women's power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and walked in front of the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered live hours later when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate by one vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations against the candidate for next week, as the Democratic minority had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British MEP May accuses critics of political game over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politically playing with Britain's future" and "undermining national interests" in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May appears at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Police arrest suspected in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the standoff.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-affiliated WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for its "zeal and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "appalled and shocked" at Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", said Wayde.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City
Ashes spewed from the Popocatepeti volcano have reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater, registering 183 releases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center has monitored multiple tremors and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gas covering car windscreens in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
Known as Don Goyo, the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before independence vote commemoration
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by riot police, sprayed eggs and powdered paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
A fight also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their batons to keep the fighting under control.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted in one tone "No Forgotten, No Forgiven" in confrontation with the unionists' cry of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the marches, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but turnout was low, with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the continuation of voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year was one of the best times we had.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a vital but scathing victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-imposed exile or in pre-trial detention for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since late last year, announced that he would stand in European Parliament elections next year.
'Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,' he said.
London: Men arrested after car crashed into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livigston's promotion stunned Rangers by moving Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference as Gary Holt's team moved into second along with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have remained unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face the forwards Heart, who are eight points ahead, next week.
Rangers will not be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League until Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their undefeated run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still without a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead long before they scored a goal, with their breast-feeding that brought Rangers all kinds of trouble.
SR broke through but rolled in front of the goal, then AL could only play wide after he came closer and met CH's head across the goal.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could get the visitors with deadly moments.
And so the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining to give Menga a shot and score from the middle of the frame.
By that point, Rangers had dominated possession but could not break through the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a rebound from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow ticked wide to avoid another open game from Livingston.
Overcrosses repeatedly reached Livingston's frame and repeatedly turned it off, while two penalties  after Halkett's challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball  were dismissed.
 Phenomenaal of Livingston  analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal play and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and manning have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the top flight, but much credit goes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic with his magnificent defensive lineup while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they did in times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and they could only penetrate the home side once, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a falling out over issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque but numerous supporters then showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The clashing protests reflect the division of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hailed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died at the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and bus diversions are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a maximum security men's prison, the prison office said.
Riot broke out at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist Tornado Guard was called in to handle the riot, which involved eight prisoners confined to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said, "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to investigate an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the prison's chief executive was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October riot police were called in to address serious disorder involving personnel being attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flooding
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week if the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwestern desert, bringing imminent flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued Monday and Tuesday flash flood warnings for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border".
National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to gain 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the immediate flood risk, Rosa's rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category", weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa is making its way to land along the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore loses its strength.
So it is expected to make landfall in tropical storm strength in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning and then moving through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest threat expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found Saturday at approximately 4:00 AM BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered under the mischief, the wrath' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered from the meanness, the wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her claim.
The President said Saturday that Americans had seen "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a clean record of public service", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president was referring indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican ascendancy in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing", he said.
That is why I am fighting for these candidates everywhere".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the beach town of Palu on Friday when fires up to six meters (18 feet) high broke out on the beach at sunset, washing away many after their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved across the open ocean at speeds of 500 miles per hour [800 km/ h] before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afternoons shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's tremor was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits on the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant", saying thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter.
Communication "is completely hampered by no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media can be heard of a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings about the coming tsunami to people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused major power outages that cut communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to more than 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision personnel from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where workers are sheltering in cover shelters set up in their office courtyard, they passed scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
Even as relief groups began the grueling task of getting the relief work underway, some people complained that experienced foreign relief workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas can only be activated after the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can open it up for international aid, but it doesn't have a status yet".
As the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami dawns, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief from the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped for two days under rubble with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachuting team, trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute weaving field, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated on social media among the parachuting community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who were participating in the beach party.
However, his messages were answered with only one gray check mark, instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car was clearing an ATM at an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye
Announcing the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all-new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's producer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'you' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" said West earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye just reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, among others, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come through with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, leading up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to tame the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza that killed up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training attract youths to gangs.
The US Should Double Funding for AI
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government made AI announcements, even though the US lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest rated American Othello player and later was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking away the academic leadership; it is the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policy can also help to bolster U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to PhDs in AI", he said.
China's State Council released their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence that aims to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Selection Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has come under fire in recent months.
Macedonians vote in election whether country's name should change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership boots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to the territory and has refused them admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has sown doubts about whether the turnout will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price to pay to pursue admission of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the result of the vote to pass it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of any irregularities as of 1 p.m.
But turnout was then only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's European Parliament (EM) President Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small railing and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to think of us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum  less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum would be the first serious setback to the policies of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through the whole Brighton defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a midfield pass at the start of the series.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goal.
He then pushed a slide to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back for Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We are happy that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the far corner.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least clinched a promoter's pick with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
"Although we're not playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point I'll face this year.
Why would I want to be part of it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly favorably disposed to having Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, had a pitching practice Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holding rallies in West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican ascendancy in the midterm elections.
"Everything we did was at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big  I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I'm fighting for these candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back power by any means possible, you see the meanness, the cunning.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them".
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And one sees it over the last four days", he said, and went on to call the Democrats "evil and mean and cunning and false".
He referred to the name of Senate Judiciary Committee's top ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received a loud cheer from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting one  that was really weak body language  the weakest body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it was hardly a surprise.
I am the last person in a string of Labour MPs who have been told we are not welcome - all because we have said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment for taking a bold stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, that was exactly what AR meetings were on Friday nights.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of "friendlier, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I shared similar political views in the past began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never have agreed with otherwise  whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public  and it doesn't really matter what I say  there is a tirade of social media abuse demanding that I not be re-elected, rejection of politics from the heart and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I am actually happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shrink back.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "motion of no confidence" or change in selection rules, the party grows more tense.
I have had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken and then to be "okay".
But I did not enter politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party as a scholar 32 years ago, spurred on by the Thatcher government's neglect that left my state high school literally in ruins, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most  whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in the least bit confused about my policy positions and areas where I differed from the current leadership.
To those who put forward the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country heading towards a Brexit that will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political gain will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr up
Two late threes may have slightly skewed the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the points table, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested so far in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I should be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute three, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored an uncapped three.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty just before he, just before half-time, hit a solo three to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, scored by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay to a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott being carried off on a portable, and from the restart Ayr extended the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, disguised by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unassisted three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very tight game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for killing Climo without the ball, MacPherson pushed the ball from the penalty spot behind the incoming Ayr loose.
Climo deliberately did this, as he had done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's goal and sent off Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star appears to be moving into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old stars as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen way to Pacific
Sailors patrol a masonry-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were plastered with the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
It is a duty to get it back".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is as fresh as the need to sail the Pacific once again.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that  after decades of sporadic negotiations  Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president  who faces a controversial re-election fight next year  also has much to depend on Monday's ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last protest shows that the case "was not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has tapped any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold them.
The last time the two countries exchanged ambassadors was in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial differences", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - continues to use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless their U.S. can be trusted
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rival countries.
His remarks follow US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore's with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and US capture of a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking meaningful steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest range of large head covers heading to stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or avoid the sun altogether, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of loose oversized headgear to their SS19 collection on the runway that captivated the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Extremely impractical hats have been on Instagram this summer, and these designers have been parading their stunning creations on the runway.
The highlight by Valentino was a large beige hat with a feathery wide rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other large accessories included jewel- adorned watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple  but these were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had embroidered lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear, including a snorkel and diving goggles, while another looked like a molten ice cream cone.
And if you continue the great fashion statement, this is your lucky day.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats follow shortly after the heels of "La Bomba", the two-foot-wide-brimmed straw hat seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread across social media sent another great creature across the aisle  a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model who wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frills and finished with a white leather handle on top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashionweek.
Renowned designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in stores for next summer  as the designer has made such an impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills Essential to World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a string of achievements of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see global languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when it comes to building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of scholars who studied foreign languages scored higher than A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A-level in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same status as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Jobs and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employees give for struggling to fill jobs, 17 per cent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a life-long skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in today's children's language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the future of the country, and therefore this must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should be viewed as truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It must be done well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the exact number of minutes he will play remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited amount of time.
After a practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to get ready at this point in my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
It's Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for the coming week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently being held back for his choice to fill the vacancies on the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when voting takes place in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live streamed below.
Trump is likely to focus on this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main focus of these overflowing rallies is to help the Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that these five rallies in the coming week are aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, could draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and could be covered by the media in Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind by voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to give him a boost at the ballot box", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage in the fight to keep hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the four-player Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely outmoded sporting concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this one.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
"They were ahead by six points and now it's four, so we're carrying that as a little bit of momentum, I guess", said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points ahead and 12 more to play.
However, Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have so little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal from the beak to the clearing and led by his example.
That celebratory score grew harder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win Game Four completely in a tie as he and Thomas were two behind after two rounds.
His set-up, which won the game for them at 15, was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team still has a chance.
"You really just have to get everything out and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all those players have left now.
18 holes to print their stamp.
The only players to have more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's single but charming couple got four out of four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to record no hits on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided hits on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine on Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to claim a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time or at different pits.
However, it is too early to talk of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short meets with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was playing with Alex Noren.
One hold on the job and two doubles on the top nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they could barely get out of.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The fours and fours are so exciting to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has always been better as a team, taking a significant lead on the final day, but this four-match series also showed that the US team has the courage to fight a battle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 during the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming 10-6 ahead of Saturday's four-ball and four-game series.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unevenly performing American team in the morning's four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but not letting the deficit shrink.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they played together to beat a freshman Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, has sometimes shown flashes of brilliance but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning's foursomes, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2-1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always make sense on a pleasant day with a wind blowing southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record on Saturday with two points.
They scored a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 3&4 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point deficit when entering the singles, although Furyk's team only has to play in a tie to retain the trophy because they already hold it.
However, after two days of second place, they do not seem to be able to make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "definitely not" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbate their distrust of the United States and that the country will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken "meaningful goodwill measures", such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the U.S"., he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm unilaterally first".
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for taking gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful in that it did not unconditionally reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim pledged to work for "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'destruction of nuclear weapons first' and is putting more pressure on by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve its goal in a compelling way, even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust".
Ri did not say anything about plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader had brought to the attention of the United Nations earlier in the week.
Rather, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party in this nuclear disarmament issue had been South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end".
The tone of Ri's speech was nevertheless dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at the US mainland after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "firefighter" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still remain until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and without pause until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons".
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dry up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making "insulting demands".
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consistent measures".
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is giving all its undergraduate students more sleep in an effort to counter the growing macho culture of studying by using caffeine-fueled "all-night sessions".
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often uninformed about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory where students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that this will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'study all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students have meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough good-quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" for avoiding stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which keeps you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting alarms for when to go to sleep as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goal of Menga defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another heartbreaking loss as Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard's disagreeable team a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard just his second relegation in 18 games as manager so his side were eight points behind Hearts, who had been untied in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and it didn't look like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers now drop to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And further trouble may lie ahead for Rangers after Border Patrol Judge Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr to the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his prime with the way his well-trained team smashed their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored points after just two minutes when Menga's first delivery sent Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor's goal,,, but the midfielder opened his big opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss the back of the net.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored a penalty at the quarter-final when he faced Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots on target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a goal from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, if only for their hard work.
Once again, Rangers have not been able to handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact as the wing sent Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett packing long ball after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had yet another late claim for a penalty kick when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TALK FOREVER ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a mainstay of science, and it has also become a mainstay in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Gosh, this is cracking about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'see' predatory cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predatory cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify predatory cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, transforming them in a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it back.
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began making a pro-Trump mockery speech after his appearance on SNL, while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a lengthy performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he lashed out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they're like, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star poked fun at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, footage of West's being reviled by comedian Chris Rock was uploaded on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that he was made difficult behind the scenes by what he wore on his head.
"They bullied me from behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West took the lead, "Do you want to see the low ground?" and said he would put on his "superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love".
His comments caused an outcry from the audience at least twice and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio went dead quiet".
West was introduced as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhythm guitarist Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE HUMBLE".
But chat-show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply "was who he is and that's absolutely wonderful. "
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe embraces and preaches an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free.
So do we", she added.
Before the performance, the lyricist announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the creature that used to be known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rhyming chatter, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course late music legend Prince changed his name to n symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for arson at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast District Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles often mean that young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strongly" about working on this issue.
'I personally feel pretty strongly about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with manhood?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they must have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because something was clearly wrong with our young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be participating in any of the Game of Thrones sequels and spin-offs when the series comes to an end next summer, as he says he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones was meeting his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the site of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, representing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have acquired HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters responded Saturday to allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and more heinous lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety were compromised by this fraudulent and false claim - was not responsible for the leak of this information at all.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie".
Waters' statement soon drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is evidence of anger", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
He should not be provocative.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and quiet".
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being seemingly too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to push Waters out of the midterms, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "has notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for anything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - faint Rowan Atkinson spy pottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new British-themed film and this seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy satire franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and struggled further in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-the-mouth self-satire on the subject of how obviously powerful we are be the nation's new executive?
Anyway, the clumsy Johnny English with his pimples and rubber face has renewed his license to wreck everything for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English speaking film audiences.
He's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire anthem at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international man of mysteries, leaving chaos behind, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard commercials.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English walking up to a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and briefly cutting the screwdrivers off his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is showcased but the humor feels rather bland and peculiarly redundant, especially when the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now themselves use comedy with confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's misfortune is not as original and focused as Atkinson's silent film jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perennial thematic assumption now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, much to the dismay of the agent on duty - a pitiful little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a Prime Minister who is a bloated and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is in jeopardy, she must call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but who from the record gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-purpose role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are about to completely screw everything up in Her Majesty's Secret Service completely back on duty and they come down on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
Nothing is spared for that final scene, but as cute and lavish as it may be, the whole affair is rather like children's TV.
Pretty mediocre, you know.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brought out her talent?
Labour denies it is devising a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that would see Britons working a four-day week - but being paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants company-wide savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be transferred to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This will give workers a three-day week - but they will still take home the same pay.
Sources say that it will "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the workers' favor.
The change to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power away from "faceless directors" and "profiteers" at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a Labour government can make 'deductions' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to give employees 10 percent of equity in private sector businesses, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley, a Republican, asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do it?
He was determined, firm, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be unchanging.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has been adamant about denying it", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any changes".
What is World Citizen's Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a particularly impressive group of performing stars with an equally impressive goal: the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy not only performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen's Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivisme" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different causes.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most notable commitments include Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to reach out to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional deficiencies.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on his website that asks "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use navy for "blockade" to stop Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington could leave him on its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as energy brokers just like in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe", he is quoted as saying.
And, according to one official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, to blockade, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoners".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the highest level of sport", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren lied about her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he "is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The poll showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed for possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with one count of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injury that our soldiers are returning with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of her son and other veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back wondering if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court lawsuit Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang boys", abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy", said the friend-of-the-court legal task force.
Attorneys further argued in the subpoena that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy and says they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June directed immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems  even all the serious problems  that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly grim.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she consoled her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through waterlogged property, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, are resting outside Palu's military hospital where patients are being treated outside due to persistent strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the rubble of the walls, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US Ambassador Accuses China of 'Bullying' with 'Propaganda Advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid editorial in the Des Moines Register  Iowa's top-selling newspaper  after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections of November 6,  a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in an escalating trade war that has led to their equalizing tariff barriers on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now escalating the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government is seizing America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited dissenting voices at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing and see no real reflection of the divergent opinions held by the Chinese people about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers turned down the offer to publish its article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
While many top Republicans stand up for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in defence of him in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are very high, and most Republicans are on record as already indicating that they want to go ahead with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) 's encouragement for an FBI investigation at the drop of a hat would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday  they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among suburban swing-style female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who do not vote often because they do not like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a backlash could follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"It's become a mess for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets on the bench, it's about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony definitely or probably, while 35 say they believe Kavanaugh definitely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely shook during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while he was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt is "global domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the project.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls this "data-based personal empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to launch a total change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Cross religious celebration
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns".
He later rushed to the line of fire and, with "the utmost bravery", led the line forward before he single-handedly stormed a field gun and knocked out three of the platoon.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I know I could never do, but something that is humbling".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "felt honoured to be able to play a part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people".
MMA fans stay up all night watching Bellator 206 but get Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night watching the packed Bellator 206 only to miss the main event.
San Jose's program featured 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to announce the fight, viewers in the U.K. were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake until the early hours especially for the battle.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sick joke".
"It's government policy that the content at 6 p.m. was not appropriate and so they had to switch to children's shows", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably work something out", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six as we normally do and we've tried to offer more to our fans and just go over our time.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality but that it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until he entered high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had lied about his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejectionist on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, are the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says that he lied about his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said falling in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "caught him off guard".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" He went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later He said it was difficult to find someone of his age who had similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says her "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I should win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about my whole life - to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection  Proud by Heather Small  which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still feeds him chicken.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson not on track and withdraws from Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he'll need to get in shape to stop it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was retired by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball and four-figure games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will split his day between being race leader and working on his game on the practice bench in the hope of fixing what's wrong.
Even at the peak of his career he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long turf always punishes the stray hits.
And as if the course alone were not challenging enough, Mickelson will face outstanding British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson's game could be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be right tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was expecting more, but this is how things turned out and this is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really matched the highlights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's got a way with words, he likes to make a fool of himself, and he's a great guy to have in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed getting crazy with him, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just play".
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a substantial lead before the final day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but won only a nail-scratch by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the nail scraping", Bjorn said, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So, history will show me and everyone on this team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the dots on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our team, but we're also very aware of who's on the other side  the best players in the world".
Rejoicing over how his players fared on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never get ahead of myself with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it is the individual entries that come in, and it is a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there individually, you're being tested to your full potential as a golfer.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your mate behind and he has to get the best out of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk will want his players to do better individually than they did as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself had been on both sides of that great last-day turnaround, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as the loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medina".
"I remember every concealed word of it", he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had talked his players into courage on the way to that final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medina.
When that momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and sorted the men who we felt, you know, would bring us something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and came up against Rory McIlroy in the main draw, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I picked this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it all the way through", Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German military's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be until at least next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
This vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues have plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle-hardened air-to-air and anti-ship missiles as well as a number of secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods  it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships  that would apparently enable Germany to project power overseas  will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The disastrous F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after delivery to a shipbuilder.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Beyond the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project including the training of the crew also touched an issue.
It apparently reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) over the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new frigates are especially significant in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy's "deployable ships are running out".
The official said that the issue has worsened over time, as old ships have been decommissioned but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano night moth as well as the brown langur and Daubenton moths at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the bat's habitat are most important and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects habitat loss and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can flypaper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting activities make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleeping-place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Landlord David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that remains unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the need to search for bats before property conservation because it is possible that the unwitting destruction of a single nesting site could mean the death of up to 400 females and cubs and the extinction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them or to destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo finishing rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What they said today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine,' the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called, according to Reuters, "permissible reporting of suspicion of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for any amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had the hospital take pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved to Italian giants Juve this summer in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will 'regret it forever' if their carmakers lose
The UK 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Works Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant  which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis  produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory cease", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has said that they will close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The indications from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that added costs could reduce the plant's competitiveness in the long run and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union's plant convener, says that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a precise and plausible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be rescheduled, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "deferred for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh and further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that has not been set yet, it could be this week, I can see it being postponed for another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of newscasts is not due to a resentment of TV journalists being "impact-obsessed", although she said: "I wouldn't argue with the fact that they are impact-obsessed".
She hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We looked at the numbers".
Briefings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unconstrained and timely bizarre appearance before a gathering of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will stay after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, leading to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very distressing time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contributions of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineman Christion Abercrombie has had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been removed from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He hit five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move would neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year  to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK with the extra cash to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money helping to fund government plans to combat homelessness.
The surcharge  outside the current stamp duty, including the higher levels set two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent  can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens, which pushes up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country  especially in the capital  have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by hoarding land but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to waive quotas on affordable housing to repair Britain's "housing disaster".
Mr Corbyn announced a striking set of intended housing improvements, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault evictions".
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream  that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be true that it is as easy for non-UK individuals as it is for foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness an overblown reality.
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top scorers.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team, but that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child I often watched Scotland with my father at Hampden and it's something that draws me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I am successful in club management".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety about following such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me will be measured by 'can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I will probably consider myself successful only if I can get the club back there".
Ross's managerial career lasted only three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third tier and convert St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he says, reflecting on how he took over Alloa's reins.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds strange, because I've done enough good, made a reasonable living out of it, and experienced reasonable highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things that one has to come through weekly.
I still go through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable feeling I've had in my own skin in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, survey finds
The summer heat wave improved the income of Britain's struggling pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7% in July  but restaurant receipts were down 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy firm CGA, which compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month, June, when drinking establishments were down 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Drinks-led bars and bars far outperformed and rose more than restaurants fell.
Food-led drinking establishments also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Across managed bars and pubs, sales were up 6.6 percent for the month, with food laundry down 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly difficult on top of ongoing price pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-driven operators and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring much needed relief.
Total sales growth across bars and restaurants, including new locations that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK's industry sales monitor for the drinks, pubs and restaurants sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 industry groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children as young as 11 have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a survey reveals
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages
The news raised fears that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a main account to show parents
One in five children  some as young as 11  create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean main account to show to parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot track them.
Eilidh Doyle will be voting for athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who took the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games among his four Olympic gold medals, is now a regular BBC pundit, unable to run after suffering a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I have made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!
Breast pump ads that compare mothers to cows divide opinion online
A breast-pumping company has shared opinions online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
To celebrate the launch of what has been called "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie  has released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a barn full of straw and cows to the tune of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you didn't see, these aren't oysters, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
But the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many saying that it understates the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Many poorly decided to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth", wrote one.

Another observed: "It is profoundly traumatic for mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for men who can hold their babies?"
Another added: "The ad is so out of touch".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "horrible" to her.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still breastfed.
Milking made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I've accepted it for what it is.
It is a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another observed: "It is a pleasant advertisement for mothers who are milking (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advertisement praising or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they wean.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother, observed: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the milking process and all its challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining way that people can connect with the wonderful feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children in sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by going ahead and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement testified before Congress that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are here illegally, and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to prosecute those individuals", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief would be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that concern is heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child's struggles are more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, is almost over.
He said Damascus will continue to wage this holy fight until we have cleared all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fears that urge refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returnees", he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has thwarted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusations and scandals ends his presidency early.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!
To date, there are no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million peak viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops cable viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time news nights.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand", says Neal Baer, program director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' he told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or reunite immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
To turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of deep background from his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather flying jacket (a garment thick with hubris, The Washington Post said), and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is feed you something every night", says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's changing cast and daily twists in the plot (such as seeking an argument with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Judiciary and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember back then when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out now they were right.

Foreign money flows into the most exciting midterm elections in the House
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a congressional district shift that has now put two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
The newly changed suburban Pittsburgh district is gauging the strength of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delimited in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th began with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a nail-scratching victory in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners fired the Trump Organization's management team.
State department officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress focused on security and economic progress to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to proceed to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the convention, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the gathering for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Studying the Past
The next thing that could happen could be the special hearing on Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to be focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the country's attack on our elections.
Should Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump will face accountability in that body just as he prepares to go before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
This is a bunch of aces, and by that I don't mean that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable, nor that of his European counterparts.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how far the fight can be extended.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy's relentless course is either hastened or slowed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed to secretly take on the president last year and speculated about his fitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair? Or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we look at those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that swastika-wearing table.
With this as my background, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play hosts Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with all that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but there's a feel-good factor in place now.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, put the past behind us and be successful".
Women lose sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it with their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your financing decisions for long-term care may include  a traditional long-term insurance policy,  a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance on your own ability  as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal wrangling at the pass.
Get a healthcare proxy in place so you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts follow your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also, consider proxies for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Spell out those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are at issue, but who are the doctors?" asks Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place".
Man shot multiple times in Ilfracombe with windmills
A man was shot several times with a windbreaker as he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications out of action, emergency responders were unable to get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times during the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake along the west coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and caused about 300 deaths.
2016: A landslide hit Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, leading to destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time it did not lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed by collapsing buildings,
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "not guilty, definitely" when asked what he was advocating, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspected terrorists in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare execution not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan to mow down pedestrians and a cyclist in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and foresight", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's manner of execution as "abominable, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the notice of intent stated.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilise "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics  as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would "be out" by then if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in uniting her deeply divided officers has been instigated by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would push through in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the deadlock, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Means Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to "sweep out the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by then", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand for Brexit, but we have to kick out Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.
Tory Brexitist Andrea Jenkins was also at the march, telling reporters: "I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure we get elected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farge said that the rally politicians had to "feel the heat" if they were on the verge of violating the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let you get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour assembly in the city center.
A few activists waved Tory anti-Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application like the one that opened the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
This is a total nonsense.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to look hard after running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "look forward to running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she may challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump took office.
An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the very top".
Arrest made in LSU's shooting death of Sims
Baton Rouge, LA, police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference, which is scheduled for Monday.
They released a video of the shooting Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was eventually killed", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene, was in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton claims world title after team orders give him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team orders would play a big part in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first, leaving Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the very back of the pack, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes drove a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free leaving the interior at risk of endurance after a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the starting grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he held onto his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the pits on lap 44, but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said to have been a difficult day, because Valtteri had been doing fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having a one-two", said Hamilton.
It was a terrible body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "cruel and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has happened over the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars", he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I'm not going to.
I did not leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak it... No, we didn't leak it", he added, in a statement from the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter outlining the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked".
But the president did not take her denial seriously and commented during the Saturday evening assembly: "I tell you what, that was a lot of bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, suggesting that the Democrats use the allegations for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the cruelty, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to outwit to get power and control", Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's match-up 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by pitches from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed their victory.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who had lost matches and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought home the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the catcher for Cownie's tiebreaker at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again tied them with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on planes can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died while making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swung control tower at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he noticed it was tumbling.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia Yohannes Sirait says the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster relief agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising as many bodies are still under the rubble while many are still unreachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to 20 feet [20 m] tore Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is now missing after beach lake plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific Ocean beach lake in Micronesia now says one man is missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane landed in the beach lake near the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
"It's a particularly good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through medium-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said crews working nearby improving a dock also helped with an inflatable lifeboat to get people ashore back and forth before the plane sank into about 100 feet [30 m] of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts lay out a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
The state closed its case Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was joking because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Not a black person?!
NY kindergarten teacher sues couple for being fired after racist text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from the mother who complained that she was "just another black person".
The couple deny that they are racist and liken the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, lied about her dismay when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO, NOT A BLACK PERSON", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her flair, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, saying that their outgoing African-American nanny did a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages for the dismissal and seeks damages of up to $350 a day for the six months, residential work for which she was initially hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing so well", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple countered the accusations of being racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to terminate Maurice's employment and fearing that they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Go on now".
Plasco likened the case to "blackmail", saying that his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going after someone like that?
It's not a very nice thing to do,' the investment banker added.
While the trial was still ongoing, the court of public opinion was quick to take the couple to social media and to hack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It is very amusing that we know of Paddington's great success".
She said her father would have been eager if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year was "bitter-sweet".
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
"He was a rather quiet man and he was not a cranky person", she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost like having a child who had accomplished something: you were proud of them, even if it wasn't your job.
I think he viewed Paddington's success kind of that way.
Though it was his own creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call to say that it was too bad, that they didn't expect her to make it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I get the call from Nad saying that she will die in the next two minutes and that I should have said hello.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, lamb heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors had given her to keep her heart beating was slowly being drained out of her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was so overwhelmed with tears.
It's hard to explain, but I felt an overwhelming sense of empathy for Nad on the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting postcards on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile brightened any departure".
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect".
Mrs. Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there that you can go to and talk to, even a friend.
Do not sit in silence - you must speak.
Mrs Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say that he was feeling sick or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he did not make eye contact or anything with them".
She said that his death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It tore a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all must go on and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as the FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that has no scope - we might be able to bring some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan buildup.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have had the FBI investigate?
Their objectivity is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush calls on senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea surplus numbers are falling under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet, saying there were 1,127 floods last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China views the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the striking negotiations on denuclearization.
It came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed broadly to work together for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever did that, they would say hysteria", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh had been highly emotional and at times nearly screamed and choked as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "ridiculous and coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's making himself incompetent with those statements and the way he's going after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as it is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?' " Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger boiling over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry with you".
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are permissible as a partial outlet for grief because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of my early work in a male-dominated office is of finding myself once crying in nameless rage and being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an older woman - a cold-blooded manager whom I was a little afraid of - who dragged me down a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have had an effect on you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and had to leave the races, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of running for president.
"I didn't think it through", she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finds, so she vowed not to enter the race unless she had collected $2 million dollars.
It had been a losing battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave men $1,000, she would only get $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotion - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at sexism - that she choked.
You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown, recalled Mrs Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my headstone?
"She cried"?""
How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening voices of the US-China trade war have been deafened and while the fight is far from over, disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (£150 trillion) of items and effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in goods each time, recently slapping tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 trillion worth of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot, and the world's largest economy is not going anywhere any time soon.
Getting Washington to back down means yielding to demands, but publicly complying with US demands would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressures over the U.S. trade war could positively support China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic deadlock in either country is actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously admitted, said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ready for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to restore normalcy to areas devastated by terrorists.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe topped the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA won with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, blew his T-shirt in the water at the par-3 16th hole and gave his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 to 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time European champion with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy that I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to fellow countryman John Ram who on Sunday defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys.
There had been a time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We have deleted.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You must keep your hat tilted.
We are outclassed.
Redness updates: Concentrations are down in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in Red Gety concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, collared bloom conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier cities - suggesting reduced concentrations.
In full bloom, the Red Gety stretches some 130 miles along the coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee Towns.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough town, but in fewer locations than last week.
Redness has also been noted in Pasco City.
Medium concentrations in or near the coast of Pinellas City have been reported in the past week, low to high concentrations near the coast of Hillsborough City, background to high concentrations in Manatee City, background to high concentrations in or near the coast of Sarasota City, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte City, background to high concentrations in or near the coast of Lee City, and low concentrations in Collier City.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the cities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
