Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they'll be called muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been dismayed by the proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament (MMP).
The idea was born out of plans to rename the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are worried that they might become the object of ridicule.
One Labour MP expressed concern about his party's name, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words twp and pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, the word twp means foolish, and the word pwp  means to go.
One Plaid Cymru politician said his group was 'dissatisfied' with the proposal and suggested other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to changing the name, but noted that the word "MWP" sounded very similar to "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in the English Yorkshire dialect.
The committee working within the Assembly, which is currently working on the draft law to change the name, took the following position: Of course, the final decision on the future title of the members of the Assembly will be theirs themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly for Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal, and the renaming of the assembly into the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
The committee also supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the Assembly to 'Member of the Welsh Parliament', or WMP in English, although the abbreviation 'MWP' was the most popular among the public.
Members of the assembly are proposing alternative solutions, and the difficulty of reaching a consensus is a nuisance for Elin Jones, the assembly's chairwoman, who is expected to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also take into account other changes to the way the Assembly works, including the rules for dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is expected to help settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor constitutes a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Georgi Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that change is necessary to allow the country to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells at New York's St. Martin's Church are silent over the problems plaguing churches in Harlem
"The older people I talk to say that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner". - Michael Henry Adams.
There's no sign of them now.
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now", he said.
Bars are no longer a regular meeting place for community members.
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as those in charge think and that 'sooner or later' they will be at the starting point.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the other temples in the area.
As he said, "The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, and this will hasten the complete closure of the churches, because it is unlikely that any new residents will become members of these parishes".
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's Church joined the community a decade later).
The original white Methodist congregation left the area in the 1930's.
The local African-American congregation then took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the vendors on 125th Street (Harlem's main shopping street) who opposed the hiring or promotion of African Americans.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell ensemble.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St Martin's, proudly called the new carillon the "Bells of the Poor".
The expert who rang the bell in July described them differently as 'cultural treasure' and 'unreplaceable historical instrument'.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world to be operated by a black musician, the artist being Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complex events involving architects and contractors at St. Martin's, some by secular church leaders and some by the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, saying it wanted to pass the costs on to the council, although the council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark has injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California.
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California last Saturday, the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the U.S. city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard a call for help, and immediately a group of friends came to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch the lobster, but he soon realized that the baby was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
I got bit!
When Chad Hammel arrived at the scene, he noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around his collarbone.
"I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted by helicopter to Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
At a press conference, rescue officer Captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted several weeks earlier, but was not considered a threatened species.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
To investigate and for security reasons, authorities have closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that the area is home to over 135 species of sharks, although most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand into the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is giving the glove to stores like Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing department stores with department store style cosmetics and specially trained salespeople.
As part of a major investment in the UK cosmetics market  which is worth £2.8 billion and growing steadily despite declines in the fashion and household goods sectors  11 of the chain's stores will have larger shelves with cosmetics products.
The return to the cosmetics industry is the result of the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's says it will double its cosmetics line to 3,000 items, and for the first time, it will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw.
Currently sold items from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to those known from Boots stores, for example.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its boutique makeup line, with most items now vegan-friendly, which is becoming more and more popular with younger customers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will set up test stations at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily small-scale purchases at local stores means that supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the chain tries to fight discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has been introducing a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both companies two years ago, which the company says is helping to boost food sales and increase return on investment.
The previous attempt to reorganise the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments had failed.
In the early 21st century, Sainsbury's set up a pilot joint venture with Boots, but the partnership ended following a dispute over the distribution of revenues from supermarket pharmacies.
Sainsbury's is launching a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m three years ago.
Lloyds will reportedly contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four of its stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of the beauty department to improve the customer experience.
We invested in training our employees to help consumers shop.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and our friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products and challenge the traditional ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from her £11 million contract.
Peter Jones, the star of the television show Dragons Den, was furious when he learned that Holly Willoughby was going to pull out of an £11 million lifestyle brand to focus on his newly established partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of accessories and household goods called Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand on several occasions.
This morning, the 37-year-old news anchor announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's sudden decision to leave a thriving lifestyle brand and focus on her newly established partnership with Marks & Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den.
Sources say Peter Jones was furious when the popular TV presenter announced during a nervous meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5m, he would not have time to devote to their Truly brand of home accessories and items.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is also expected to double Holly Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
After 37-year-old Holly Willoughby announced her decision to leave Truly on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK for one of his summer homes.
According to the source, Mark Truly was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future to it and wanted to take care of it for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business came as a complete surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the market.
There's a lot of merchandise in the Marlow Warehouse ready to sell.
Experts believe that the resignation of the This Morning presenter and one of Britain's most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investment in products  ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and household goods  and will also lead to further delay in market entry.
It can also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Holly Willoughby (a mother of three) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp co-founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them as CEO in March.
The couple had been vacationing together, and Jones owned a 40% stake in a television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs".
♪ Hard talk, and then we fell in love ♪
The president joked about the media criticism of the remarks, which some considered "unfit for a statesman" and his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
I didn't give up anything.
The president noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in a second meeting, the first meeting was held in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "similar response" from the United States to North Korea's early efforts to disarm.
He noted that instead the United States is maintaining sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had had positive results, ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remaining American troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
"It's easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, we'd have 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd gathered directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated one of the islands, killing hundreds
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of over 10% of the population of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a disaster, which is a necessary condition for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so the situation is difficult", said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not certain that international staff will be able to operate on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international aid should be allowed.
The constant earthquakes in Indonesia leave the country completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rare in the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu despite the warning likely affected the death toll.
Even in the best of conditions, traveling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was stationed on Lombok Island is on its way to the city of Palu to help earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's infrastructure a focus of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds for roads and railways.
However, with elections coming up next year, the president's administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo has come under pressure due to the ongoing religious tensions in the country, with members of the majority Muslim community adopting a more conservative form of religion.
Over a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands of residents were left homeless as a result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows, and other small arms.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal in the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal, with the score 1-0 to his team's detriment.
He put the ball on his left foot before he shot the ball into the away goal.
The ball was bouncing high above the penalty area towards the top right corner of the net.
Then she crashed into the goal, flying over the Kepa Arrizabalaga that was hurling at her.
"I was just trying to get in position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to get it as far forward as possible, and I wanted to give myself the best shot", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took the ball and I shot back without thinking further".
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead at half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard, scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic and then ran towards Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic quickly accepted the offer in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful play forward in the penalty area back to Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and returned with his left foot towards the long post, which passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The Indonesian Disaster Agency reported that the number of victims of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country had risen to 832 on Sunday morning.
At the conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday had trapped many people under the rubble and triggered a tsunami wave of 20 feet.
Palu, a city of over 380,000, is full of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation has been launched.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for contact information from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
Brian O'Hagan, commissioner of the Investigative Division, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead at the time who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to all drivers, and in particular to cab drivers, whose recorders may have captured useful material during the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people who claimed to know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they're in the process of informing the victim's family of the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into the apartment building, but was informed by police that entry and exit is currently prohibited.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just been told that they will not be able to return to their homes for the foreseeable future.
One of the officers was heard explaining to the man that the area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
She kept saying, "It's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars in the fenced area, and another police car parked right next to it.
There are officers inside the detached area guarding the residential building.
Those with information are asked to contact us via Twitter (@MerPolCC) or by phone at 101, or to report anonymously via Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, indicating the event number 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell monument in front of the British Parliament, the latest casualty in a dispute over the re-writing of history.
Removing the monument would bring justice to the Taliban-like destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by his radical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The marvelous actions during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas, a century earlier, it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft portrayed Cromwell on the monument reflects the reputation of the 19th-century politician and the fact that many people still remember him.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many people perhaps more often in the 19th century than he is today as the defender of Parliament from external pressures.
The accuracy of this statement is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who identifies one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
In China, a farmer was fatally mutilated by a pig.
According to local media, a farmer was fatally attacked by a pig at a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan was found dead with a bloody and severed artery near a pig market in Liupanshui City, Kuechchchou Province.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm, May 30, 2005, Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
The man reportedly came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring Junnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the man's body and noticed the door to a nearby pig farm open.
He said there was a big pig in the pig with blood on its cheek.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a 250-pound pig that mutilated the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", said a man named Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The mall manager told the Guiyang Evening News that while the police were gathering evidence, the petitioner was isolated to avoid another attack.
The man's family and the mall authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
There have been previous reports of pig attacks on humans, although these are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, fatally wounding the man.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a 300-pound pig had nailed a farmer to a tractor, and the man's wife had pulled the animal away.
After a pig ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior.
They just want to have fun.
They're as curious as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the proper respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to lose strength as it moves over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa, which is blowing at nearly 85 miles per hour, was given a Category 1 status at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, about 400 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The forecast is that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it is beginning to form as it heads eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and on Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, moving moist air masses northward into the southwestern United States.
Monday will bring rainfall of up to 25 centimeters in parts of Mexico.
In the coming days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwestern United States.
In some places, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 centimeters will lead to flash floods, pollution displacement, and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause rainfall of between 5 and 7.5 centimeters per hour, particularly in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 centimeters of rain are forecast in parts of the Southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
The scattered nature of tropical rainfall can cause flash floods and rapid changes in conditions.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, walking through desert terrain is a major challenge.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause local gusty winds and dust to move.
Coming than will bring abundant local rainfall to the coast of southern California.
Rainfall of more than 1.3 cm in total height is possible, which may cause small displacements of pollutants and road hazards.
It would be the first rainfall of this rainy season in the region.
Tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, with more areas expected to experience rainfall on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region of the western United States on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic cools, temperatures can fluctuate across the United States, but it will be warmer in the intertidal zone.
This could lead to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis, Missouri, and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is nearly 10 degrees Celsius.
The summer temperatures may rise again in the coming days.
In much of the central and eastern United States, the beginning of October is expected to be warm, with temperatures expected to range from about 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit [26 to 32°C] in the southern Great Plains to parts of the Northeast.
Tuesday in New York City, temperatures may reach as high as 27 degrees Celsius, or about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh auditions
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the moving Thursday hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, the woman accusing a lawyer of sexual abuse that took place in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political deadlock on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regular broadcasts to report on a sudden turnaround: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, under which the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had stroked her in a state of sober rage and tried to strip her at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that such a situation had not occurred.
It is possible that Friday's television viewership was even higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures were available.
In addition, Nielsen typically has difficulty measuring viewership among people at work.
This is about the same number of people who watched the American Football League World Series or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's broadcast.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday's events.
He was caught on CNN and CBS cameras this morning after the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he had decided to endorse Kavanaugh's nomination, and he was seen shouting at protesters who blocked him from the elevator on his way to a jury trial.
Flake, with his head down, listened to the negative comments for a few minutes, and the whole thing was broadcast on CNN.
I'm standing here before you and I'm asking.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
You have strength in the face of the impotence of so many women. You heard it from a woman demonstrating.
Before the elevator doors closed, Jeff Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he would speak at the committee hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events pending a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he'd only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges next week, which is what the Democratic minority has been insisting on.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after meeting with Chris Coons and a few other senators.
The choice of Flake was important because the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one featuring Theresa May on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked the plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, which would see the UK and EU collecting tariffs on their behalf, calling it 'completely ridiculous'.
Police have arrested Dytheon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
According to Baton Rouge Police Department records, 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on a charge of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released footage of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
According to a report by WAFB, a CBS affiliate, police officers found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Police said after questioning Simpson, he confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the detainee's lawyer, bail has been set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge coroner's office issued a preliminary report, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department thanked the Louisiana State Police Search Team, the state police crime lab, Southern University Police and local residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and commitment to justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne Sims, also played basketball at LSU.
In his final season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"It's one of those things we're always afraid of", said Will Wade.
The ash from the volcano reaches Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Center warned Mexican residents against approaching the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over the past 24 hours.
The center has recorded numerous rumblings and tremors.
Images posted on social media show car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash in neighborhoods in Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Since the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have been reporting an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police strike with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following clashes between pro-independence protesters and police on the eve of the first anniversary of the highly emotional referendum on Catalan independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powdered paint at police officers, and dark clouds of dust streamed through the streets, usually crowded with tourists.
The clashes continued later in the day, with police using batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while opponents of secession shouted "Long live Spain".
Local media reports that 14 people have received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, tensions are still high, and while the Madrid authorities have declared it illegal, it is still cause for celebration among Catalans who want to secede.
Voters overwhelmingly supported independence, but turnout was low due to a widespread boycott by opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting at polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of people who support the region's independence decided to prevent a demonstration in support of the police.
The demonstration was held despite this, but was forced to change the route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said that he no longer had any hope for Catalan independence.
Last year we had one of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
My parents cried for joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck at the point of no return.
Despite a significant, albeit small, victory in the local elections in December last year, the pro-secession parties are struggling to continue their activities, with many of the most recognized leaders having decided to leave or awaiting trial in custody over their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a phone call in support of the police, said that politicians on both sides of the conflict were fueling the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his intention to run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values in the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after driving into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested following a series of car crashes in a house in the town of Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 (BST).
Detective Commissioner Bob Blemmings said damage to the gate and the building.
At some point, a shot from a crossbow may have been fired at the car.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston win against Rangers 1-0
Dolly Mengi 's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Livingston, who had been playing in the top flight since the end of the season, stunned Rangers by beating Steven Gerrard for only the second time in his 18 games as manager at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Mengi's goal was the winner, and Gary Holt's team moved into second place in the table with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten in the Premier League this season and next Sunday they face the Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, because on Thursday, the Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna for the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston extends their division winning streak to six games, and Coach Holt hasn't had a losing season since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed several chances against unwilling opponents.
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as team play has caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defence and returned a shot to the light, but failed to score, then Alan Lithgow missed after taking over from Craig Halkett.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing they could threaten their opponents during consistent stretches of the game.
And that's how the deciding goal came down.
After the Rangers' free-kick, Livingston's team found an opportunity, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a situation for Mende to score from the centre of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possession, but they could not overpower the home defense and did not cause much trouble for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
That pattern was repeated in the second half, when Alfredo Morelos hit one shot into Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the goal light from another fixed fragment in favour of Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks at Livingston's penalty area but were unable to take advantage of the situation, with two penalties from Halkett's intervention against substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand-play, both of which were dismissed.
 The phenomenal performance of Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and a score for Livingston.
He said they played brilliantly, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have remained almost unchanged since their return to the top flight, but Holt is to be commended for his motivation to keep the team playing.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made sure that Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers were running out of fight.
Although they've had some great moments under Gerrard, they haven't kept their standards in this game.
There was something missing in their game, they only managed to break through the home defense once, which should be a serious warning to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany were greeted by smiles and beautiful weather at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between the NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks living outside their homeland.
Police said that for security reasons, the 25,000 people who were gathering outside the temple were blocked, but the president's supporters were gathering in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning the Turkish leader's policies and the German government's decision to adopt a policy in the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the divisions created by the visit of a politician hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has died after a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the busy intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the city's south-eastern suburb, at around 10:15 (BST).
The driver stopped the vehicle and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident, and the perpetrator fled the scene.
Metropolitan Police said officers are working to identify the dead man and notify family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and buses were organized to tour the area, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Correctional Facility: six officers injured in riots
According to the facility's authorities, six officers were injured in riots at the high-security men's prison.
The riots at HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire began around 9:30am (BST) on Sunday and are still ongoing.
The special unit "Tornado" was called in to assist in the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing of the facility.
Officers on the scene suffered minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: "Special trained staff were involved in the operation at HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities, and we are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison.
HMP Long Lartin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the head of the facility had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the plant was called in to prevent a riot in which workers were attacked with billiard balls.
Sudden flooding from Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, and it's likely to do so early next week, as the remnants of Rosa move across the desert areas of the Southwest, creating a threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The weather forecast says Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix, and the rains will begin on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was approaching 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5 to 10 centimeters. In some areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona, it can reach up to 15 centimeters.
In the remaining desert areas of the Southwest  including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin  the rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For those outside the flood-prone areas, the rainfall from Rosa may bring relief, since the region has been experiencing a drought for some time.
While flooding is a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve conditions in the Southwest, where drought is rife.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the second-highest category of severe droughts.
Hurricane Rosa will first reach the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 85 miles per hour (137 km/h). It is now 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 12 miles per hour.
A hurricane encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which causes it to weaken.
It's forecast to hit Mexico with tropical storm strength Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico could pose a major flood threat.
Weather.com reported that rainfall from 7 to 15 centimeters is expected in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, although it can reach 25 centimeters.
Then, Rosa will cross Mexico northward as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and by Tuesday evening, it will be making its way into southern Utah.
"The most serious threat posed by Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwest portion of Sonora State, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States", says the National Hurricane Center.
Rain is forecast to cause life-threatening flash floods and the displacement of pollutants into the desert and mud avalanches into the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, at approximately 4:00 AM (BST).
The victim was transported to the hospital and remains stable.
Avon and Somerset Police report that one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officers are asking anyone with video of the incident to contact us.
Trump said that Brett Kavanaugh "knew the meanness and the wrath of the Democratic Party"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous behavior of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has said that Kavanaugh "understood the contempt and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress, strongly and emotionally denying the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who claims that a man sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on the charges she was making.
On Saturday, the president said that it was a day when Americans could see Kavanaugh's brilliance, class and courage.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the greatest lawyers of our time, a jurist with great service to the community", he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running in this election, but I remain very active", he said.
I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates.
Trump says the Democrats are pursuing a policy of "resistance and obstruction".
According to an aide to a senior Republican politician, the first major Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them abducted by high waves crashing into beaches, after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu on Friday to participate in the city's festival, with waves as high as 20 feet [20 m] hitting the shore at dusk, carrying many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the danger emerged yesterday, the people on the beach did not flee immediately and were victims of the tsunami", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency BNPD, told a conference in Jakarta.
The Tsunami was attacking everything in its path, taking cars, logs and houses, Nugroho said, adding that before reaching the coastline, the element was moving at sea at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour.
He said some had climbed trees to save themselves and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Management Agency show many destroyed homes and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary earthquakes.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Utilization (BPPT), the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that some of the bodies of the victims were found under the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the coastline 300 kilometers north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, communication has been "completely paralyzed" and there are no reports from Donggala province.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers from the organization are going to the affected areas.
"We can now speak of a tragedy, although the situation could get much worse", the statement said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
Amateur video posted on social media shows a man shouting from a building, trying to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water broke against the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power outages, preventing communications within Palu, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city is open only for humanitarian aid and will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu.
More than 800 victims of the tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseba T. Sinay, World Vision's national director, the organization's staff reached Palu City safely from Donggala Province and found shelter in the brass tents in the office yard, passing through many devastated areas along the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly starting to deliver aid, there have been criticisms that experienced international aid workers are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, the acceptance of foreign funding, resources and personnel can only begin after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
"We are still officially dealing with a regional disaster", said a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government decides that there is a national disaster, we can start accepting international aid.
Two days after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and family members of the missing are still hoping that their loved ones will somehow find themselves among the devastation.
A little boy was pulled from the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paralympic team, trained two missing Paralympians at the Asian Games in Indonesia this month.
According to Petra Mandagi, the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paratrooper, I struggle with my own emotional burden", he declared.
Gendon Subandono told how within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse coming out in the paratrooper community, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to the athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a couple of blue hooks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling an ATM at the Newport on the Levee mall.
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was cashing in at the Newport on the Levee shopping center.
"The driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to replenish the cash", Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a released statement.
Another man ran from behind to the employee of Brink's and stole the bag with the money from the ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thief is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his decision on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: "Formerly known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time, which is also the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, during which he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who according to the creators, withdrew from the show for emotional reasons.
West has previously stated that the word Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
"I think that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ty", West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with a radio host nicknamed Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
First I was Kanye, which means one person, and now I'm Ye, reflecting all of our good, bad, and confused qualities.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
West was among the other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former associate, also wrote his nickname in various ways, with a prefix, without a prefix, and in capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledges not to use the military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, López Obrador vowed "never to use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to grow throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial aid to students and by creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into criminal groups.
The United States should double funding for AI research.
Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, says that as China's activity in the field increases, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The comment relates to announcements on artificial intelligence published by various US government agencies, although the US does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China unveiled its plan to become the most innovative country in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"First, we need to double the AI research budget: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area", said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funding could double the chances of another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chairman of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most significant artificial intelligence companies, known as Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that beat the then top American Othello player, and then he was a senior executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged the success of previous technology initiatives by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot designs, and asked about the date of the next edition of the challenge, as he believed it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that is taking away the best academics, it's the corporations", Lee said.
For several years now, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring top scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop AI.
"I think people who are working in AI and have gotten a PhD should be automatically given a green card", he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
Lee noted that the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a similar way to the US National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations that provide funding to US scientists, but the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion commitment to an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing over $100 billion a year in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to create a national AI security commission has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would end decades of conflict with Greece, which has blocked the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is home to the historic country of Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has therefore vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on the naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the vote, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum of 50% required to make the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: 'Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, say it is worth paying the price for Macedonia's possibility of joining organizations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted for the future of my country, so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have declared that they respect the results of the vote.
The name change requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said there were no unusual incidents reported as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout at this hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
"I voted for my children, because our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Joshe Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in the city of Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country's name to pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov set up a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kawardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaew says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote for the name change in the referendum because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO", Zaew said after the vote.
He said the "yes" vote was "a confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Research, 30 to 43 percent of voters said they would vote in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in Sunday's referendum.
70% of those surveyed said they would support changing the name.
To be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
A defeat in the referendum would be the first major blow to the policies of a pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeats the whole Brighton defence and takes the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home the Brighton defence in a 2-0 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal scored by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with a pass to the Argentine attacker in the middle of the field.
The footballer has overtaken three Brighton defenders.
Aguero then joined Brighton's four-man squad.
He first beat one of them, then overtook the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he played the ball to the left side, where Sterling was waiting for it.
The English striker immediately passed the ball back to Aguero in the penalty area, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
Aguero is struggling with a foot injury, Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We've been talking about the possibility of playing for 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky he got the goal in that time.
However, it was Sterling who secured the Blues' first ever Premier League double lead.
The goal in question came in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's half.
He sent a great pitch along the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to the far pole.
Manchester City's attacker put the ball in the net just before it hit the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies ' chances of winning .
After losing the playoffs to the Washington Nationals, Scherzer was not required to make the first team.
However, rivalry-loving Scherzer is hoping to play in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, if the Rockies can keep their chances of making the playoffs.
The Rockies can at least count on a wild card if they win Friday's game against the Nationals by a score of 5-2, but they're still looking to win their first division title.
Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to get on the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level as the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to be part of this meeting?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday's game, but the team is leaning toward Scherzer as a starter.
Scherzer's 34th appearance in the first team, he has attended the practice squad on Thursday and hopes to play on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA, 300 strikeouts and 220 2/3 innings this season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court justice, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the midterm presidential election.
In November, we'll put all the achievements we've made to the test.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
Even though I'm not running, I'm still very active, and I'm always defending our great candidates.
He then went on to say, "We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we are seeing their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to take power by any means possible.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control, but to gain power and control is their goal, and we're not going to give it to them.
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"It's been really good to see this over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "evil, vicious, unpleasant and untruthful".
The president addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with a loud roar from the crowd.
Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
What's that?
No, I mean, no, her body language was terrible, it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people expressing their opinions
When the Momentum activists in my party voted to give me a reprimand, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of Labour MPs who were recently told they were not welcome, and all because they were expressing their own opinions.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has faced similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for a reprimand was due to a disagreement between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences were about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and ironically, Jeremy Corbyn was opposed to the previous leaders' position on these issues.
The announcement on Friday of the meeting of Labour MPs from Nottingham East read: "We want meetings to be open and productive".
In my eight years as a Labour MP, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now held differently, and the promise of a 'more friendly and gentler' policy, if ever remembered, has long been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate dissent, and that every opinion is judged on its conformity with the party leadership.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took office, and colleagues who I thought shared the same views started to expect me to change course and take positions that I hadn't agreed with before, on issues like national security and the EU single market.
After every public speech  regardless of the content  I encounter attacks on social media calling for the withdrawal of the nomination, condemnation of centrism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment on a daily basis but do not shy away from taking action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current politics is the routine of insulting others.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views, and with every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules, the party's worldview is narrowing.
Over the last two years, I've been repeatedly advised to keep my mouth shut on certain issues, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student in the wake of the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government which led to the collapse of my school class, I have been trying to ensure better quality public services for people in need  both as a local councillor and a minister.
I never hid my beliefs, not even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and my disagreements with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday's motion, I cannot understand the willingness to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services.
But the most important message I have to send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour and others): I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or temporary political goals will deter me from acting in accordance with my convictions and in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr vs Melrose 38:17  undefeated Ayr again up
Two late additions could have somehow distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this very interesting Scottish extra league match.
The team is ranked first in the standings and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, it was the outstanding defense and the better use of the opportunity that led the home team to victory.
"The matches so far have been challenging for us, but we are still undefeated, so I am satisfied", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We have to pay tribute to Ayr because they've taken the opportunity better than we have.
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after a goal by Grant Anderson and a promotion by Frazier Clim, however a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who had joined from Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to tie the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused promotion opportunity.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking a penalty just before the end of the first half, first scoring a touchdown and then using the opportunity to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well, and Baggot's shot from Patrick Anderson cut the loss to five points.
After a long suspension due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, Ayr was sent off on the bench and after a resumption of the race, Ayr increased the lead with the addition of Stafford McDowall and the raising of Clim.
After Ayr's acting team captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, Melrose again used his numbers: a pass to an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for knocking out Clim without a ball, and MacPherson won a touchdown on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the opportunity to boost, and then again managed to boost the score just after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a penalty kick and allowed winger Gregor Henry to score a fifth for the hosts.
Still Game star starts his career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the TV series Still Game, seems to be starting his own business in the food industry, and it was recently discovered that he's become the CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, The Office, which he co-creates with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the show's history, and all indications are that Ford Kiernan is already planning for the future after leaving Craigslist.
According to official records, he became the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun insider suggested Kiernan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "growing food industry".
The sea is ours: Bolivia, deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the area of the naval base in La Paz.
Blue flags flying from public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval ports carry the following motto: "The sea is ours by law".
It's our duty to get him back.
In a landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, much like the dream of sailing across the Pacific again.
Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1st, after a five-year trial.
"Bolivia's actions are gaining momentum, and the people are unanimous, optimistic and hopeful for a favorable verdict", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague-based organization will recognize Bolivia's claim and, after decades of fruitless negotiations, will have to negotiate for an independent state with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president who will face a controversial re-election bid next year, is also hopeful for Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said in late August.
Some analysts, however, say that the chances of a favorable ruling for Bolivia are slim and that even a favorable ruling would make little difference.
The Hague-based United Nations body has no authority to grant Chile territory to Bolivia and has also reserved that it will not influence the outcome of any talks.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, said the International Court of Justice's decision would be issued six months after the final arguments were presented, a short period of time that shows that the case was "not complicated".
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years may have pushed the country further from its goal.
"The issue of access to the sea has been appropriated by the current Bolivian administration", Paz Zárate said.
Morales's relentless rhetoric has deprived Chileans of any remnants of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the current situation.
In both cases, no ambassadors have been exchanged since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will be Bolivia's "unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end a 139-year period of mutually beneficial disputes", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the issue of access to the sea as part of a political game.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The sentence is a great opportunity to convince ourselves that we need to deal with the past".
The rulers of North Korea say that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as they can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the "freeze" is that the lack of sanctions lifting and the US opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War has ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington refuses to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
There is, however, widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about eliminating the arsenal, which is seen by North Korea as the only measure to guarantee security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show heralds the arrival of the latest line of large head covers in clothing stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield yourself from the sun, we have good news for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of crazy, oversized head covers that will be part of their 2019 summer collection, which will shine with style during Paris Fashion Week.
The most unusual hats were on Instagram this summer, and the designers decided to showcase their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino's most distinctive work was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered circle that flooded the heads of the models.
Other super-dimensional accessories included gem-decorated watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple - but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed off a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter's style than haute couture.
One creature looked like scuba gear with a tube and glasses, and another looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break with the big fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that giant hats could be a hit in clothing stores.
The dimensional hats are right behind La Bomba, a straw hat with a 61-cm-wide round that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat, which has been leaking through social media, has unveiled another big creation - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it in her swimsuit.
A burning orange bag made of raffia, finished with raffia fringes and topped with a white leather handle, was featured in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the star designer, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to be in stores next summer because the designer has made such an impact, it would be hard not to capitalize on the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: language skills essential for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly celebrating their academic achievements  In 2018, they boasted further excellent test scores, supported by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other social endeavours.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools with over 30 000 pupils across Scotland strive to provide the best possible level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career paths and their role as global citizens.
As the education sector has the capacity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to another person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last examination this year show that languages are at the top of the league rankings, with the highest achievement rates occurring in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language scored higher than A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, language learning as an elective subject is taught in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent and non-selective school curricula.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that lack of language skills was the reason for the difficulties of jobseekers in filling vacancies in 17 per cent of jobseekers.
Language skills are therefore increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people for their career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills.
A lifelong skill such as learning a second language will provide a huge advantage in the future  regardless of the career path chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language where the percentage of people using it was two-digit, or 15%.
That's why investing in foreign language learning is so important for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, there will always be a wide range of languages to choose from in independent schools, taught by specialised teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed  no matter what the future holds.
Today, there is no denying that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a wide range of choice, diversity and level.
It's just the way it's supposed to be.
John Edward, chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans who wanted to see LeBron James debut with the Los Angeles Lakers finally got their way.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that LeBron James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a fraction of the minutes.
After a practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to play in preseason games to prepare", he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies Trump is planning for next week, including stops in places he's friendly to, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming the suspension of his election to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans may lose control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and where can you watch it online?
So, the Trump campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, is going to take place today at 7:00 p.m., which is Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So, the Trump campaign in West Virginia will be available to watch live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been held in tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated Senate vote to suspend the election for up to one week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to give support to Republicans facing a difficult November election.
So President Trump's campaign with five rallies next week is to mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House.
"Control of Congress is such a highlight on the president's schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible", said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
Today's rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey when the president comes to support him in the polls", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit, hoping to win the Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format on Saturday afternoon might have been what the Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating momentum oscillator is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that athletes really believe in, especially in events like this.
So what's their velocity at this point?
"They were six points ahead, and now they're only four, so I think we're a little bit ahead", said Jordan Spieth.
Europe is of course leading by four points, with 12 to go.
Americans, Spieth says, feel the wind in their sails and have role models to follow, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each boasted three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and setting an example.
The throat-thumping screams of excitement grew louder as his round went on, sinking the key putt and winning the game as he and Thomas scored two holes on two strokes.
His shot on the ground, which gave them a 15-point victory, was met with a similar "" cry, one that implies the American team is still in play.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players to score more points over the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legend.
The strange but lovely pair of European teams won four of the four and they were right.
The only couple who didn't score a bogey on a Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and back nine on Friday mornings, is the Hollywood couple.
The way they play and the way their energy seems to flow both into and out of the noisy crowd proves that these players need to be beaten on Sunday and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It's best if they play different holes at the same time.
It's too early to talk about a European team winning, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double double on the front nine kicked the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they'd never get out of.
Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead on the final day, but the foursome also showed that the US team has a fighting spirit that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe 10-6 including a lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 win in Saturday's fourball and foursome against the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead, taking two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing their previous Le Golf National score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to retain the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unseeded American team in the morning four-ball format, winning the series 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches but failing to make up for losses.
To retain the trophy, Jim Fury's team must score eight points from 12 singles matches to be played on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while along with Molinari (the team was renamed Molliwood after the sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball in great style, they beat the pumped-up Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more empathetic 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through two Saturday games, has occasionally shown flashes of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 games in the fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was not competing in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  who are ranked 1st and 3rd in the world rankings respectively.
But the European team was not at all happy on a pleasant, cold day in a field southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won decisively 2&1 over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team made up a four-point loss by starting a single, though Fury's team would have needed just a draw to retain the trophy.
But with the second-place finish two days ago, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea calls for unilateral disarmament without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said in a speech at the United Nations on Saturday that the failure to lift sanctions only deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States and there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"We don't see any concrete response from the US", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no question of unilateral disarmament of North Korea".
While Ri echoed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's reluctance to adopt a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps gradually, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as has happened in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim Jong-un pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is insisting on denuclearization first and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the signing of the 'end of war declaration,'" Ri said.
The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a figment of the human race that is behaving in a way that ignores us.
The problem is that the lack of sanctions increases our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the US leader had spoken about earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, and then added: "If the denuclearization party was South Korea, not the United States, then there would not be such a stalemate on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula".
Moreover, Ri's tone was completely different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile launch on US territory was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim Jong Un a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said there was much work to be done, and said that until North Korea was stripped of its nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for it, saying: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue and be continuous until we establish complete, final and verified denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and within hours, North Korea condemned him for "putting gangster demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon Jae-in this month to dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim Jong Un told him that the "appropriate measures" he wanted were the security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year gave all students more sleep to combat the growing macho culture of caffeinated students studying all night.
Academic students at the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course by giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"A girl came up to me after I finished and said, 'Why am I only being told this now, when I'm in my final year of college?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help them to perform well in school and athletics, and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the decision to introduce the course came after it was found that students had suffered from severe sleep deprivation for a week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section includes a room in the dorm where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know about the health effects of smoking, Professor Scheisler added.
The culture of pride in "all-night learning" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
Giving students enough quality sleep should be their secret weapon against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which keeps the student hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he says, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving on to a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set alarms to remind them when to go to bed and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic devices and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers , the Gerrard team takes down the Mena
The Rangers suffered another loss in the Livingston outing when Dolly Meng's shot led the dismantled team of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox Stadium side were looking to record their first win since their 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader  Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of commitment didn't seem to improve.
While Rangers recorded a drop to sixth, Livingston climbed to third - just behind Hibernian with a goal loss.
The Rangers may be in further trouble with the need to treat linebacker Calum Spence's head wound after he was hit by an object thrown from the visitors' stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed them to overtake Ayr and advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went through with the same Livingston XI that took the Hearts' point last week, being delighted at the way his well-trained team tortured their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but it was the Livingston team that did more with the ball once they had it.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first delivery allowed Scott Pittman to face Alan McGregor's goal, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then threw a deep free throw to captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow playing at fullback could only stay in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he deserved a penalty kick 15 minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
Rangers were only able to deliver two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely worried by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a weak shot from Ovie Eary.
While Livingston's 34th-minute goal in the opening game might have been counterproductive, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort put into it.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle the deep, steady piece of play that Jacobs had done.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm, passing it to Mengi for a simple finish.
Gerrard did not waste the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The switch almost immediately affected the winger, who threw the ball at Morelos, but an impressive Kelly managed to block it by running from his position.
The Livingston team continued to pull the guests into the game exactly as they liked, as Lithgow and Halkett made long passes one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor was well ahead of Jacobs, after which Lithgow put the game away from the corner.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton was once again hoping for a penalty kick when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes away again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882 - 136 years ago - the day the future German physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a part of both science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
What the hell is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these on, you'll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.
I can hear something now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" enemy cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the enemy cells as part of the treatment.
This method involves removing the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" a protein that's common to many cancers, and then they're injected back into the body.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received a vaccine that trained her immune system to recognize enemy cells had a remission of ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ' detect' a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that this vaccine works very well.
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and learning how to locate them in cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West is going to a pro-Trump rally on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was "bubbled" in the studio during Saturday Night Live after he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song, "Ghost Town", that night, wearing a "Make America Great" hat, he made a speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
Every time I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump?
If I cared about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before a Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, the video of West's interview was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by posting.
Also, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had trouble with his hat.
They've been after me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They're all over me!
And then they say I have no choice, he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You're saying I have no choice?" and he added, "I'm going to put on a Superman shirt so you can't tell me what to do.
Let's just accept it.
His words twice caused a buzz in the audience, and members of the SNL crew looked confused, reports Variety.
West was invited to the show to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with his rendition of "I Love It" disguised as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR BEING MAFIA".
Talk show host Karen Hunter said on her Twitter that West was just being himself and that was absolutely great.
"However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
"We are free, too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "formally" Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, however, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper friend, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed his name to Symbol, and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge in the stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is due to appear in the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is raising the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit out at the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen makes young boys often think they have to play tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something had gone wrong and he was wondering how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels "quite confident" about raising the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point where we've made a mistake on the subject of masculinity", he said.
What did we teach men as they grew up, in terms of the problem we face today?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity because of the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: "What attitudes are innate, and what are learned?
What is being taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to take a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time  what can we do to change this?
Clearly, there's something wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be playing in any more Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ended the following year, saying he was "over the battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his thieving brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that has ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"On the set I met my wife, which gave me my future family and a new life", he said.
In this multiple Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte  the object of the love interests of the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14 percent increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to the country's health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted sexually, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made HIV medicines available to all as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that any member of her team has leaked Republican Senate records. It's a "dangerous lie" and a "conspiracy theory".
U.S. House of Representatives Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were made by experts and websites linked to the far-right.
"Lies, lies and even more vicious lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information leaked online on Thursday was posted by an unknown person at the Capitol during a Senate hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators challenged Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of Waters' team , as Hill says.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and 100% false", Waters continued.
 A member of my team  whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations  was in no way responsible for the leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and it is 100% a lie.
Waters's statement quickly sparked criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This kind of denial is wrong", Fleischer wrote.
It suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be wrong.
He can't provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the person making the accusation.
But he must remain calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of exhibiting excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Tough case, if that's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations".
"The plaintiffs will be exposed and held accountable for all their actions that pose a threat to any of my team", she said.
Johnny English: Knock-out spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in any new British film has become the norm, and this seems to be the case with the new installment of the Johnny English action/comedy film series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to theaters in 2011 with Johnny English: Revival.
Will the self-deprecating satire about how hopeless we are become the country's new export?
In any case, the perpetually surprised, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has been re-licensed for distribution  his name and surname signal more than anything else that he is a large, comic work for non-English speaking audiences.
He's obviously a stupid secret agent who, despite his weird liking for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Jassia Fasoli, and a little bit of this guy adding one note to the theme tune of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also a traveller and a world-renowned mystery man. Atkinson once starred in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left a mess behind.
There's one or two notable moments in the latest Johnny English movie.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing medieval armor, while the rotor blades beat rhythmically against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is clearly visible on screen, but his sense of humor seems to be rather low-key and unnecessary, especially now that even "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy elements as an integral part of the film.
The humor seems to be aimed more at children than adults. I don't think Johnny English's crazy adventures are as ingenious and consistent as the gags in Atkinson's silent films about Jasi Fasola.
The current assumption has always been that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents operating in the field to the horror of an operative on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last straw in the prime minister's spell of bitterness, who is a pompous, wasted character already suffering from a nervous breakdown due to lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can to play Theresa May, but the script does not allow her to develop her wings.
Her advisers at the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identities of all active spies, she will have to reinstate one of the retired agents.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, currently employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent  some good gags while giving English spy lessons.
English is called to Whitehall for a check-up, reuniting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man connected to the submarine commander, a cheerful but somewhat weary character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service team up again, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously possessed by a charismatic tech-crazed billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems - the man is the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade with absurd situations: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking aboard the luxury yacht Volta; and English sows havoc while using the virtual reality set to explore the interior of Volta's home.
In this last scene, all the restrictions are removed, but despite the pleasant and loud performance, the whole film is very much like children's television.
You know, the average guy.
As with the other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly matched his talent?
Labour denies that it is working on a plan to provide a four-day work week for the British, for which they will be paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby British people will work four days a week and get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of pay.
Sources say the idea is part of the party's economic program and plans to take the country to the workers.
The move to a four-day workweek was supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changing the economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: "A change in policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year".
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is something that fits into the party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea  The Greens have pledged to introduce a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all Labour members.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered".
John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he's determined to take back power from the faceless CEOs and the "speculators" in public utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not recover their entire stake, as the Labour government could make "calculations" based on detected fraud.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and to set up integrated equity funds to transfer 10 per cent of private-sector equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the question on 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and has raised questions about whether the Bureau's findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday with 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
On the way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the charge came out, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was firm, decisive and unambiguous.
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be set in stone.
"I made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it, you need a strong indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people who claimed it could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty in any way?
Next Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival will be an annual music event that boasts an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
The seventh annual Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy performances by stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the event's most important goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that works to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they chose to buy a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or activities such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful activities that helped raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast in the 12 years that remain to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to get them to demand action, or is it just another case of what's called cliqueism, where people feel like they're doing something important by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by people supporting the campaign since 2011, aiming to achieve a wide range of goals.
It also says that these efforts have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least US$10 billion had already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the security has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and developers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after Global Citizen members sent over 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past". Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition Ambassador, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website was, "How can you be sure that you will be able to end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded as follows: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with all the great civil rights movements and anti-apartheid movements of our time, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports
Washington may "require" its navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing into markets, including those in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria  especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is to mediate in the energy trade, as they do in Eastern Europe", he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability through its navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels", he said, comparing Russia to a "Kuccinian with one trick" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The comments come as the Trump administration continues its mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe  which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unworkable" Nord Stream 2 project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the implementation of this project is solely due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States' position provoked a strong reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said she'd consider running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At the meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, including the woman in the highest office", she told The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll consider running for president.
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren without a garden has voiced her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who chose "probably" said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted for the nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick  38 percent of people supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent were against it.
Other notable names from the Democratic camp being considered for potential 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin is talking about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the Trump campaign.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming home with", she told the audience at Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest "a taboo subject", and then she said of her son and other war veterans: "They come back a little changed, they come back aged, they come back wondering if they'll be shown respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all the other military members have given of themselves to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, soliciting false testimony in a domestic violence report, and possessing a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and his brutal gang-banged sons had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors from the states that supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have a high number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries that are facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle", the amicus curiae letter said.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they can become entrepreneurs and "create a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - even the serious ones - that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance brings in the bodies.
There's no clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching the water-soaked property and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake quickly became overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to the severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was squeezed into the rubble of the wall. Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, then her voice went quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of harassing with propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid-for China Daily in the Des Moines Register  the most popular newspaper in Iowa  accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6  China denies this charge.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election confirmed what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise their countries' trade with each other, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and a longtime governor of Iowa and a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China is now doubling down on harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
But there will be no voice of opposition in a Beijing street kiosk, and there will be no real reflection of the differing opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic direction, given that the media is under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are fighting each other over women's suffrage ahead of the midterm elections over the Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, an analyst warns that members of the House will face a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotion of this event is tremendous, and most Republicans are already officially going to vote.
"There is no turning back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona)'s efforts to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it until November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming" as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber against the decision by Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of scale", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told one news site.
People say he was tall anyway, and it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to endorse her, it could be met with a backlash.
"The Republican Party has to deal with a lot of mess", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told a news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe in the face of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having slightly more support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI has launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party while he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with the platforms of Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with the platforms of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt is "World domination".
"We have to do it now", he said, referring to the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own 'online store with personal data' or otherwise POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of an online store of personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid's platform accessible to all people.
Now the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world were able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will overnight turn their entire business models upside down.
I'm not asking their permission.
In a post posted on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been heavily involved in the debate over net neutrality.
In establishing Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely excited about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: awarded the Victoria Cross for his service during World War I
The memory of the only Church of England clergyman who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combat soldier during World War I was commemorated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on 29 September 1918 for his raids on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled to his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the unveiling of the stone on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's award was "extremely symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal, "in very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and "with the greatest courage" led it forward, then single-handedly attacked the field army positions, disabling three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never cope with, but at the same time something humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath at the end of the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured" to be able to participate in the parade, adding that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he receives from so many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 gala, and instead they got Piggy Peppas.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrill-packed Bellator 206 gala and ultimately not being able to see the main event.
The San Jose gala program featured 13 fights, including six on the main menu, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in the UK were shocked by the change to Piggy Peppas.
Some were disappointed after staying up early in the morning just to watch the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a sick joke".
"According to government regulations, this type of content is not suitable to be shown at 6 a.m., so it was necessary to switch to a children's program", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
Pep's pig, yeah.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they're revising the schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about the situation happening again, I think we can fix it", Coker said.
But it's Sunday morning, so we won't be able to deal with it until Sunday, our time, and Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program change happened there, we got a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't a malfunction. It was a legal issue.
I can promise you, this will never happen again.
We're going to narrow it down to five fights instead of six, which is the standard amount, because we were too keen to please the fans, and unfortunately we overdid it.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt worse about his sexuality
Tom Daley, Olympic diver, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that being a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this long-running program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on the show for the first time hosted by Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
He said: "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different is what gives me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove he was worth something so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out he was sexual.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a vocal LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak out because he was happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and he wanted to give hope to others in this way.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with the man he met in 2013 - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - surprised him.
Daley married the Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
"When you go through so much at such a young age", he said, referring to his first Olympic Games at 14 and his father's death from cancer three years later, "he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs".
The couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said it completely changed his perception of certain things.
"Last year, the most important thing for me was to win the gold medal", he said.
And you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not coming with us to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life", he said. "Jumping into the water in front of a crowd at the Olympics was the best feeling I've ever had".
It also inspired him to choose the first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and still makes him goose-pimp.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson showing no form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson of the United States will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to work on his form to keep his mark.
Mickelson, playing in his 12th appearance in the biennial event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Furyke for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as was often the case with his U.S. team, the five-time major winner had to spend the day doping the team and working on improving his game in the hope of fixing the reason he was sent back to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who never delivered the easiest shots, even at the peak of his career, is not doing well on the tight Le Golf National, where misses are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field alone isn't enough to discourage Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (who lost by four points in the first 12 singles) start the game with a bang, Mickelson's game could prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player. He couldn't do anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, took my hand and said he would be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He's very confident.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to his teams' game both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's what happened and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, like everybody else.
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, and Furyk said his presence has brought a lot to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, mocking, and it's good to have him in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings so much more than just games.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big points advantage could soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the start of singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama Field, where he and his assistant captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but he missed the finish line by the shortest possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and we won by a hair", Bjorn said in the photo after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, giving a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Time will show me and everyone else on this team that it's not over.
Tomorrow, you're going to do your best.
Get out there and do everything right.
The end is not until the dots appear on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said from the beginning that I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are.
Bjorn, impressed by how his players handled the difficult field, added: "I couldn't have done it better.
But tomorrow is different.
Tomorrow's the singles, and that's another matter.
It's good to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
That's the message you have to give to the players, to give your best tomorrow.
A partner must also give his best.
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to score better singles than they do in a partner game, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced a major twist on the final day as a member of the winning team at the Brooklyn Field, then suffered a defeat after the European team performed a "miracle" at the Medina Field.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up his players for the final day's fight.
We've got 12 big games tomorrow, and you'd like to start the game at a fast pace, like we did at the Brooklyn and Medina fields.
If this momentum goes one way, it's gonna put a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We've set our lineup and set the boys up in a way that will allow us to enchant tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with leading the counter-attack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter - the other European team players - in the top half of the schedule.
"I decided on this group of guys in this order because I think they're going to do well throughout the games", Bjorn said of his single choices.
New German warship delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate is due to enter service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and alarmingly rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was to be commissioned in 2014, but problems arose after delivery and required changes to this ambitious design.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-rotor missiles, and technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance  new frigates should be able to operate for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete by the time they enter service  reports Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the causes behind the turnaround, but the German media reported a number of key software and hardware "faults" that rendered the ship useless for combat missions.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of around 120 seamen, half the size of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was far too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Navy to carry out future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the whole project  including crew training is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3,1 billion (USD 3,6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2,2 billion.
The problems with the commissioning of new frigates are particularly acute in the light of recent warnings that the strength of the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was running out of ships that could be used.
He also said that the problem was exacerbated over time by the decommissioning of old vessels without providing replacement vessels.
He also expressed his dissatisfaction that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be incorporated into the fleet.
The National Trust is listening in on the secret lives of bats
A new study on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at showing how bats use the landscape to forage.
It is hoped that the results of the study will shed new light on the conservation of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will study dwarfs and small ones, as well as long-eared brown bats and bats from the family of red bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out field tests using portable detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings is done by experts to determine the frequency of the signals sent by bats and the behaviour of the individual species.
A habitat map and a report will then be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the findings will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which has an impact on the beams and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose a threat, as can fly glue and certain chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their nocturnal habits make their ears more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to look for worms and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It is composed of ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, check storms, and sometimes even conduct rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the property manager, says it's the perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a great bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and fine settlements.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, and the work we're doing here and in other farms will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
It stresses the importance of bat control before any conservation work is undertaken on the holdings, as accidental destruction of one bat can kill up to 400 females and young, potentially leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected  killing, harassing or disturbing them or destroying their nest is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, has urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don't even know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges while his lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel, the footballer was to pay the woman $375,000 for keeping quiet.
Ronaldo, 33, hours after the allegations were announced, in an Instagram live message to his 142 million followers, described the reports as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
Today's news is fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new about this.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
"I'm happy and everything is fine", the footballer added with a smile on his face.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine over allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek moral damages in the amount of the weight of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorgo reportedly went to the soccer player's room, where he allegedly raped a woman anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99% a good guy who was deceived by the 1%
According to the records, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she still can't get over the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying a fee of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain would forever regret leaving carmakers
Britain would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after leaving the European Union, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "concerned" when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
A spokesman for the Japanese carmaker said the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, then there will be a shutdown of production at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is going to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are  as claimed by car manufacturers  the supply chain risks of the UK leaving the European Union without a deal.
Toyota's production line operates on a 'just-in-time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be difficulties at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and parts shortages.
According to a company spokesman, Toyota would not be able to last more than one day without supplies to its Derbyshire plant, which would halt production.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely structured to avoid border control".
"We need a deal, we want to reach the best possible deal that will not only allow us to enjoy the success we have but also allow us to make the most of the situation", he told BBC Radio 4 today.
'The statements made not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue what has been a very efficient set of supply chains'.
The representative of Toyota was unable to say for how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the Unite works council, said that union members are increasingly concerned: "I know from experience that if jobs are lost, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union'.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed another week" because of the ongoing battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's close associates and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was about to resign.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, and the meeting was postponed to avoid interfering with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has been set for this meeting, it could be this week or it could be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll definitely let the press know.
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of press conferences is not due to a hatred of "stantiated" TV journalists, and then added: "I'm not going to hide that they are "stantiated".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current president is holding more Q&A sessions than any other president before him", she said, adding without providing evidence, "We've got the numbers".
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if journalists can ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's a much better solution than talking to me.
We're trying to do this regularly, and we've done this very often over the last few weeks, and press conferences will be given up as a way to have a session where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with host dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why by acting too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the assembled press.
The Health Minister writes to EU staff employed by NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to EU workers employed by the Scottish Health Service to express their country's gratitude and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of processing applications for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union continued last year and the relevant decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we very much want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone surgery for a head injury sustained in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in a 31-27 Tennessee loss, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He walked to the sideline, then he leaned on the ground", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed him on stretchers and carried him out for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he has no details yet on the type/size of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a sophomore exempt from representing the university for a year to hone his skills) is playing his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five sacks on Saturday before the game, which gives him 18 sacks this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying property in the UK
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers will be charged higher tax on the purchase of property in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless.
This move is designed to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a younger electorate.
The tax increase will cover people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury estimates that this will raise up to £120 million a year for homelessness relief.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged a higher tax rate, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to lure the younger electorate with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden on the higher earners.
Higher tax rates will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional funds are intended to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee  charged in addition to the current tax, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and apartments purchased for rent  may be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to rising prices and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
As many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy regions, especially the capital, have become ghost towns.
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big developers of keeping property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits on cheap housing to end the UK's "housing scandal".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including the regulation of rents and an end to evictions without cause.
It also wants to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said that as Prime Minister I would be committed to rebuilding the British dream of making every generation's life better than the last.
It also means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it's not right that people who don't live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy property here as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become a distant one, but the humiliation of having to spend the night on the street remains all too real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to become Scotland's national team coach".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's national team coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is committed to the recovery of the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, three points behind the top-flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I only managed to get to the B-frame", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
As a child, I used to watch the Scottish games with my father in Hampden and I was always attracted to it.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed as the club's coach.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he is not dismayed to take on the role of such a prominent figure at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now, success will be measured to me by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities available, it is undoubtedly its place.
It won't be easy to do, but I'll probably feel like I've succeeded here, if I can.
Ross's coaching career has only lasted three years, having previously been an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month member of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa win promotion back to the third tier after relegation, and the following season led St Mirren from relegation to the Championship.
Jack Ross says he's much more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point", said Alloa, "to take over as coach.
I really believed that running a team was a much better fit for me than just playing.
It may sound strange, but as a player I was doing well, earning well, and achieving some measurable success.
But acting is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week, you have to go through different situations.
I still have them when it comes to the stress and pressure of coaching, but I feel good about myself in that role.
I've always wanted to coach, and I'm doing it now, and I can say that I feel more at home right now than I have in my entire adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th on Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
Research shows the best time to drink beer is 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a surge in British pubs, but it hit the restaurant chains hard.
Research shows that pub and bar sales rose 2.7 percent in July, but restaurants fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consultancy CGA, which produced the data, said: "The continued heat and England's longer-than-expected World Cup appearance have caused the July results to be similar to June, when pub turnover rose by 2.8 per cent, with the difference that restaurant earnings fell even further.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June was further compounded in July.
Drink-serving pubs and bars fared best  their sales growth outpaced the decline in restaurants.
Food-serving pubs also suffered during the heat, though not as much as restaurant owners.
It seems people were just thirsty.
Beverage sales in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, and food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman of the entertainment and tourism analyst firm RSM says: "These results are consistent with the trend we have been observing since the end of April.
The most important factors influencing the size of out-of-home consumption remain weather and large sporting or social events.
The fact that the restaurant chains are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although the 4.8% decline in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences when considering the continuing pressure to reduce costs.
The long, hot summer has come at the worst possible time for food service owners, and time will tell whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed respite.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion, setting recognised industry standards.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted on the sites.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - set up social networking accounts that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in primary schools showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts  the name refers to the photo-sharing service Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that these accounts are being used to post sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that they have a "main" account that they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One mother, who happened to be on the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenager who was encouraging others to rape her.
A survey of independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, says: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are creating their own places on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
At the annual general meeting of Scottish Athletics' management Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her rich international experience gained over the past decade.
'Eilidh is held in high regard by the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that her appointment to the board will be a great benefit to Scottish athletics,' said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very pleased to be able to give the board the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can really help to manage sport in Scotland".
An American who, among his four Olympic gold medals, won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert, is unable to walk as a result of a transient bloodless attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would regain my fitness and to what extent.
It was a painful job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and went back to training!

An advertisement for lactators that compares mothers to cows is causing extreme emotions on the Internet
A company that makes milk bottles caused a stir on the Internet by running an ad that compared breast-feeding mothers to milked cows.
To announce the launch of the "world's first silent breast milk underwear", its manufacturer, Elvie, released a derisive video ad that highlighted the freedom it provides mothers.
It shows four real mothers dancing in a haystack to a song that includes the words: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not just my boobs".
And the chorus goes like this: "Pump it, pump it, I'll feed the children with it, pump it, pump it, I'll breast-feed my ladies".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a huge controversy online.
The video currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, with users expressing extreme opinions, many of whom say it's inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that's happening in the dairy industry.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, with their babies being taken away from them a few days after birth.

Another person commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
Right, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their babies.
Another added: "This ad is completely detached from reality".
Others defend the video. One of the women stated that she thought the song was "funny".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I was pulling food out.
The commercials are a little crazy, but I'm not looking for the bottom line.
It's a brilliant invention. Someone wrote it.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who are cutting food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows".
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.
At the end of the film, we see women dancing with their breast pumps discreetly attached to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
However, Elvie's lactator is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be carried unnoticed under a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies in their arms, and even leave the house while feeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: "Elvie's Lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the nursing women and the dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges of draining food, while also presenting in a fun and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator has made the headlines.
At London Fashion Week, during the Marty Jakubowski show, a mother of two showed up with this product on the runway.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month is virtually unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who fear they could be deported if they claim the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults living on the joint farm would be fingerprinted and then handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had reported themselves as sponsors of children left unattended.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior record.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or live with them in the same household are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we're always after them", Albence said.
Shelter workers say that in an effort to speed up the settlement of the children's situation, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as was the case under previous standards.
A lot of people will be coming in via videoconference, not in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for parole will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbursts of aggression or attempted escape.
Advocates said the problems are even more serious in larger centers like Tornillo, where the size of the center makes it easier to ignore signs that something is wrong with the child.
They also said that moving children to a tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can add to the trauma many of them are already dealing with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "we will deal with them accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the Assembly.
Moualem says the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He says Damascus will continue to "fight its holy battle" until it clears Syria of both terrorist groups and "all foreigners living there illegally".
Currently, there are approximately 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, primarily engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
And there are still over 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused some Western countries of "inciting irrational fear" that discouraged them from returning.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns", he said.
They politicize matters that should have a purely human dimension.
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad reaches a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has opened the way for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear timeframe" and expressed hope that the military action will be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Levant People's Defense Front, who will be "eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new commission composed of members of the ruling party and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be re-elected for a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are probably hoping, his presidency ends early with impeachment and scandal.
It would be, without question, the most dramatic end to the presidency.
So far, there's no sign of any spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC's  has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at its peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the highest ratings of any cable news program, with 3.5 million viewers watching its evening newscasts.
"People fly like moths to the fire". "This is something we don't understand", said Neal Bear, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an accomplished comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She remembers riding a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh", he said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, the news from Washington could be more important than anything else on television to determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the legality of family reunification, or the state of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts at six o'clock debate Bob Woodward's use of secret informants in writing his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, or the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Stormy Daniels.
I'm never gonna look at Super Mario like I used to.
"What he does is partly like a reality show in that he delivers new content every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and daily twists of the Trump show (such as attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be behind schedule.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north shore of Kauai, where he lives, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in question.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.

The inflow of outside money for the congressional campaign.
Not surprisingly, after the redistricting, which now puts two incumbents in the race for one seat, a river of cash flows into Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in Congress by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The district maps were adjusted after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled that the old districts had been unfairly designated, giving a Republican advantage and was unconstitutional.
The race for the new 17th district began with a campaign finance battle between the main party funding bodies  the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in the widely-commented election for the 18th Congressional District in March.
The seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but it backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite a slight objection from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varella, and until the expulsion of the Trump Organization management team by partners, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to dismiss the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the recent decision to stop recognizing Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
The sanctions were only intended to apply to El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in 2017 in aid, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial aid and visas for certain individuals, would be very severe for the Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address the conclusions of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now, at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak, signaling an invitation to the administration's representatives to meet.
Three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for John Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst from the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
Another element may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which concrete evidence is now publicly available.
According to reports, the Robert Mueller investigation is also looking into whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the US election.
If the makeup of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparation for his re-appearance before the electorate, and possibly even tried by a jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump or his peers in Europe is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have a choice to make that will decide how long this can go on.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It failed, and we lost the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing the inevitable march of democracy.
There are several turning points for the Americans right now.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller's investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since our paper revealed that he offered a secret recording of the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
What do we do if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, in the middle of the presidential term, will we elect the people in Congress who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, we're going to have a hard time with democracy.
But I believe we will because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on that swastika-marked table.
With such a legacy, how could I not look to the future with optimism?

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is looking forward to the Rapid Vienna game.
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw with Villareal in Spain this month, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the Europa League Group G.
Until the 2-2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury prevented assistant manager Graham Dorrance from playing this season, but he believes this result will act as a springboard for Rangers to achieve greater success.
"It's been good for us because Villarreal are in good shape", said the 31-year-old.
We went to this game with the belief that we could accomplish something and we won the point.
Maybe we could have pushed them in the end, but overall, a draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half, we were better.
As for Thursday, it's another big night for Europe.
We hope to get three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent has made a good score in his last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will pass and win a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with all the things about my injury and the changes at the club itself, but now we all feel good about ourselves.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play, and the training is going well.
I hope we can move on, put the last season behind us and succeed.
The fear of retirement savings makes women sleepy
Although those surveyed knew exactly how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family.
In a Nationwide survey, about half of the respondents said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", said Holly Snyder, senior vice president of Nationwide, a life insurance company.
Where do I start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your will.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how you would like to be cared for, as this choice will be an important factor in determining the cost.
Ask a financial adviser: He or she can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid policy that provides cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets if you have one.
Prepare the legal documents, you'll avoid a court battle.
Appoint a trusted health care representative to oversee and ensure that the appropriate people follow your wishes should communication become impossible.
Consider also hiring a trustee to handle the finances.
Choose someone you trust, for they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Consider the following: Imagine that your elderly parent needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information you need to have it ready.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are", Martin asks.
What medication are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan like that.

He was in his 40s near Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police have described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking for witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala caubaton, which is located north of Palu, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Palu disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and Donggala on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck as the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupaten (lower-level administrative unit than a province) stretching along the northwest coast of the island for over 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it had 299,200 inhabitants.
The main economic sectors of Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal Donggala Cabapaten.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mines, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have struck Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami struck Donggala, killing over 200 people and destroying hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami in western Donggali killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh Province, causing devastation and panic among people who still remember the devastation caused by the fatal 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but the collapsing buildings killed over 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They have caused the destruction of thousands of homes and temporary inconvenience to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when the suspect's friend tried to call the police to report the crime, he took her phone.
KTUU is reporting that Palin is being held in Mat-Su's detention center and has a $500 bond outstanding.
According to her, he appeared in court last Saturday, where he stated in his defense that she was "certainly innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Claims.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's aggressive behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder he developed while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds killed by tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the central part of Celebes Island, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of the disaster are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were on the beach in Palu, where the festival was being held.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, suspected of carrying out the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
For the attack, which took place in October on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to drive pedestrians and cyclists off his route.
According to a notice filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injury to justify the death penalty.
According to the court document, both charges carry the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of murder in the course of illegal activity, which is the procedure typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "solid planning and deliberation" and the way Saipov carried it out was described as "malign, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused harm, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine citizens who were in New York City on tourism.
The last time the death penalty was introduced in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in September 2009.
The death penalty in a federal case was last carried out in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whose marriage was annulled after they were convicted two years earlier of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse for months after the attack.
Police say he told investigators he felt fine about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired to attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police say he also demanded an ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He's pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of theft.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought to all concerned", he said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
At today's protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must have felt the "heat" from eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that she should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would be out of the EU.
However, the Tories' joining the separate anti-Brexit protest in the city, which was a staying-in-the-country drive, further underlined the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks that lay before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her compromise plan with Chequers amidst attacks from the pro-Brexit, the anti-Brexit and the EU itself.
Her allies say she will push for a deal with Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her proposal and chaos.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull that he wants to "throw out the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be the proxy, who should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had done this, we'd be out of the EU by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers plan".
He said: 'We did not fight in the world wars to be subject to someone.
We want to assert our rights in our own country.
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since voting in 2016: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue'.
Also at the rally was pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns of the Tories, who told reporters: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, neither our party nor our activists who populate the streets and who elected us, support it either.
Drop the Chequers plan and start listening.
In her address to the Prime Minister, May added: "Prime Ministers hold their positions when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage said that politicians taking part in the demonstration must feel "hot" if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we're not going to let you do that.
Addressing the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to make the politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, who gave us the victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the anti-Brexit protesters marched through the city centre for a two-hour demonstration.
A handful of activists waved Tory anti-Brexit banners after the group formed this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues with the party's app at the start of the conference.
"These are people who say they can organize the IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada Plus Plus plan, a smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit.
Elizabeth Warren is planning to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, a Massachusetts Democratic congresswoman spoke about her future during a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Elizabeth Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November, and will face Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair during the 2016 election.
Now, there's talk that Warren could defeat Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and she meant women at the top.
The arrest of the perpetrator of the fatal shooting that killed LSU player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytone Simpson during a conference call that took place at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time.
A video of the shooting was released Friday with a request for help in identifying the man seen on it.
20-year-old Wayde Sims was shot and killed outside the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gunshot wound, resulting in his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters, according to 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun and shooting Wayde.
After an arrest in which he did not resist, he was transferred to the custody of the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 6-foot-3, 205-pound junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played in 32 games, starting 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team-mandated victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team's bid would have a big impact on the race.
Bottas, who started from the first pitch, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to drive in the tail of the peloton, which should decide the course of the race.
The Mercedes driver came to the pits on the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a round-trip action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking being pushed to the defensive after a double move by the rival to defend his position at the third corner, Hamilton moved into the lead.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap, he was seventh.
He then led for much of the race by not changing the tyre to make a quick finish and take fourth place from Kimi Raikkonen.
He finally reached the service point on lap 44, but he failed to accelerate for the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen taking fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had been doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when I told him to let me through.
"The whole team did everything they could to get the first two places", Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianna Feinstein, who claimed she had not released a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Christine Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "wicked, malicious and lying".
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we've been witnessing for the last few days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, malicious and lying", he said.
We see what's been published and disclosed, and then they tell us, "Wow, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
You remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you disclose this?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the contents of that document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't tell her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we disclose... No, we didn't disclose", he added, scratching the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the contents were leaked in early September.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story", Feinstein testified before the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to be discreet, and I did not disclose the contents of the letter.
Her statement, however, did not convince the president, who commented during the meeting on Saturday: "I tell you, it was really bad flesh language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen in my life.
Continuing his defense of a Supreme Court nominee who was accused by three women of sexual assault, the president suggested that Democrats are using the insinuation to their own ends.
They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
"You can see the meanness, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars and Belfast Giants five to one
In the game against Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars have made up for their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday, winning a rematch at home on Saturday, 5-3
The Giants quickly gained a two-point lead after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score, and then Dwyer again led the Giants.
Francois Bouchard again tied the score, scoring for Dundee, and two goals by Lucas Lundvald Nielsen sealed the victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's supporters, who despite an initial loss on Friday night, won against Dundee in Belfast 2-1.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season, with the Giants winning their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal was scored in the fourth minute (3:35) by Kendall McFaul, and four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score with an assist from David Rutherford.
After an intense opening at 1:10 p.m., Sullivan brought the home team back into play, and then Matt Marquardt tied the score at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first period when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The hosts were re-arranged and Bouchard again equaled the score with a goal from the lead at 27:37.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen secure Dundee's first ever lead in the match, and the final Dundee victory was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored his team's fifth goal.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on a plane escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died helping to take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The area is still experiencing strong aftershocks, and many people have been trapped in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the shaking air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air plane (flight 6321), which was on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the tower when it seemed like it was going to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the controller's decision probably saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We arranged for a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan in Borneo to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news has torn our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the National Disaster Management Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe the death toll is still increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The tsunami's six-meter waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral for the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are delivering aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies in.
We're running out of drinking water.
Small shops are being looted.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find on the ground.
It's a tragedy, and it could be worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu, addressing the military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN.
This year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airlines that operated the flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific have reported one person missing, and earlier said all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said it had no information on Saturday afternoon on the number of men who were travelling on the feral plane.
They said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airlines said there were six passengers still in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the crash, nor is the exact course of it known.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off his belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was coming very low.
"It helped us a lot", he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the water that reached the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew members were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to modernize the coast were also helping with the rescue, and they were able to transport people to shore in a blown-up boat before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but that does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded the presentation of evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spent many hours testifying as a forensic expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she was killed.
According to the Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers that night, thus disproving his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that at the time Quinton was allegedly staying with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was in Jessica Chambers' possession, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another inaccuracy is Tellis's claim that he'd known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted her phone contact information, along with her text messages and phone calls.
"He's been cutting her out of his life", Hale said.
The closing arguments are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would probably be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed  what is hip-hop conscious?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
According to Bristol-based group The High Breed, today's hip-hop has moved away from its original political and social themes.
The band members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
With artists like Akala and Lowkey, there's been a recent resurgence in the UK of artists like The Fugees and Common.
Another black one?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing them after a racist text message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her from her job on the grounds of racism after receiving a wrongly-addressed text message from the baby's mother complaining that she is "a cool black person".
The couple denied being racist, likening the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was clearly appalled when it was revealed that her new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, who was reluctant to show up for her first day of work in 2016, is black.
"Nee, another black person" she texted her husband.
But instead of sending it to him, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the omission, she fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that the warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, was misbehaving and expected a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home by Uber.
She is now seeking compensation from the couple for $350 per day of leave multiplied by the six months she was originally employed with the residence, even though she did not sign the contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the termination of their relationship with Ms. Maurice was justified because after they had insulted her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racists", said Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
Would you trust your children to someone you hurt, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, you guys.
Comparing the lawsuit to blackmail, Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna blow something like that up?
"That's not very nice", added the investment banker.
Although the court case is not yet over, the public opinion quickly passed a verdict on the couple on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of the Paddington books were concerned that readers would not feel connected to the talking bear
The author's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's warm reception, says of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before the book was published.
It's funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success.
She says her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was certain his work would be rejected, adding that after his death last year the 60th anniversary of the book's publication seems "sweet-bitter".
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't brag", she adds.
But because Paddington seemed so real to him, it was almost like you had a child who had accomplished something. You feel proud of him, even though it wasn't your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he invented and created it himself, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably wouldn't make it", says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called to say Natasha was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly stopped working and were excreted from her body.
She died some time before and that was the end of it.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing that it was all coming together.
I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was surrounded by other people.
I had to really hold on.
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, already grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the agony she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I was so low, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an all-encompassing compassion for Nada.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, and he took his own life at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day", she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, of Lydney, England, says that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everybody knew his smile.
They always said he could light up any room.
But before he died, he quit his job because it was "a really black place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old, and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still worried about the domino effect".
Sharon Davis created the cards to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they're just friends.
Don't sit quietly and talk to someone.
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say anything about feeling down or sad or saying anything.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was in a complete blackout, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them.
He says his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: "It's ripping a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must live and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for, a time-limited and limited investigation, maybe we could reach some consensus", said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would fall apart into opposing camps, leading to a deadlock.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance is momentary.
The congressional elections are just a few weeks away on November 6th, and if the Republicans lose, as predicted, the chances of a particular person being elected to the nation's highest court will be significantly reduced.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is about to vote.
It's not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and get him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to a South Korean lawmaker, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has decreased.
Citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1,127 escapees last year and 2,706 in 2011.
He said key factors that have contributed to this situation are tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul authorities, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still theoretically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the previously stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, which resulted in a general agreement to pursue the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on the issue.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and under these circumstances there is no possibility that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Ri said in a speech he delivered to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and said he is not a natural fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think if a woman behaved like this, she would be considered hysterical", she told Pelosi of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times during his opening remarks, Kavanaugh displayed strong emotions - he almost screamed and lost his voice when discussing family matters and his high school years.
He also blatantly rebuked the Democrats on the committee, citing accusations of a "grotesque and coordinated reputational attack" orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it revealed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh from office if he was nominated and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi hesitated.
"I'll tell you what: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he shouldn't just sit on the Supreme Court, but he should serve on this court where he's currently serving", she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he's considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time to bring a hysterical, prejudiced person to court who expects us to say, 'This is wonderful,'" Pelosi added.
And women have to master it.
It's a proper diatribe, months and years of raging rage, and she can't shake it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
I guess that's pretty common, right?
She said, "I was helped tremendously by a woman who was a manager at a company, and she said that she cries when she's angry, but she's got a way of saying when she's upset and she starts crying, 'You must think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm furious.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was genius.
Tears are acceptable as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office is how one day I started crying with indescribable rage, and an older woman -- a cold manager who I had always been a little afraid of -- grabbed me by the neck and led me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy to see you.
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his girlfriend on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated Patricia realized she could actually consider running for president on her own.
"It was an ill-considered decision", she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates up for election and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called this situation "Snow Queen and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder was behind in fundraising and promised herself she wouldn't run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a battle that was doomed to be lost.
She discovered that some of her followers, who gave men $1,000, only had $250 for her.
"Do they think I have any discounts?" she wondered.
In her speech announcing that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion  gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism  that her voice was stuck in her throat.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown", she says of the press reaction.
You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my headstone.
Did she cry?
What benefits can be gained by an economic war between the United States and China
The outbursts of the US-China economic war have been deafening, and while the battle is still going on, in the long run, the conflict between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
The first warning this year was issued by US President Donald Trump, who imposed tariffs on China's key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week after new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, which resulted in half of all goods coming into the US from China being taxed.
Each time, Beijing has reciprocated in kind, recently raising tariffs on $60 billion worth of American goods from five to 10 percent.
China is determined to respond to any US strike and it doesn't look like the world's second largest economy is going to give up anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means accepting the demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure from the US trade war could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the economic dependence between the two.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic chaos in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have admitted", said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security think tank.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return refugees.
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our country is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
In an effort to restore normalcy, the government is continually rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have been met for refugees who have been forced to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic moves aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods to return voluntarily.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid or offer from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the captaincy of the Danish Thomas Bjorn, they scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been in a bad way for most of the tournament, hit the ball straight into the water at the 16th hole of the PAR3, giving the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 record since 1979, when the tournament was first held in its current format.
Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5-4 by the lowest ranked European player, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is the top-ranked player in the world, lost two holes to the last hole to England's Ian Poulter, for whom this may have been his last Ryder Cup.
The European with the most Ryder Cup wins is Spain's Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cups and has scored a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself tonight.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so excited to get my trophy back.
It's a success for the whole team and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, moved after the European team won.
He hands the bat to his countryman, John Rahm, who on Sunday beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game, 2-1.
"I feel incredibly proud to win with Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost every game in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
That's an unprecedented statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and was second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been having trouble finding a runner all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing at a really high level all tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American squad, their captain, Jim Furyk, said: "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we pressed some Europeans.
We're backed up.
Caps off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna change the lineup, and together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we're gonna find a way to move forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us.
In Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota, the density of plankton is decreasing.
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in plankton density in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of pstrokate bloom has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It stretches along about 120 miles [209 km] of coastline, from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The spotted spotted can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than the previous week.
The outbreak was also reported in Pasco County.
Last week, there were average plankton concentrations in coastal and inland waters in Pinellas County, low to medium in the coastal area of Hillsborough County, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high in coastal and inland waters in Sarasota County, natural to medium inland waters in Charlotte County, natural to high inland and inland waters in Lee County, and low inland waters in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, there are still reports of respiratory irritation.
But last week, no cases were reported in northwest Florida.
