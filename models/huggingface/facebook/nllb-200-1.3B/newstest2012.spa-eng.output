Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the former prime minister's release from prison, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic offences at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a disadvantageous deal with Russia on the purchase of natural gas for Ukraine.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeals court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge by the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former prime minister was convicted was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
226 votes were needed for its approval.
The victory of Libya
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already had its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war anymore.
The winner is yet to be determined
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a land without crime, because the thieves' hand will be cut off.
Women can forget about emancipation and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, the society, made up of warring tribes, will be united by the Koran.
We are going to have an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and it probably did not suit the Libyans mentioned above.
The truth is, it is not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each successful intervention.
When you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a gunfight that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals have no problem expelling the "Crusaders".
But without occupation, will oil companies be able to get their hands on the Libyan black gold with just good words?
It is quite possible that it will not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the Sharia doesn't cross us.
A new era of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe go hunting for the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has swept Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy stagnated in the quarter, while France and Germany grew.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer concentrating on Italy alone, but also on Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% and France's by 0.4%.
Both countries have published data for the second quarter, with Germany improving more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the forecast of 0.1%), while France saw a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data indicated stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year on year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquarter, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the ČSÚ the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is consistent.
The results are even worse than the analysts' predictions.
Main events:
Year-on-year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated every quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to previous data and recalculated seasonally.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared with the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year on year.
The interest on his ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has risen to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest rates on Czech 10-year bonds remain at 4%, although the situation in the area is deteriorating.
In Germany, there are voices that the ECB should ultimately lend.
The Czechs are qualifying for the Euro Cup.
They won 1-0 and celebrate the qualifying with a 200 million bonus.
The football team is on to the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was won by 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so they will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also the excellent play of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates its passage to the European Championship.
Because of the very good Czech defense, the Montenegrins didn't press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech XI will not miss the European Cup, so the national football coffers will receive a bonus of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first minutes, we had a good offensive game.
Both teams were just trying to keep the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed at noon Tuesday in front of the facility and then chanted death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center that works with uranium in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They are trying to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently reported that Iran is, by all indications, working toward nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon outside the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyse the Iranian nuclear programme, it would reach, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan power plant, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity affecting 5%.
Obese children are mostly from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated how important the environment in which one grows is for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19 percent of the obese had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not an accident".
In families with overweight children, there is no practice of playing sports, which is true of most families today, where only 15% of children said that their parents find time for physical exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children in Primary Education from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the program "Obesity Is Not an Accident", sponsored by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Proper diet and adequate family exercise are key factors in significantly reducing the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed said that they eat five meals a day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet", says one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with dinner stuffing
Specialists warn that in healthy development, details are also important, such as having a set time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren's families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households, they don't have breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that families with obese children are much more likely to eat the insane fries.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweets daily (70%).
Over 40% of children surveyed are normally involved in sport, but among their parents this figure is less than half, only 15%.
Make your own diet
The next phase of the study enabled the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all the possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal from the point of view of healthy eating".
Their favorite foods include pasta, meat, and sweets
"The popularity of soft drinks is particularly alarming", warns the final report of the study.
The main meal is the palm-tree pasta and closely followed by the poultry.
Children almost always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who completed the questionnaire after finishing the prevention programme 'Obesity is not an accident', there was in many cases an important change in favour of the principles of a healthy diet", the study results point out.
The issue of soft drinks, for example, is of interest, as many children would begin to prefer regular water.
Children would also be more likely to choose poultry and fish as the main meal on the questionnaire and would restrict the consumption of sweet foods and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals argue
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that was gonna go.
Three industry professionals' lectures, how to dress problem characters, and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it will get worse.
The closer the final exams, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, there is no more pin for it.
We've once studied with the principal, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who doesn't have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must be able to smooth wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given certain tricks on how to make the body of a woman like Jennifer Lopez stand out, with huge breasts and hips but a tight waist and at the same time not dress her in a way that is too challenging.
If, for example, the gap between your waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of fabric to your size.
You will not regret it, for clothes that fit perfectly are priceless.
A tailored skirt will feel much better than one that keeps moving, getting up, dancing around the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, embroidery, embroidery or drape.
There are certainly many different kinds of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all week to put all this information in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assignment, I've got more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two dressing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
You have to consider the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've got Miranda Kerr dressed up, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it's much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred kilos (please note the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the dresses out of magazines or search the Internet and print them out, and then graphically elaborate them.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with the product pages in magazines (of specific subjects, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is for Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three special guest lecturers animated Saturday's lecture with information on all types of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of it.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, the gabarina (or trench-coat) can be worn classically with jeans and a T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body in high heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or you just wrap it up and put it up your neck to get a totally different image.
"Play with it", he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To get started, you must first know all the rules".
"Then you can break them", Jakub said.
It's finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what goes with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the stock than he's planning to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have ready, ready to wear, at least fifteen.
And that in addition to the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of which are different from what they are actually wearing.
All of this has to be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who's not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is still no clear trend towards using the services of stylists.
Even famous people find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not that important).
And when someone asks for our services, we have to keep in mind that it is very likely that they will tell us a size very different from their actual (smaller) size.
Then you just have to google and find out if the heart magazines have already written about it, if a certain celebrity has gained weight/fat etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist does not just orient himself in fashion, but also understands outfit.
During your work, you must communicate primarily with the people you see, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to sort out her wardrobe and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can't just take everything and throw it away and say, 'Oh, what a horror.'"
"Find at least a couple of things you can think about and recommend so that someone can put them on", says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit into the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is attached around the waist and all the necessary tools are there.
There are also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special garment-hook pins in front, if this is larger (pins and other hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing kit.
To avoid sitting around and doing something, we've learned to put on the soles of our shoes.
Even during the photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more so the exterior.
And we just dressed and dressed.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very clever.
Mario has given me a joy by praising my work without reservation.
I'm not really good at those skills.
This is just a small part of what we've been hearing all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've realized that going into styling professionally is not a straightforward path, but I don't care what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you race all over America.
The review
A journey, initially carefree, is complicated by a series of improper carelessness of a routine journey during the morning shift.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused great expectations even before its premiere.
It promised to give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, in the wake of what was shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being a mere action genre again.
We were also curious to see what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count points are lost because of absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot even be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure starts off really well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You're sitting behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then over fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not have the slightest sense that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphics is equivalent to that of previous installments of the series.
So it's not like it's from another world.
But a walk in the desert, the autumn landscape, or the high snow-capped mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, the races are occasionally diversified by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you encounter a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
But in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught in an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a demanding number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (classic timed duel) and then a duel with a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The new thing is the scenery outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
It's not complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite a few scenery in the game than one might expect (there are only three in particular).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving pattern follows the trail of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is not a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with a lot of action is quite suited to this style of driving, although we may find something better among the competitive games.
So far, all in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving patterns, the same is no longer true of collisions.
Games like this can't be expected to recreate complicated warping and collisions, but in fact, before a hit on any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
Typically, when you overtake very tightly or drive in normal traffic, you will only see slight abrasions, but in other almost identical situations, your car will end up doing uncontrollable stunts.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can make you feel bad.
Rescue is programmed in such a way that when you get into an accident or you leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes, even resetting doesn't help, it just helps to learn the given stage by heart.
One big disadvantage of the game is that the same events are repeated in different places.
In some corners, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere in "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are first, fifth or arrive five minutes earlier or later.
This is especially rampant in situations, when you see two cars going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It doesn't matter when you arrive, because it's programmed so that the "surprise" will always happen right in front of your nose.
The opponents have one more advantage.
Throughout the game, you'll arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, you'll always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
And this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any cost.
When it's in front of you, it makes it hard to see the cars coming in front of you, so you can start by looking at the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so obvious that you're probably disappointed right away.
And it's a shame, because even though the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what's happening or where.
And it really doesn't matter, whether the credit goes to the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the qualifying in the race so it doesn't fit the boredom, or whatever.
An unusual idea is changing cars during races.
You have to be careful with the gas stations on the side of the road, because that's where you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you'll be satisfied with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American muscle cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example on curvy mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread, there is also a parallel challenge thread, which means there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is useful for both challenges and stories.
When reaching the top level, the driver is opened up to several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
You drive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you run in the dark along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the subway convoy comes behind you and takes you ahead without further ado.
We'll probably have a discussion in the newsroom about this for several days, about whether during the game programming no one thought even a little or whether the authors really think we're a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is not at all extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
It is a pity that in the most tense moments the quality of the image is reduced, and sometimes seriously.
This is particularly true of accidents involving many participants, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to appeal to the majority of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each one of his father and mother", but one can assume that no one would buy the game just for its music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we'd have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game in years.
It feels like the game isn't over.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eye with the force of airport headlights.
The choirs of the University of Carolina will participate in the "Students of Velvet" concert.
The joint celebration of the International Students' Day and the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution as a musical experience will take place for the third time at the Festa Academica festival.
During the event, twenty high school and university choirs will be featured.
The festival revolves around two concerts on November 17.
"Carolina University has a high turnout in the festival".
The choirs at the Faculty of Pedagogy and the Faculty of Humanities are among the current choirs, and the festival committee includes the rector Václav Hampl", said the organization's head, Jakub Čaloun.
The highlight of the festival is the free entry for all attendees to the high school choir concert, which will be held on March 17 at 2 p.m. in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program features the participation of Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička and his Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening, the concert "Students of Velvet" will be held at the Municipal House in Vynohrady, with the participation of university choirs, including the choir of the Carolina University.
The Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the International Students' Day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote collaborative creation among young people.
The main organizer is the Czech Coral Union in collaboration with the Jan Kepler Secondary School.
All the events were supported by the mayor of Prague, Bohuslav Svoboda, and the rector of the Carolina University, Václav Hampl.

The calendar offers, in addition to the celebration concerts, a whole series of musical events, improvised student shows and morning concerts.
More information can be found on the festival's website www.festaacademica.cz
The EU Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová, said:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic.
'The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions'
"I didn't expect a war to be waged without a barracks".
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles", Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with conviction.
How can we not take seriously his slogan 'clear and open about Europe', which he said at the beginning of his lecture, when he described each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity that he would be the envy of many lecturers at the U.C. Law School.
Vicenová also weighed in on the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is the criticism that if he is a gray-haired official, he can take on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he takes on his roles perfectly".
'He is a man who knows how to listen to the 27 Member States, communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the EU should go.'
The new post of Foreign and Security Policy Representative is explained by the question: 'Who is this EU? What number can I call it?' It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of the political union in the face of states like China or India.
No one wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda of the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador, "a good stir", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
The EU's seven-year budget must also be approved, because of the current economic situation, which is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive more support and which will receive less?
The Ambassador also recalled her main motto, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity".
"I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, or slang that people don't understand".
'How can a citizen understand that Brussels is not really inventing cucumbers, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban Olomouc cheese?'
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs are known for being Eurosceptic and people perceive the negative aspects more than the positive.
He also deplored the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says, 'What, you're all done, you Visegrad group?' and he's not amused at all".
In the future, according to Vicenová, the EU will face tough new rules on budgetary policy for the Member States.
The concept of the two speed limits is perceived as very real, if not more so, in Europe than the new concept of the European Federation.
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone".
'We have the Schengen area and we have the enhanced cooperation procedure.'
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, stay out".
"These procedures will be increasing and will strengthen the two-speed Europe", hopes Vicenová.
He also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be discussed between the Member States, not just the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If one were to look for a term that would very accurately define IBM's strategy, the most approximate would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has passed a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation for this long-term nature was laid by the firm's first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his trademark, around which he would build the life of the future giant (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis for a carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us, IBM means thinking long term, moving continuously towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its basic principles, but without fear of changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director, during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned with the care of his employees as Baťa's businessman in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid holidays, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated compensation system that rewarded the best inventors and salesmen.
The same sophistication is maintained by IBM in the long-term relationship with the customer.
From the outset, the company was able to identify talent (as one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all forms of discrimination, it was able to choose without any problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, which will see Palmisano replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
During the last few years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, an online rain of ideas, from which infinite future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that ideas are lacking, since the firm employs almost half a million people.
A reputable institution
The firm position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technological company", says economist Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology", points out George Colony of consultancy Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between going into business and directly creating a business.
IBM -- or the "Big Green" -- as it's known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (developing both hardware and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the most patents of any American technology company and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes, and floppy disks.
IBM will turn over $220 billion this year, and this year it has become the second-largest technology firm by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first outpaced Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the Future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is about moving forward, you cannot anchor yourself emotionally in the past", acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don't work, abandons them).
And that's the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990 equipment accounted for more than half of the share of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth a total of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern world financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 1929 increased investments.
It seems that so far IBM has managed to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM shares has risen stratospherically since the beginning of 2008 to 120%, and the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
IBM's motto is to change everything except its value.
It can be expected, then, that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will hold out.
IBM's history: from the cheese cutter to space flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 - originally it was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The basis for the birth of IBM arose from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "ticking clock", which allowed control of the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the firm.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson ran the company, sales doubled to $9 million and the company began its great expansion across continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years in the chair of the chief, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his direction, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's personnel and computers helped NASA guide the space flights (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of the time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which in turn acquired the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to offer a comprehensive range of high value-added advice and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying for the last three years is the concept of a smarter planet.
The aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or conditions improved, for example in transport and city management.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform which enables retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
As early as 1932 a branch was opened in what was then Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe to have one.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague, and there's a world-renowned research team here working on voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become Iveta Bartošová's (45) sole protector, but also her lover, Darina still had hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will not wait any longer and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore", Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová took Bartošové in her summer home, she could not imagine how their marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepting her husband's relationship and even saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář broke up with Bartošová one day, his wife wouldn't be waiting for him at home with open arms.
He's the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out".
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old ass who got it wrong, but as a man with whom I have certain ties", Rychtářová said, adding that she had already broken off her relationship with her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef still doesn't care that his wife locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision".
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible".
"My wife set this up as a marriage on paper and I respect that".
"The company is still going strong, I do the housework, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping".
"Darina and I talk normally, only we don't share a bed", Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", Josef concludes.
Women's worst vices: Do they apply to you too?
If you ask men to be able to name a few typical female vices, generally each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, which cite certain female vices that can make men's blood boil?
Going shopping
You blame your orange half for being a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one snack a week?
Do you like to shop at the sale often?
So in your case, shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to just walk around the clothing stores, look for tightly fitting garments, and then try them all on in the tester (ideally all in different colors)?
While shopping is a pastime for most women, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've told your partner to wait for you outside the door.
The Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear those phrases?
What do you mean, "yes"?
So you're one of those women obsessed with her looks.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent the complaints, the more annoying the women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinity vibe.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your mate for stepping on your clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that you had so much trouble cleaning?
If you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not occupy the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making unpleasant comments
"Worn underwear is left with dirty clothes".
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"Wet cloth is not left on the floor!"
If you make these comments to your partner several times a day, know that this will get him out of your box.
You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also like slander, gossip, but also offense and conspiracy against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us sometimes misses a small, harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of most women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women who are not in control, who love to gossip and do so often, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female workforce.
Jagr and Voráček helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr made two assists in the NHL game on Monday, bringing the win over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and putting the Czech players back in the lead.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old's play, and took it a step further and was declared the best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the match and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jagr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game that I'd do a triple".
"I was introducing him".
"Sometimes they look like ambushes", explained Jágr, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first trallado.
A little later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Voráček got the puck from behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles until Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but by the start of the second half the Flyers were dominating.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr, he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the fourth hole of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr pondered.
"I never would have thought that at the end of my career I would be playing with an athlete like him".
"I'm very pleased with it".
"I want to play for him".
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results", Jagr adds.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with the goal from Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, from penalty, until she got a goal away.
Matt Read didn't allow any more complications, though they ended up outnumbered two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field".
"He shot the disc, I took off, and Read went to the farthest part".
"I tried to hit the puck and I'm happy because I got it", Voráček described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With their win, Philadelphia has moved up to the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second-third he retired due to an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a two-goal margin, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec didn't know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the match with only five defenses.
"That is bad".
"We played the game with one veteran player, the rest were novices".
"In short, but there is nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"So rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist".
"We had to simplify the game even further, take the puck out of our field".
"And so we left gaps", explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty interceptions for Winnipeg in the 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players, ending a five-game losing streak.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in the then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time mostly sold travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, afterwards the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies in those days also offered trips to the West, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend the night like that, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still not all was won.
The so-called "promise of exchange" that was the condition for travel to the West was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs would acquire.
The way of travelling in the Czech Republic has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, that the current favourite destination, Croatia, was not free to travel to until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European countries was introduced, leading to a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not tired of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in tents in parks, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food (cans, sausages, etc.) with them to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech krone, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was rising and with it the average wage, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, from 1997 onwards, the agencies began to prepare travel regularly using charter connections, which made travel prices fall incredibly compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on the volume of passengers.
By the late 1990s, Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the United States, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened back in 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and went to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries have been taking off every year, and this winter, direct flights from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations will be made.
The exotic countries are now visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 thousand Czech crowns per capita on travel abroad, including the costs of the place of stay.
An ordinary general assembly to elect the president, which could end in a stalemate again.
For almost five months now, Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the next Extraordinary General Assembly, which will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you cannot even vote to choose between the three candidates.
The Czech football presidents are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June, not without summoning his colleagues to find a strong person who could handle football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era ended, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the full-powered delegates.
From that moment on, and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which full representation is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
The Commission has not been able to shed any more light on the situation, even the Executive Committee, which at its ordinary or extraordinary meetings has basically not resolved anything.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point is still the same.
The question is: how do we proceed in the third round to avoid a deadlock?
"The dispute is about whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model", says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, which represents professional football from the association's management.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, make no sense of the previous two rounds and would completely negate the concept of a bicameral system", Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
This is something which Tomaš Paclík surprisingly agrees with, although it is assumed that the electoral rules laid down by the statutes of all candidates are more suited to Pelta.
"I would like to see the vote as strictly as possible in accordance with the statutes".
"So that no nonsense is made about the representatives like in the last General Assembly", says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
He said that the new president would be decided in Nymburk and he believed that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the passions will be appeased by today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will be the main player again, and so cooperation will be more generous", says the representative of Jablonice, which has more experience in football management, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated".
"It's not the Bohemian-Moravian conflict, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience".
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly".
"Anyway, I hope common sense will prevail", Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts whether the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualification match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to bring the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he can't find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen football team, Tomaš Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who satisfied all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not even stand as a candidate for such a relevant post.
"If there was a right person, I would be fighting for her and not run for office".
"But to this day we have not been able to find such a person", Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the post of president only until 2013, when it would be the turn of the ordinary general assembly.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too involved in football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might consider".
"It was crazy for me to hear some people say that they don't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment".
"I'd like to change that view", he adds.
What is supposedly most upsetting Paclík at the moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Regional Football Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the status quo will remain and nothing in football will change".
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will be even less profitable", Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a telephone eavesdropping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring with Pelta's victory".
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us", said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "I would sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president".
In the event of Paclík winning the elections on Thursday, cooperation with Pelta could be considered in the future.
The other candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco, is of the same opinion.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow".
"He is very capable".
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation".
"but not as a manager of an association".
"I don't stick my nose where I don't feel capable either", added Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, who was later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He has been managing private companies since last summer, when he was also the director of Pilsen, which won the First Division in May with his support.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to its safe practice".
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it was pressuring political leaders to allocate more money to the sport from the lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues the new president should be working on".
"If they raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties are announcing, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going", he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see the point in hypocritically giving away my shares in the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the election deadlock.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to solve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral regulations.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the September election, Pelta promised to focus, should he be elected, on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could be good for him to defend and present, in a wider context, his ideas on football management.
"People of all levels have been involved in football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new President this Thursday".
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association", thinks the man who is associated mainly with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the elections are due to the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were passed which were not as perfect as everyone thought".
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September", Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am prepared to respond in case this fails".
"It's a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist", says Pelta.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
He had previously said he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his law training, and was aware that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
He hadn't attacked Thomas Paclík for a long time, who, unlike Pelta, didn't leave a puppet with his head up.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already had some success".
"But their attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign".
"That's why many of them doubt his true character", he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
This last one should be a showcase for football promotion.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year".
"Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as football president would not entail any personal modification of the squad.
"You would have to know the tasks of each employee first", he said, referring to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, a understandable nervousness reigns.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios being predicted ahead of the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working with enthusiasm.
If the fourth General Assembly elects the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people will surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, should he be elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He also pledges to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, raise more money for football and continue the work started by former president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself entirely to football".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, to professional football or the training of high-performing young footballers".
"I don't mean that I would do it all alone", Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee so that each member can focus on a specific area".
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, go forward with great momentum".
"Many people probably won't like it, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others", he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that he has considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step", he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people have told me not to give up, because then others would give up too".
"It's about having faith not to give up like that", he said.
They say it also motivates him to continue the work he's already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a large part of the work was completed that I do not want to lose now".
"There are processes that have started and will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them", he announced, worried that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the association could return to what it was before the time of Hašek.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him are mostly all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few".
"You can blame me for a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone".
"I try to be objective".
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones", Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only a bohemian president would be.
"Although some people try to say the opposite, I intend to do my best for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to think about the fact that the second division would be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would go to the first division".
"The current situation would not be the case where we have only three teams from Moravia, which is a problem for young Moravian players", Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential race, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and knows that there are clear successes behind me", said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of kroner from disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the fault in the Federation's lack of unity.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year".
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably continue what Ivan Hašek has already started and will not significantly change the staffing of the committees".
"I don't want to use that to my advantage", he says of his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
I jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Anyone visiting Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip last year and a half, there was something she couldn't miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back over the water, she looked up at the artistic dome above, swam toward the marble angles, which were waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took notes in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and one city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bath culture.
He doesn't want anything to do with sports, says Meder, only water is different.
He is only annoyed that bathers have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe the fascinating scent of fir forests or listen to the cheerful songs of birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly", says this Viennese.
"I started collecting beautiful swimming pools".
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The well-being factor in swimming pools is so great because they cater to all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries, the indoor pools can be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of floor, the bathrooms have a water surface".
"On the one hand it's transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and art history in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are the waters with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many open pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city has its eyes on the roofed pool in Zurich, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Antony, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: The Ötztal water cathedral looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Three open springs produce steam in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise in the background.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn't get the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people think they have reached a toilet.
The smell comes from medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose yeast sticks to the skin upon entering the pool, a special enjoyment of well-being.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful places to bathe, when she wanted to visit open pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow modernist building, he saw the weeds growing among the tiles.
The decline was countered by a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind each other; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its meticulous modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of pool collector Iris Meder, and not just because it's natural from the Black Forest.
"It's very rewarding to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit", says Meder.
In a palace like this, the immersion in the thermal pool apparently doesn't matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
The following is the list of the Member States:
The issue is clear to the public, according to a survey, 84% of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of those surveyed claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the world's hunger problem.
The consumer advocate campaign is specifically aimed at Josef Ackermann, the head of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was designed to protect traders from price swings.
The mainstream experts agree that the players have decoupled from supply and demand, and are profiting from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than his American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report on the consequences.
In the end, the raw materials business could be reduced or even abandoned altogether.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news but reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows in an especially drastic way how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare".
Ackermann is the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in the bonds.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio that involve food price bets", Bode said.
"I don't care if Ackermann is talking about starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before he leaves his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation, it can perfect its image.
And he needs to be as concerned as possible losses, which his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that would stake food prices.
Many of the bank's clients showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments that resulted in money from land speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from being offered to their acquaintances, 49 percent would, after reflection, request that their account be cancelled and they would switch to another institution.
House 21 in Vienna
The moved flag
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Brussels Austrian Universal Exhibition won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and fell apart.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
The passionate post-war modern architecture, the clear shapes, the glass halls, the bold curves and the new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a fitting and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight, floating steel and glass construction.
The building is considered to be a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World's Fair.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions was erected after the Universal Exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna's South Station, was renovated in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was opened, it was called the "house 20".
The building was adequate but lacked the space and technology for a museum; no walls to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is falling apart.
Currently, the pavilion has been renovated by architect Adolf Krischanitz, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was opened with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, has made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an artistic ice skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the Salzburg museum of modern art, carried out the reforms at the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation of the same name are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice for it.
Not only because he sensitively reformed Joseph Olbrichs's Vienna secession, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", where he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his move to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy devourer", Krischanitz said.
The windows of the glass facade were changed, a glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a downed light panel between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the Monuments Office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office", says Krischanitz, who warns of rough soil in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that is why I wanted to "awaken the right awareness".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has been a stroke of urban luck.
And maybe another stroke of luck: House 21 could get a boost from another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary Berlin art gallery and, as is heard, is negotiating with the city over a neighboring site in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package worth millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which is worth millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper Bild reported, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, that investments planned until 2005 totalled around EUR 300 million.
The Commission is also aware of the need to improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clear the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reserves in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for a permit from the Federal Railroad Office.
There's also a delay in the delivery of the high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a break in an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank is paying millions in fines in the US.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem arises in the US, where Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a settlement, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It's the sale of mortgage bonds.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses many large banks of inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such bonds lost value during the financial crisis and are dragging banks down.
"We are pleased to be able to clear the matter without the parties having to go to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no guilt in the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of 20.5 million dollars.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for credit unions in the United States and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
NCUA is trying to recoup the millions of dollars of losses that originated.
The agreements currently concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also called other large banks to account and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the demise of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results came a few years ago, a complicated wind is blowing for American banks today.
Investors and the inspectorate have initiated countless lawsuits to receive compensation or to sanction misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most claims.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. government mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a lawsuit from the FHFA, dealing with transactions worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to account for 'substantial losses', without giving an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The financial guru Buffett is heavily invested in the IT company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired more than $10 billion worth of stock.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer companies or Information Technologies because the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he's read the IBM business report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
So the primitive of IT should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett recently revealed on the CNBC economy station that he has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM hadn't heard anything about the compromise until now.
He praised the management for dealing with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful equipment for businesses.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
Buffett, on the other hand, took advantage of the opportunity on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer, or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960's and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, their lifestyle is humble.
That's why he's an idol to countless investors around the world.
His quick and unerring sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock market went up one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a market value of over $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is real
Following the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media question the German rule of law.
One newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is being revived.
The murders of eight small businessmen from Triumph and Greece between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, this news has been met with fear and concern.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost is returning, a ghost that was thought to be dead for a long time. Since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there have been no more incidents of violence against Turks with a right-wing background.
However, xenophobia in Germany has never been questioned.
The ultra-right-wing network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving again?" is the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk's online edition.
The newspaper "Sabah" points out that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-rightist pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, remembering the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had reflected on the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish agreement.
The coexistence was staged in cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The news reached some Turkish media as a slap in the face: "German gift for the 50th anniversary", says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain murders.
The German news outlet "Hürriyet" does not insist on drawing this mental connection either.
"It's starting to smell bad", says the headline of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the Internet forums of German-Turkish origin, the police's behavior and subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not searched for suspects in the circle of the far right much earlier.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on, it's lost here, the immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armament".
"This will be the best self-protection".
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the appropriateness of the sanction to the whole network", writes "Selen".
Which means that if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen will be cleared up in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved in German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a real threat and to the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group sentiment on the Turkish side.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was then mainly criticized for the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refusing to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It's clear how a person's value is calculated based on their tax bill.
The current information in the Turkish media shows once again how deeply distrustful many Germans of Turkish origin have been of the legality of this country since then.
In addition to the effort to explain and reassess the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly cheering, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and dropping kind remarks about his future partners.
"USB has achieved a revitalization".
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial USB operator in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, the CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the board of directors of the USB was since then considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It became known that Weber would have to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's an economics professor and a consultant, and he's had a period of adjustment that's certainly been necessary.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title of "the biggest scandal bank in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it's been sliding from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once-proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager was discreet and solid, but also handsome, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a big number in investment banks.
For one thing, at $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's big banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank in front of my students".
"From the current point of view, one asks, 'How could I be wrong?'
I was making a big mistake.
In 2007, it came to light that something had gone terribly wrong with the USB drive.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very smart banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses on high-risk bonds and had to pay off billions.
To meet this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally some of whom looked down on him until recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard of.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare a loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 in the second highest paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its misinvestments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We cannot rescue UBS again", said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax conflict with America and was willing to turn over the data of wealthy clients, who had possibly cheated on taxes with the bank's help.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with a payment indemnity.
UBS therefore more or less admitted to having assisted in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank's secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Management Board and the Chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost credibility in its two core sectors: investment banking through miscalculation and asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just when it was getting a little bit quieter, just when it was thought that UBS was going to get it again, this unfortunate operator story happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it turns out, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls".
So the idea of caution, which the Swiss bankers had long presented themselves as, being the guardians of the world's greatest assets: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of real chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are ostentatious, the rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewellery stores like Tiffany's among traditional Swiss businesses like Sprüngli confectionery.
This is where the Swiss banks have been for years: from the national bank, to the Credit Suisse palace, to the elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception room through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the bank's logo is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the client wants here: security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the chairman of a small private Swiss bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does, like all Swiss bankers, also business with both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the manners of the Anglo-Saxons".
In fact, UBS switched to Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had ever lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
What makes you think that?
The Swiss bankers are being consulted, so they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges which, because of the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and it keeps growing.
So it served to complement the two different banks that were the forerunners of UBS: a rich but dormant bank with its asset management centre in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalisation.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could spin a big financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from apprenticeship at the bank to the top".
Finally, Ospel has trusted Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality", Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, perhaps.
The mischief came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the board meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Get Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They were at the top of the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of banks at the time.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some of the steps worked out well.
In foreign exchange trading and stock trading, I was at the top.
However, the business advisers in charge pointed out a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language of "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Greedy for growth, they invested both the bank itself and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgages and then selling them, holding certain risks at its own expense.
And also, like other banks it sought the downside for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was on fire, UBS bought there", said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to clean up turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
The UBS seats became projectile seats and are unsafe to this day.
Nowadays, whoever runs a big bank has a job that's almost impossible.
He must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, the banking expert, has an idea, to end investment banking, to focus on asset management, to go back to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must be greatly reduced, it is clear at the moment.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only thought of as a temporary solution, as the bank the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has imposed himself: He must run UBS's business permanently, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its mid-1990s state.
He's cutting out 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it? - Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself right now.
So far, he's just saying he's going to look for a place with his wife in Zurich first.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared American investors earlier this week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained ineffective.
The slowdown in industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis at its source.
General relief might not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek cups were half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the spotlight, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First, the financial assets are listed in the sales list.
The Dow Jones Standard Stock Index closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
At the session, the market barometer ranges from 12,027 to 12,170 points.

The Nasdaq index of the technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and exited the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index is dismissed with a fall of 1.2 per cent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its output and is at the end of its boom.
The companies produced two per cent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistics office.
This created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot get out of recession so quickly, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
So from their point of view it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, he throws a decade of old principles aside and enters the American tech sector.
Its investment of over ten billion dollars in IBM supports the share price of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the market trend at the beginning just one percentage higher.

Smart greys are spreading in cities
In many places, greyhounds are considered "problem birds", and experts say that these highly intelligent animals are not driven out of cities for long.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the greys have belonged to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors for the filth and noise of the animals are accumulating.
Although no means has emerged against the "problem birds" so far.
The greys no longer leave the cities, say experts at the first symposium on greys in Leer, East Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Alternatives are being sought in the cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grasses from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture are visibly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, increasing construction, and the falling of trees that house them make life difficult for the birds.
The greases are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to kill the district's greys en masse jumped to the negative headlines of the press.
Critics have called the hunting of animals with bird traps and killing with sticks especially brutal.
"Pushing them out and chasing them away in the normal way is no good", said Werner Klöver, a city planner and landscape designer in Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees down is often an unintended consequence, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert in Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals drift, the large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere".
Removing them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them".
Without the surroundings, the problem in cities cannot be solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of scaring animals away from sensitive habitat and bait for resettlement elsewhere is possible.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advertises against animals being treated in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can stand a spike in the face with aplomb".
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger bird circle in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism of the birds' noise: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the greys not only harness resources to access shale bites, but they also make tools to use as resources.
Recently, ethologists at Cambridge University checked the intelligence of birds by four degrees.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to catch a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone that would fall onto the platform.
In a second trial, the shrewd greyhounds were asked to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the drawer of the tube.
Three of the four greats made it on the first try.
Portugal in the Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have all secured the final tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 first leg, made the five Eurocup appearances in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off round match with the outsider Montenegro, after in the first leg (2-0) they made things clear.
Croatia didn't let them score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a 1-1 (1-0) slump against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was given a red card (54).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
At the Stadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started off perfectly.
Ronaldo executed a direct free from over 30 yards to get to the lead in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed off his long-range scoring skills and scored 2-0 from 25 yards.
The Bosnians, who didn't play well in the first half hour, got their first clear chance thanks to goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player, leader of English side Manchester City, sent a headshot to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic
Then, fellow Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark kicked a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up cleared it all with 4 goals.
The Czechs put the final doubt to rest in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the fifth consecutive time for the Euro Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to overcome a reaction second in the opening phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal at Tomas Sivok's own goal (9).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the front lap, right in Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the long goalkeeper of world fame, the forward of FC Seoul again escaped (50.).
Finally, the penultimate goal decided the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey squandered the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks didn't go from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his seat on the bench of third place in the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-range kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Striker Kazim Kazim could not send the ball inside the goal either.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia didn't let any goals be scored.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute sidelined Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni is going to the Euro Cup
In Dublin, the Irish are playing in their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who triumphed 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a preliminary decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got his first big break.
From the first moment, the Estonian defence avoided possible advantage goals.
But in the 32nd minute, he overtook him.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, making it 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe's largest software maker, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double its workforce in the country.
About two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will circulate until 2015, dax's consortium reported on Tuesday.
"We will get more research and development facilities and we will hire workers", said Bill McDermott, co-chairman, at a conference in Beijing.
The staff must grow from 2,500 workers at present to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP's more than 176,000 international customers are based in the booming country.

"We are currently looking to expand our activities (...) ", McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to enable lasting growth in China through comprehensive instruction".
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story of World War I, "opens with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one's soul drop to one's feet.
Here are some tips for action: Gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr Englund's novelist narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of your men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What you have written here is an unusual book, which you rightly describe as "an anti-historical work".
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, fancy journalists, or discussions of tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods".
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives here flick like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" moves expertly through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are getting beehives; you spend Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a touching book, almost from the beginning.
War floods these people's lives like a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordita.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, do you stay or do you run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"Lack of facts", observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjecture, guesswork, hope, fear, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the high-sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters and other material already published previously.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are most full of life in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and dealing with what is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl, she says, "Successful, everywhere Successful".
"Coffee suit, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons. " I was like, "What are you doing?
He keeps talking about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in ram's fat (and topped with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried potato roots and hairs; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive for savagery and says of war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in couches with a cigar and a whiskey, the evening paper or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched, studded peach".
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once you resign yourself to the thought of self-sacrifice, you'd like to think it could happen in public", he writes.
Instead, it is horribly like "a condemned man being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new kinds of terror.
"Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition", writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories".
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent, ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-made clothes who carries out his butchery while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both naughty and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear on their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness".
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has "unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's Modern Memory, or novels like Un novelty sur le front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, ripped out from between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault by the minute.
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the spraying of pepper spray on the protesters, violating departmental regulations and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "occupas".
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye on Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called riot training - counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came at "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know who were called for this, they weren't told it was to get into Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile officers who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who commute to work daily, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do it when there were fewer people in the park", he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with headlights and loudspeakers were assembled at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages that were echoing from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters just packed up their things and left.
No stores were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed at the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, said it was for his own safety.
But many journalists said that they were tried to prevent them from seeing the police go into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile TV units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters' personal effects, including bags and paper and plastic trash bags crammed with clothes, teams from the Cleaning Department followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, with images appearing on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp locked themselves by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The evacuation operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disturbing public order and resisting authority", he said.
The highest ranking officer at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the department head, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "was not directing operations", Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to come in.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and Pine Street, one block south.
From those positions, the police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of officers, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the north perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air out of the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, one officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The support workers union is suing the city for the layoffs.
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, from municipal district 37, in its effort to overturn the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city's access to a health assistance fund run by task forces to close its budget gap.
The city authorities have categorically denied that accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, Education Councillor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget passed in June.
One council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Municipal District 37 officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Education Department that it would be sued.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and it has eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in poor-area schools in the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendance because they had been chronically underfunded.
It notes that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Given the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.S. District 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each poor student enrollment in the schools.
The union also claims that the high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memorandum authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a job board, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed", says the draft complaint, "and not just in surplus".
Mission accomplished, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the involvement of the United States to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (R-Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "bravery".
"This resolution is to honor the brave Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan affirmation of support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libyan debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting among themselves and with the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a large bipartisan margin, and it never got to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory -- with Congress angry enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under their feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate might be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in freeing themselves" and "commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House is set to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments which have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of subjects.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations between them.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will "control federal spending".
Some of those bills are also identical, but give their sponsors - especially rookie Republicans looking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on a budget balance amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Representative José E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as members have been about proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly introduced more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Blown but not beaten", Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the chest at a constituent assembly rally in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along to the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News' "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult journey back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House unexpectedly to cast his victorious vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how he was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied: "Rather well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special that aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special was about Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar running across her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband cheers her on.
Months later, you see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
One head move.
A frown of the lips.
And then, her first word: "What".
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted", a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12th murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard. " I was like,
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated".
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to come out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever".
The troops are more to be pitied than respected.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that moment, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines stormed into their posts around him.
The tag crowd stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were shown as a kind of orphaned child", the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know you had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
He lavishes the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, say service members.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon be heading to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls".
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops who returned in the final years of the Vietnam War faced was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are conducted in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was an "angry, violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions", recalled Cancian telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II", said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they've endured, the number of friends they've lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces mounting pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for its alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he ran into a colleague who was carrying a package of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded like an alarm", says Lyman.
However, the Texas native put her concerns aside.
I thought, no, she's 19.
"He's from Texas", he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts".
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, threw her down and raped her, he alleges.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among military personnel, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going after the army's top plank, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure", he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, she's been contacted by about 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of piling up all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he's going to file multiple cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that military personnel cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service", the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldier teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in reaching out to local women in war zones.
The result: Between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died, and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the military to modernize, too, says Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, and three other lawsuits are underway, in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Meanwhile, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from the service - a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense's Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the attacks are remarkably underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, they account for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial - half that in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case, they describe his attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, you reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape 11 different times to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted to a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about whether she had had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the living room".
"I was put in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, "That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment".
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was discharged from the service on less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on".
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same incentive and deterrence that responsibility poses.
He adds: "The odds are strongly against them - but it's important for them to try".
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go her way, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will queue up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until the reform occurs", he says.
"Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a July massacre in Norway that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found it wasn't that hard to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's personal information storage is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
By reaching out through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind a computer screen".
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in likes, wall posts and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is driving a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site's name in the title to nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't get close to with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You'd have to go through the party, and they'd never let you in", Bartlett says.
"Facebook deletes all that - you go straight to them".
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drinking feats on Facebook were at significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many status updates with his or her booze.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Institute for Child Research, the Washington Post reported.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise not be diagnosed".
Facebook is also constantly "pinning" its own population for data.
The site's Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expected voter turnout in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using information that can be accessed - longtime digital freedom advocates argue that the site should make its vast amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be looking at their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with the public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know which part of a user's profile information and wall posts are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off of Facebook are two completely different things", says Selwyn.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and a pen are still the best research tools that no one can use.
"There's no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social -- and a lot of the social still happens offline".
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway", he told a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court because it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I acknowledge the facts but plead not guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views".
For the same reason, Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, was refused permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from media access for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims' relatives attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
Everyone attended with the goal of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman", a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked the journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not mentally ill, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically alleviate the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn't", said a relative of a victim.
"It would be a lot easier if it did".
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Missed Interview, Shown at a Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were those who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the technological genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was no doubt a self-proclaimed designer, dreamer, and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flow diagram yonki - a man who believed that many executives suffered from "a disease of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there's a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for over an hour with Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
By this time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensely on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited archive footage is the basis for the 68-minute Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which arrives in Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there's great silence between the questions and the answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs's perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to move faster toward the issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there's something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, where Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after I explained everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I've always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done".
Nobody knows why they do what they do, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Disconcerted by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was made on the fly, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
About the Pope joke:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" that he built himself with Steve Wozniak -- a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free long-distance calls.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and you'd yell through the pay phone and come back a minute later to the next door pay phone", Jobs says with a laugh.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world".
The two of us, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious prank that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a little cathode-tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and I'd waste my time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Early in his career, as he was selling a handful of motherboards, a client asked him if he could assemble the whole equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
90 days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and that was totally reliable.
On the big companies losing strength:
Long before he led the Apple renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted the way many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, and what?"
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it's these kinds of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the decision-making forum.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position is rotten because of people who don't have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary craft.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There's a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows".
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make -- some things you can't make electrons do, glass does them, robots do them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
It all comes down to taste in the end - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has ever done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals as the court accepts the case.
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the politically controversial question of whether to accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to study the review petitions thoroughly.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the comprehensive health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic 5 1/2 hour plea is expected in March, and the result will likely further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be thrown out will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has long been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner?
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were not, they might be said to fall under Canon Code 4C, which says: "A judge may attend events to raise funds for law-related organizations and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honored guest, or appear on the program of such an event".
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive ethical gap and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several justices that the court abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges", said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were rewarded at a fundraiser with lawyers who have pending cases before the court".
Your appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say too easily mixes the court's activity with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it's magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as attorney general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pressed Kagan to abstain from the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to be impartial now.
Kagan has given no indication that he's going to.
Boeing receives record order for $18 billion
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, a transaction valued at more than $1 billion.
It's rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of their product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes rises to a record $18 billion.
It's as big as the place where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft by dollar value - 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel economy and spectacular passenger service.
The sale price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong".
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money from the increase in the price of oil.
That's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection", he said.
The Emirates' order solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-body market and helps to keep its competitor Airbus SAS' attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft in check.
Boeing's win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co. shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacan vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the gubernatorial race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacán during the violent state's election, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country", said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview a day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... they seized the polling stations, they set up barricades... and they ordered people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have outperformed Calderón, who had led the polls before the election, by a narrow margin.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the governorship, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied any ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It's the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against the traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoacan elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of next year".
The BASD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two fastest-growing major economies needed to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries watching Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" way and said that financial assistance from Asia along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune".
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means".
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depleting inflows of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth".
"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the 1.2 billion people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not go well", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid workers in the Greek public sector in the jobs of poorly run, loss-making companies like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened to have "important chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that the coming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping", would result in 23 percent of global reductions and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects unworkable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to unwittingly fire many of our civilian officials and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to fire civilians in order to meet the target".
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and would seriously damage goodwill".
The cuts would eventually reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the hijacking, the war effort would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in the base budgets", Panetta warned.
"Employment would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract that supports the war".
"The payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in wartime, and legal and political support would be disrupted".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a hijacking at the Department of Defense would be a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We are firmly against this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not an outcome that we can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves".
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about potential cuts, despite coming to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without bullets".
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries".
"Indeed, it invites to aggression"...
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta details how reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and engaged previously around the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new shore-based combat ship, and the new land-based combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and further testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it's the next vital step to improve and confront potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A glance at the latest headlines shows us how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone asserting to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating on school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's right, a lot of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Liar detection, or "lying localization", is an essential skill that we all need to acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim, "I've got you", cheat detection is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars do look in the eyes.
They don't always stutter, babble, blush or get restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question forming, and timing.
I spent several years probing the scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, make them feel comfortable, manage their own emotions, and intuitively feel how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-directed lies", while women tell more "other-directed lies" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they usually tell tend to be "huge".
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline".
It helps provide benchmarks for measuring changes later.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristics.
You better know if someone normally kicks their foot all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when you see their feet kicking in the middle of a meeting.
Next, look for groups of deceptive behaviors, verbal and nonverbal.
Consider these groups of behaviors as warning signs, not evidence of deception.
Cheaters may freeze their upper body trying to remember their story, they may point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit "post-interview exhaust" - that exaggerated sigh of relief and post-interview change once all the difficult questions are over.
Often the interrogators make it appear falsely that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson went all the way down and used the time spent while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat may also use language that distances them: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to my understanding".
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to detect deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan derailed after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada executive Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it will be a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
"This is a real pathway to progress", Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's election, though officials denied that politics were involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a request from the State Department, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrifying their young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's rant scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers", her family at Manhattan's Supreme Court said.
It was November 10th of last year when the tram driver Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting in the car, Roseanna Monk came down the hallway of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to pick her up", he said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think".
He got angry and started using bad words - the C word and the J word out loud...
He had a water bottle and started pouring the water from the bottle on me".
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,' said the girl's mother.
LaBelle jumped on the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled back into a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little one was crying so hard she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get a response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it gets to a charity that supports children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior", Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed at a kindergarten teacher who is holding an 18-month-old child".
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of the administration of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-named the change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead a deterioration is recorded in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the state economy's chances of growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of affected by frosts, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was caused in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number throws more than 74 thousand people without it unemployed, an increase in respect of the first semester of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth of unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in the congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illicitly it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something", he said.
Migration stopped
Lopez Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have also many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes the unemployment rises", he said.
Informal
The analysis of the Sinaloese labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor backlogs are low salaries, the entity has the lowest remunerations in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Provision.
The average monthly income of Sinalo workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the state IED amounted to 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
The State Government's Economic Development Secretariat, on the other hand, accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be destined to investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 thousand 600 million pesos, and until November have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, we have to align the effort of everyone and especially the good march of this new team of Government, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations we had", he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it is necessary to lead the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated", he said.
Work to be done
The President of the Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different matters, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think that the Government is aware that there is work to be done", he said.
They're convicting him for 8 kgs of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in jail for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office said the convicted drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of health care fraud, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in the trunk and a small backpack in the co-pilot's seat, where the military found eight kilograms (23 grams) of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues internally in the Executing Centre for the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
You must contribute to construction
The social works included in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal Social Development said that although the work programs have progressed so far, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these is in force.
"They have almost 12 million to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they should have given us a part", he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide on that occasion.
"It happened in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to move, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending", he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the management so that the percentages corresponding to them arrive as soon as possible.
"They have almost 12 million to contribute and even though the year is almost over they haven't given us a fifth".
The 2015 "analogue blackout" in Mexico is now being validated
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies brought against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue shutdown" from 2021 to 2015, when the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when issuing the decree detailing the actions to be followed to concretise the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to impugn the decree, and upon admitting the demands, minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it set for the digital transition.
The plenary resolution also rejected the demand by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister-president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not think that if I did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectorate of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He said that delaying the change would be postponing the benefits of digitalisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have a solely technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorate of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the state Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, when issuing the impugned decree, that in some way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data thrown by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts.
The possibility of "vote by vote" counting is a reality in the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not homologate its Political Constitution nor its Electoral Code of the State or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before concluding the legal term so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the timeframes provided in the Law of the Official Periodic of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state president to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes for one or more electoral parcels may take place in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; the record of the vote and counting does not exist in the file of the box or is not in the possession of the president of the box; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes cast in all the voting boxes may be counted where there is evidence that the difference between the presumed winner of the election in question and the candidate who came second in the voting is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition which nominated the second of the nominated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary counting, it is established that the difference between the candidate presumed to have won and the candidate placed second is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of partial counting shall be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during which reconnaissance and a requiem mass were held.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains.
After receiving a tribute from the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with those closest to them attending the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel of veiling located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where relatives and friends were arriving.
At 5:30 p.m. he was given a recognition at the Instituto Tecnológico de Saltillo organized by his former colleagues of the bachelor's degree in technology and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was part during his bachelor's preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always expressed it to his family and friends", Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, said.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and in charge of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him because they said that he even dizzy in the truck; yet he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "just when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his family's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
They give him a final farewell
With honors was dismissed the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in homage that led the governor Jorge Torres López, and that gave him people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of the Tecnológico de Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out both in the study and in the sport.
Bacio Cortés, died in the past few days when the helicopter he was piloting collapsed, along with the secretary of the Governorate, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of that dependency.
At 18:05 hours the remains of the Saltillense Bacio Cortés (cremated) arrived, to be delivered by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major Jaime Martinez, in the grounds of the plant, where he was already expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned in Cadereyta NL
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the shotgun, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find happened on the 1.5 kilometre stretch of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, near the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by observed that the fifth floor, which has a beige-colored bar with coffee, had its gate wide open.
Looking inward, about ten feet [3 m], they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One of the men wore a yellow t-shirt with dark jeans, no shoes; next to him was another with a white t-shirt.
Within a few feet was the body of another individual in a red T-shirt and blue pantaloon.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the data obtained at the scene, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no casings were found at the site.
In the fifth barda, legends are seen that go from one organized crime group to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
11 are captured in Cadereyta
The National Defense Secretariat made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information, in a first incident on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony eight people were arrested and one who was deprived of his freedom was rescued.
They were granted three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the town of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
When the military stopped them and inspected them, they found a long gun, a magazine, and 18 rounds of ammunition.
After these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours, one of his accomplices in the ejido La Frauda was arrested, who when he saw the military tried to flee.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the brink of economic disaster.
The Italian prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present the president with the result of his talks with the political parties in their attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well delineated", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore the shattered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to act quickly, the instability of the markets put the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7%, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' group Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result", Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could trigger a devastating new attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
He'll end his round of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Bailing out Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone's current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are called.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of his reservations about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish are better than the ticos.
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 invited came to the 50 meetings.
A stark contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a vast record of A-class inter-selection games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
That figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs in the English Premier League, maintain yearly intense activity in domestic league and cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
He has also had experience with the Spanish Furia in complicated Euro and World Cup qualifiers.
Ticos, on the other hand, have limited international exposure in an area such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernandez, the brains of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the week before by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke goalie, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the hundredth mark is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and close to Michael Umaña, are left-sided Junior Diaz, with 48 appearances and artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 performances in Spain, the following are listed: Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest don't come close to 8:00.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain's all-time leading scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the top scorer with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in their two-decade celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best gigs next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them too it will be to make the dream of playing in the country come true.
So assured bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of their two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make their only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the angeline band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is on The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are going through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there's a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do they tell their most ardent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to his concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that got us in shape for this gig in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle, and for both of those things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Watching the tour, they've been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We're going to try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we're going to try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You guys never rehearse the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to pick which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played in a while, it keeps us focused and it also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of their career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all that they've accomplished?
Yes, I would.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and we're really excited that we can keep making music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be going to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to be a key part of the rise of grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of that big band group.
We're very close friends with the people at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends and it's something unusual.
Every once in a while, a band from one city comes out, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them now and then.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them still and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a band like yourselves would stick together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is a lot longer than most bands last.
First, I think we're all lucky to be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give each one freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but thanks to its success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too much because it's easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you that you should respect music and what it brought, not get carried away by being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we're still very close friends with Bruce [Fairweather] and Greg [Gilmore], who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be the opening act for the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we're excited to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics to Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to his mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There's so many of them.
Among the first ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it's no longer a fad?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and, if there's any relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that maybe seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they may sound a little bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried when I heard them and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in his legs, his primary care physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer of the tongue for which he has undergone four operations and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated on four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which have been added other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, renal calculi, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor enumerated.
Fujimori has been in detention since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people by an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the high point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations", as published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultation of its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been presiding over the G20 since November, a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "gray list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is made up of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In the trade area, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustached plumber is going 3D with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell how the stereoscopy without glasses should work", said the head of Nintendo's specialized press in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for that support", as until now hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced players will be able to take a "second turn" at the levels of the game, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo winked at the fans of the saga and repeated the formula of the success of previous installments, consisting of the plumber of the mustache will have to travel platforms mined of dangers with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has processed the extradition of ex-governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of US$70 million.
This is the end of the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and executive, given that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his term of office he "did not get his hands" into judicial resolutions and handled all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, they will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional instances to prosecute the former president of 2000-2004 were exhausted.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has solved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the defamation of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The institution was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of untrained kids
The first 25 years of the Trinijove social support institution are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation over the course of this quarter of a century.
In addition to this, there are now over 100 jobs for this social group.
The anniversary was marked yesterday at an event held in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighbourhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, unemployment, with problems of radicalisation or in a situation of marginalization.
The celebration in Sant Andreu yesterday brought together a large number of leaders from institutions and entities that have been working with the association for 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of Trinijove's work.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former socialist Education Councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gomà.
The current councillor of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the great hall of the Fabra i Coats.
He said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does", he said.
A farmhouse where macrofiestas were held has been evacuated
The invaders had taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate yesterday at noon without offering resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived the residents of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building voluntarily yesterday at noon, where they were organizing unlawful macrofiestas that despaired the neighborhood, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be access control", the administrator said.
The occupants, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the invaders of the estate made it unfair competition, since they sold the cups at three euros, while in the disco they are 10.
The owner of the leisure venue had to respond to neighbourly complaints about noise, while, as she pointed out, the inconveniences are not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the PP municipal group in the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the building to end the problems of coexistence and civism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past months the occupiers had been entering all floors of the building and in almost all floors, and that in some even have been robberies.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivility that has been generated in the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police went to 35 rue de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the occasion of the call beyond polemics over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the height of the now-defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), the administration printed a few promotional stamps for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In fact, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York's Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again situated, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park is consistent with this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the boars in the role of Yogi Bear.
It was in these until, in September, the city council called a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door is a reference to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors on the field.
The question is, Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its merely organizational aspect and for what it implies of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to be touched when two members of this ancient caste of chosen ones recognize each other in an elevator.
This fact gives rise to one of the few coincidences between the opinions of three Barcelona architects and university professors who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front, "it becomes necessary" to debate "the mountain front", since Ildefons Cerdà's speech, the one about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is worth starting from the premise that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it is very accessible.
Collserola is more complex", says the architect for whom the title "Collserola doors" contains a "lexical trap": one must not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where one has to act".
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The dangers derived from the "uncertainty of today's public space" after the experience of the 80's in the Fòrum area "the swan's song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of boundaries on where it can be built.
"To limit something is to fix the next step", that is, to overcome it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can lead to real disasters".
More closely related to the question, Mòdol believes that, to simplify, the Vallés side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, not Barcelona", for a merely topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall into disrepair", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city council offers to its guild to intervene in this project "from the very beginning".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduit that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a hit", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes you, at least in your case, to have chosen to participate in all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his view, yes, the city should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Ronde should provide, throughout its length, for a equipment area which would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of taking root, the legal representative of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which is pursuing a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the regiomontano council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public denunciation, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal process against the brother of the Panista mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry's Agent 3 in Patrimonial Deeds, he was transferred to the Arraigo 1 House, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued after the public prosecutor's office dismissed the co-defendants and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta penitentiary for allegedly blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he only remained a few hours in the medium security prison as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was ordered to be apprehended by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of investigations had proved enough evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the mayor regio; so in the next few hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the agent of the Public Ministry assigned to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal was granted a legal pardon and no further claims can be made about the process followed; in addition, no compensation for damage or punishment will be demanded.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmaker, at about 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the jail of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
You will also notify him of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"Elements that appear to indicate the unit had multiple ground contact, the blades made contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also said the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the requirements to transport personnel.
He also said that in the investigations made in the impact area, no pieces were reported on the ground.
"In a search report no parts or components of the ship were found elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural manner.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, and had adequate requirements for transporting passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at the 30-degree incline.
At the moment, the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation may take several months, even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft upward terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact", he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM located suitable conditions at take-off, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of low-altitude cloudiness were present.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudiness conditions the crew sought a lower elevation and higher visibility area towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the aircraft's last radar record match, probably before impact there was no loss of control or alteration in flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral trajectory.
The dispersion pattern of the aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion detected:
At the scene of the accident, there is still no evidence of any explosion or fire in the wreckage.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,000 feet above mean sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably disarticulated along the route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the agreed site, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found around the crash, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Security conducts research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting a study to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center Century XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population, whether or not entitled to participate, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Mexico West State) and that since October 8, the activity is being carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Mexico East State).
Once the target of 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Diabetes Day, the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people aged between six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of disease, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He said that on Saturdays, all participants are subjected to anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic tests (seeking to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight in minors.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was a 77 percent increase in obesity among boys and 47 percent among girls; there was also a dramatic increase in overweight,' said the IMSS specialist.
He said the justification for the search for the markers was that the country's population differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows detecting if they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) on the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is kept confidential, and doctors give it in writing to parents, who are told about each measurement and lifestyle change they must make to prevent illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the television and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamas, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would prevent potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals sent by the paving were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt paving is adequate, the bumps could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the bumps, delivered in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory in charge of him develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltens, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it is almost solid, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is changing during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt layer, which is made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
By passing vehicles and generating forces, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, the chemical engineer thought, they would spread even better.
On top of the asphalt carpet, abundant, is a last layer called the rolling carpet, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt sheet and provide friction on the road.
As it is the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the stresses, the rolling stock also needs to be of the right thickness and care must be taken with the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it considerably affects the performance of the asphalt pavement.
When the soil becomes wet, water diffuses inside the carpet and is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only then is the asphalt folder affected, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, but is a process that should be attended to at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Investigators explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement should always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair the bumps with ease and without need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from the Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to reach the Miss Colombia crown.
The Valley receives her 14th princess title.
Once again the Cauca Valley is left with the will to the Miss Colombia crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was crowned with the crown and the sceptre, the department has already won 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in every presentation proved that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to appoint her First Princess lies in the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carreta Leamos.
To the questioner the Caucasian valley answered:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature a lot, I think it's a way of being cultured, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty profound book.
I am currently reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read, and today I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood".
This response was disliked, firstly because of the term "culturalisation" and secondly because it did not explain in a concrete way how each of the books she quoted had marked her.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book".
Among the hypotheses thrown out is that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on stage".
And that was evident in his first bathing suit appearance at the Hilton Beach and his two parades at the coronation evening.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticed that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico did show.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the RCN Channel's "Como en casa" program, opined that Melina's appointment as princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
Besides, Valle was at last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, which before entering the Contest are already involved in projects", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen coach Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the valley's mistake was the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
His body was never his strong suit and here he was charged".
For this award, which for the first time gives the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in a bathing suit emerged a cruel vaticinio that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give the taste of the crown.
Whether or not this is true, Melina is starting a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, eluded the crown.
That was the work of the tracer who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A California loboscopist went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th, a CTI lofoscopist from Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's top leader, "Alfonso Cano", through the collection of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the CTI section, that week it was Eliazar González's turn to be available, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the start of his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where he often had to intern for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after completing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear minimal clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactyl card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, which was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, no glasses, and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplant, and a flashlight, Elias compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top leader of the Farc.
In search of the trail
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition made by president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many criminals present false IDs or do not have papers.
We'll take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The investigator related that in one case of theft, he had to remove a piece of a house wall, for in that place the thief had leaned his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They just found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
Through investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle matched.
Although this doesn't guarantee that it was the killer, it does place him at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint technician explained that on objects "the fingerprints are removed with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a graft or tape is used to lift them.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registrar's Office.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch becomes a print.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is made.
"Indignant" people defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were crowding in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of them complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruk.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under the auspices of a court order, the Manhattan square from which they were evicted early in the morning and by trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were crowding in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order allowing the "indignados" to camp again on the spot, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", said one of the spokesmen of the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray said the "indignados"' response to the eviction of their camp dictated personally by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the Police went and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says several hundred people had settled at the point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the movement and tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to analyze the legality of the early morning evacuation.
Some of the protesters displaced there were carrying and distributing copies of that judicial order at these hours and even handing them over to the agents guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who denounced that some officers struck the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Ocupa Wall Street members or applying "laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other property they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to hurt other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and the neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that at the bottom Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers", added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression".
The "Occupy Wall Street" leaders also indicated that they plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be playing the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special.
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", lifeguard on "Baywatch", Playboy bunny, wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, bringing to life a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Revives After the Earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe the country has suffered since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of fall, the data on gross domestic product between July and September definitely turned the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% at an annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is also the fastest growth since January-March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the upturn in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, firms increased their investments by 1,1%, compared to the decrease of 0,9% in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
The real revulsion of the Japanese economy, however, is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts of the US, a privilege that weighs like a slab on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of the big tech groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen's price.
As long as the markets continue their siege of the EU's peripheral countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not let down its guard.
"We must be alert to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said Economic Policy Secretary Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The OECD said that most member countries showed more clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
It fell four tenths to 100.4 points, down from 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average of 100, falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again feeds doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives won't sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty re-established in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is being imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the date planned, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October", Papadimos said as he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear up any doubts about his stance: "We have committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else".
The Conservative leader went one step further in his push for the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday its firm demand: it will not unblock aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8.000 million, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek madea still has some thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "pre-eminent" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a preponderant place at the global level in the role of microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the plan in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she noted lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened the V World Micro-credit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a 2015 horizon, and, "most especially, in the one that has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people living with incomes below a dollar a day, with which the "poverty threshold" is set.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Cumbre, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
It is "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microfinance Summit is not only a forum for debate but also a platform from which to push forward "two basic goals".
His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015 it is hoped that 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that 100 million of those households will be able to escape the poverty line.
The impetus in the conception of micro-credits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Doña Sofía highlights as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of poverty alleviation", whose work he had known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to get a first-hand look at her lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging the audience to participate in the debate and to seek solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
'Ethical imperative'
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
He said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic bonanza, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that micro-credit is "a serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the people "excluded to whom all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendees to a city that "opens its doors contagious of the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress, held on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, was a smooth one for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who consider that the government's policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes won by the speeches of Angela Merkel and, after several hours, by Wolfgang Schäuble, the Euro-friendly Finance Minister, cleared up any doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the answer to the crisis is 'not less Europe, but more Europe'.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to make our way in Europe".
This could be reflected in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow for stronger control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to 'give Europe a face'.
That is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
It is doubtful that the 27 will quickly agree on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Central Bank should be set up in a way which would allow the Member States to take account of the situation in the Community.
The Chancellor has been increasingly referring to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also been anxious to calm the mood in her party, and has not been trying to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty who are willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the European motion has a section on the importance of 'French-German friendship', Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Save for the pass.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sickness leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government embark on an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a fund responsible for family subsidies and give a speech on the issue, which has been recurring since 2007, of fighting social fraud and aid.
Moreover, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the casualties due to illness.
Firstly, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of leave on private sector workers before they can take their leave.
In short, unless there is a specific agreement between the employer and the employee, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' pay, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly earnings.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but which would allow 280 million euros to be saved, according to Les Echos.
It would also be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on civil servants a day of absence without remuneration in the event of a work stoppage (so far, they have no absence, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority is also re-introducing the issue of fraud, this time directed towards the abuse of paychecks.
"The controls will be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, he will have to repay the amounts", Xavier Bertrand warned speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear to be slightly disproportionate to the reality of the strike fraud.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been continuously monitored and various political offensives have been launched which have usually borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than the rest of Europe.
Let us look at the national figures first.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), over 237 million euros were paid in 2006 in unemployment benefits.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, in 2008 subsidies for deaths accounted for 5% of health expenditure, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% is related to maternity and accidental leave, while 54% is related to sick leave, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
Hence, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
A mean that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management company Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off due to illness.
Another study, in this case by Assurance maladie, shows that in 2010 37% of sick leave took less than 8 days, 22% took between 8 and 14 days, 15% took between 15 days and one month, 15% took between one and three months and 11% took longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001 the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave is not particularly significant compared with undeclared work.
Fraud is quite limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term losses were 'unjustified or too long', i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of losses of more than 45 days, which were subject to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were considered to be 'properly adjusted or unjustified', a figure which, starting from a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 cases of "unjustified" sick leave are among the several million workers who took sick leave.
This is certainly insignificant compared, for example, to the black-and-white work.
According to Dominique Tian, a member of the UMP who wrote a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9 billion and EUR 15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of loss subsidies and, certainly, considerably more than fraud in this last area.
Papademos: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said to Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this objective.
"To make efforts to revive the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", said the Head of Government, who was delivering his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since the country's permanence in the euro area is "at stake", he added.
Consequently, Papademos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said during a meeting with the deputies of his party "New Democracy".
He said he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but against any policy that impedes economic recovery.
Mr Samaras, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, told Mr Olli Rehn that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the measures envisaged, but he replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, says report by the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just for cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9 percent of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a powerful report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is faced with such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death".
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians lack access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians wish to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
As regards the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions which do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already declared that it does not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
The report's co-author, Jocelyn Downie, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, in favour of euthanasia
A 2010 Angus Reid poll found that 85 percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, believing that it would allow people who are about to die to ease their suffering.
Furthermore, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
As for people who have assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that no prosecution should be initiated against them.
The situation is not so clear, the authors of the report point out, with regard to the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient.
In addition, among their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Penal Code that withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for training of health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear of being complained about.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just for cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Committee calls for it to be considered as euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures, unless it serves to reduce physical pain.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signing the report "extreme", not least because euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 can ask for help to commit suicide", says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
But he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she called a "manifesto in favor of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, also of the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.

The partisans of Bashar El Asad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bashar Assad intensified, who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, have expressed their support for President Assad's abdication.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, as well as create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the mediation efforts Turkey has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them, will leave", he declared, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the crackdown in Syria, notes Mark Toner, spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have already been killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
Two more civilians have died "during heavy machine gun shelling and shelling in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said that the country is "moving towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his view constitutes "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not falter", he added, guaranteeing that "plots against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "civilian protection mechanism" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, in his view, is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to take place tomorrow in Rabat to work out the implementation of the crisis-resolution plan adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from opposition-held cities and the release of detained protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday condemned the Arab League's decision as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the crisis-resolution plan, although it did not express support for the possible imposition of sanctions against Damascus.
The European Union
Monti asks the markets for time and sacrifices from the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner had a debate with the political parties yesterday and today he met with the trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively small cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad programme with many sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that took part in the meetings, after meeting the appointed Council President.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Mr Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a Government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that the markets will have patience and understand it".
His appointment by the President initially won the approval of the markets, but then the unrest took hold, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government must run until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has committed himself to working with a sense of urgency and with the aim of Italy 'reclaiming its leading role' in Europe when he takes up his post.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
The Italian "chief of the chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will attend the meeting, also stressed the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot respect the requirements in terms of deficit".
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editors.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put some 200,000 million euros in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the IAEA.
The IAEA expressed last week its "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades, from the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by blast.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only was well versed in the technique but also, as one member state has informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in his home country's military nuclear program".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly over the same period, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. an increase of 49%, compared to a 13% increase in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3 percent are due to racial differences and 20 percent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and offenses have increased again", Human Rights First said, adding that "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant".
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, an organization official.
"The U.S. government can and should work to end such abuses", he adds, noting that such efforts could include improving police reporting on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, color, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter modified its platform presentation on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a bit more like Facebook.
A new activity tab and a new name tab allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") you follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if you follow up on messages, subscribe to new accounts, rate a message as a favorite, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi to a public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users have been discussing the interest of this innovation in a series of tweets.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it's too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream", writes @dannykronstrom.
The European Union
Introduction of a budgetary 'golden rule' into the Constitution
The Social Democrats/Christian Democrats government in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrading of Austria's sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers meeting, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an extra €3 billion in interest each year", said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor for Foreign Affairs.
Austria is responding to a request from the Brussels Summit to the euro area Member States on 26 October, in which the Heads of State and Government called for the reduction of the public deficit and the restoration of the balance of the public accounts to be included in the Constitution or in a law of equivalent value before the end of 2012.
The Austrian Government's arrangement is close to the 'German model', since Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of 'rule'.
The Commission notes that the State aid rules are not applicable to the restructuring of the infrastructure, but to the restructuring of the infrastructure.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 to the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
One strong yen
No threat of further intervention by the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic highs that resulted from the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold heavily in yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 against the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe's debt crisis.
The dollar was trading at less than 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those triggered by the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago's exports, as it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of foreign earnings earned by Japanese companies when they convert them into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda, who fears that the appreciation of the yen will cut the weak recovery to the root.
The world's third-largest economy regained growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared with the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption by households affected by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister felt that the high level of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic foundations".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", implying that no more monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuer increased its purchases of Treasury bills by five trillion yen (€47 billion), bringing to 55 trillion yen (€519 billion) the threshold for funds it is devoting to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
The rates go up, the stock markets go down.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock markets are dipping a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3.064 points.
The Dax is losing 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions over the loan yields of the euro area countries most affected, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains".
"Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, renewing market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue to be done within a narrow margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost its value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met in parliament on Monday, adopted a motion which provides, in particular, for the option for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds was 6.85%, while Spanish bonds offered 6.2% on the same date.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interveners.
The future Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is in danger of suffocating under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has said that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Euro Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
Looking forward to euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable figure than the 0,3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Moreover, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, on the other hand, has recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m. after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with with short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of firms.
It is appropriate that an election meeting should be the time to reflect on such questions and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it looks at the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options as a whole.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are seven billion people on the planet, the demographic change will mean doubling the electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil fuels will have to be mitigated in order to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is obliged to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which is only aiming at building state-of-the-art power stations.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are going ahead with their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its fleet, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
The German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, but the reality is quite contrary to that.
The choice of Berlin will mean higher electricity prices, greater energy dependence on the increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and increased CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal power stations.
In a few months, the damaging effects will be felt.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's champion in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, it is also a major user of coal and gas due to the intermittency of wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to our consistent energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industrial utility on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would take away the realism of the wonderful statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price which the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not oppose in principle this type of energy, as polls show.
We must remember that the energy policy of our country has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Export-oriented in a broad sense, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialising in international markets and capable of creating non-locational jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of the six billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for 60 years, when the manufacturer is predicted to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity, just as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France we have a safety authority which exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, with their renowned professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for people or the environment.
The accident at Chernobyl was due to the design of the reactor and to unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the two previous ones.
Thanks to these developments and to cooperation between the safety authorities and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR is designed to withstand such phenomena.
While all the electricity players wishing to build a power station are studying it, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF's competitors, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is that there is a lot of consensus on this issue between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers", while on the left, Michel Rocard set the tone by explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of a mob of Polish plumbers invading the national territory.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable from an electoral point of view, but it's very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages, and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly work in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants means that the arrival of the latter has a positive influence on the salaries and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows would mean a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0,6% and 0,9%.
And, not to mention the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring to the table contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to the public budget on average over his lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the points of growth that he was missing "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this, because although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it has suffered throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had a double revealing effect in this respect: it showed the need for a powerful return to the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected upon in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature for the absolute European monarch or a stop to the nationalist hole: what choices for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make any blows, but a common exercise, full-fledged, quiet and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we wouldn't know where the list ends), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that is bending to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, the one that suffers from their impotence and their lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated in the international arena.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is Europe as a whole which is slowly losing sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new stalemate.
We must enter a new phase in the construction of Europe.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
The only way to achieve this is to build a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's make Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are becoming widespread
The world chip card show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of micro-processor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones, etc.), totalling 6 billion units, according to calculations by Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows for public transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and represent around 10% of the global market for chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, the start is more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
However, to get ahead, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"Two major French establishments have committed themselves to systematically introducing contactless cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, managing director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile phone payments
But it is only a first step towards the future means of payment: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is indispensable for making transactions.
"They are falling behind".
"But it should finally experience a real boom next year".
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a trial between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that will allow its customers to pay contactlessly through their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating", he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by people connected to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers have especially caught the attention of investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal proof before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys financial and intellectual support from abroad and is becoming more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "support" has become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in their operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of enlightened people uninteresting.
A quick hit
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), is pushing for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the godless central government.
The latter are aimed primarily at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Grandma's reaction was, as it often happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested for life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has become radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram attacks Abuya again, particularly the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would stretch from Mauritania to Somalia and Nigeria, is a matter of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and al-Shebab Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more resounding statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogan is spread, often without foundation, about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the top contender in the race for the Grand Old Party nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them for "manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if it means the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, is almost drowning in an attitude that "sweets" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the probes, remains unheard.
It 's Reagan style .
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I will stop Iran", he bragged.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The second-best-ranked candidate, businessman Herman Cain, shows a shameful ignorance of such matters.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "attempts to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas too and won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston when it came to fighting terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But attacks are not easy for them.
The population is more positive about Obama's national security record, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he's wary of military interventions that create a sinking.
And, by arguing that we need to economically rebuild America to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly with Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into operation.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the shores of the Baltic Sea, amidst orchestral music and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia with Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and their Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new pipeline will bring an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe each year via a 1,224 km first line linking the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomerania Land.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 and will supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third pipe along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project looks like a victory.
Poland and the Baltic States had been strongly opposed to the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the land route through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be harder for them to influence Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has succeeded in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, who are major gas consumers and have increasingly limited reserves, in just five years.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically", François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which major contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of steel coated with cement to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid World War II minefields.
"Around 100 of them had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend the protection measures for fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted throughout its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Swedish waters, but the project was abandoned when the Swedes were unwilling to allow a Russian state-owned company to establish itself permanently in the sea off their shores.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will stop the gas flow in less than a minute", explains Jens Müller.
In the event of a leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have predicted joints that, according to forecasts, will leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the status of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, towed by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is inserted into the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without the need for any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is ensured simply by the pressure.
At first it's 200 bars and, at the output of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by E.ON and BASF of Germany (15.5% each), Gasunie of the Netherlands and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transport capacity to Gazprom for a renewable period of 25 years.
"Gazprom will pay for the full capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The construction of the pipeline was financed 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach EUR 7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone bears the risk of the expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pines.
A few valves, 15 feet high, form the gas exit gate.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand name notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for writing.
It has an adventurous air, hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular pastels, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks as they look today were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the present taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
And he succeeded.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, to reach a volume of 12,7 million units sold.
Far from it is the confidential production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, since the notebook attracts businessmen, students and professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre, and has managed to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and to the need to write, despite the rise of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week for disabled people's employment starts today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is twice the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No", says Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a great deal to be done".
It should be noted that the unemployed disabled continue to face numerous obstacles to access employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed their secondary education and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, longterm unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In other words, there are a number of issues which make it particularly difficult to return to work and which "are at the heart of the problem", says Christian Grapin, managing director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
There are also those that are not mentioned; people's minds move forward, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité association pointed out that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually handicapped".
The result: private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from reaching the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date back to 2008, the ratio is 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof is that the number of establishments 'subject to this contribution', as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has put a lot of pressure on companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among the large groups".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared with 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy to see"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens are about to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45), and they don't hide the pleasure they get from this friendly match.
We dare not say that there was any collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the podium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have truly made peace.
Five months after his striker's gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for being Belgian".
"I want to go forward", the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his performances in his team and in the selection, "it's a set", he has justified himself.
"I'm in Lille all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to get myself set".
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, at last, "shine".
Not to mention the pleasure.
He has been cheering for the Blues since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This will certainly reinforce the "special" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We just faced each other a while ago.
"Playing against them is always a joy".
Leekens has made a simple reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala game".
"Proud" also to see, as "neighbor", that France "is again a very high-level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job", he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not be attending the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Blues to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing", he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You'll see him in the next games". Including the game against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal is looking forward to the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first game, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes are up, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has been leading since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to beat.
Given the first leg (0-0), on Friday at Zenica Hell, it seems clear that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for over an hour, yes, but they couldn't score the valuable goal that would have given them peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home".
But at home, in Lisbon's bright Stadium of Light, the Portuguese are convinced they will pass, in front of an audience that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it turns out that the match "is very even", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the game is very level, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead", declared the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, since we haven't scored outside the house", Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset, so as to "not leave them time to think".
A good idea, provided it's realistic this time.
