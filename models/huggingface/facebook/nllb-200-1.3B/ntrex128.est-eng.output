Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid they'll look like Muppets
Some Members of the National Assembly are appalled by the suggestion to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue has its origins in a plan to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives of all political factions in the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned because it rhymed with Twp and Pwp.
For the readers outside Wales, the Welsh word for daft is poop and pwp is poop.
A member of the plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and had offered other names.
The Welsh Conservative Party member said that his group was 'welcoming' the name change, but noted that the word 'MWP' is very similar to 'Muppet'.
Explanation: The pronunciation of the letter w in the Cambrian language is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the name change bill, said: 'Of course, the final decision on all the appointments by which the members of the National Assembly are invited is made by the members themselves.'
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the National Assembly for Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on the proposals for a name, which has generated widespread support for the idea of renaming the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of Members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the term  Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP-d, but the most favourable option was MWP in the public poll.
Members of the Assembly are likely to offer other names, but reaching an agreement could prove a challenge for the President, Elin Jones, who is expected to table amendments to the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the deprivation of rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the nomination of members of the National Assembly shall be the vote of the members themselves when the legislation is debated.
Macedonians hold referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is being held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to the territory and has repeatedly objected to its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on the name change, has said he intends to ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as Harlem's churches are in trouble.
"The oldest people I've spoken to have told me that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
There's no better than either.
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People are communicating differently now", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people spend their days".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope and that sooner or later they will be back to square one.
Adams added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who would not subsidize the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he added, "which is why they are accelerating the day when all these churches close their doors, because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of those churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which had previously worshipped nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was occupied by a congregation of African Americans led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's congregation planned to restore the building, they used a carillon, or clock.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St Martin's, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's clock".
But the expert who played the carillon in July gave it another name: "cultural value" and "invaluable historical resource".
Also noted was Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, who noted that this was the world's first carillon played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued playing a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church was not a replacement.
In recent months, St. Martin's has been plagued by architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved in church affairs, others in the bishopric.
In July, the church's leadership, or governing body, of secular leaders complained in writing to the diocese that the diocese was "trying to pass on the expenses", even though the leadership was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters.
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. in Beacon Beach, near Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's applause and then swam with the others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first she thought the boy was expressing his excitement at receiving the lobster, but then she realized that the boy was screaming that he had been bitten!
I got bit!
His entire skeleton was exposed, Hammel described the scene he saw when he reached the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego in a life-threatening condition.
The species of shark attacked is still unknown.
Rescue boatman and captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were to the upper part of the skull.
Authorities have closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas from Casablad to Swamini for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles added that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered to be endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, setting up supermarket-style beauty stores with expert advisers.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.7 billion beauty market, which is still on the rise as sales of fashion and household goods decline, wider beauty ranges are being tested in 11 stores across the country, with the next year's introduction of the range in other stores if successful.
The investment in beauty products is due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the shelf space previously allocated for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it planned to double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing product lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burtons Bees will also be given more space in the brand areas currently available at Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique line of cosmetics, with most of the products suitable for vegans, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop is testing exclusive sales licences at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open this year in Selly Oaks, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift to everyday purchases of small quantities of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that retailers are becoming more like supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight cheap chains such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and the same has been done with Habitat's stores, since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and medical departments had failed.
Sainsbury's tried to set up a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up with a disagreement over how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was formulated after Sainsbury's sold its 281-son pharmaceutical business three years ago for £125m to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds is also playing a role in the strategy, adding luxury skincare products to its four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business manager, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty interfaces to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also spent money on specially trained staff who are always willing to advise.
Our brand selection meets every need, but our attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty destination that can change the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious because Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from an £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left the green when TV presenter Holly Willoughby has abandoned an £11 million deal in her lifestyle brand business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is running out of time for Truly, a brand of home goods and clothing.
Couple of businesses have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a rage, stepping down from their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "grumpy" when the TV star admitted at a heated meeting at the headquarters of his business empire, Marlows, in Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new £1.5 million contracts meant she no longer had enough time to devote to the clothing and home-wear brand Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11m.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Trul, Jones left the UK for one of his holiday homes.
One source said "Truly was definitely Holly's main preference.
It was supposed to secure her future, so she thought she'd be doing it for the next couple of decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the case completely baffled.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the launch of the product line.
There's a warehouse at Marlow headquarters full of ready-to-sell merchandise.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of "This Morning", one of Britain's highest-paid celebrities, could cost the company millions, as a vast amount of money has been invested in products ranging from sofa beds and candles to clothes and home furnishings, and it could also result in a later market launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016. Jones, 52, joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in the Baldwin Television Company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and he will replace Ant McPartlin on the ITV series "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, "I don't want to comment on his business dealings".
♪ Hard to talk about ♪ ♪ Why we fell in love ♪
Trump joked about the criticism he received in the news for what some consider to be "undignified" comments about the "president" and for his overly positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his delightful "news anchor" voice:
I'm not giving up anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the nuclear negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding" response from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament efforts.
He noted that the United States would continue to impose restrictions on the country.
Trump's speech was much more upbeat.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
The war with North Korea was about to begin.
Millions of people would have died.
We're doing really well now.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had good results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the repatriation of the remains of American servicemen.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
"Being president is very easy, but instead of having 10,000 people waiting outside to get into this packed stadium, we'd better have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate an Indonesian island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international help, so things are a bit complicated", said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palus, it's not clear yet if foreigners will be allowed to work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation and asked to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly unprepared to deal with the force of nature.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren likely increased Palus' death toll.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is quite challenging even at peak times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stopped in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is heading to Palus, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, and he's allocated money for roads and railways.
But the budget deficit is a threat to Mr Joko's government, as new elections are due next year.
Mr. Jokot is also under pressure from the tensions among the separatists in Indonesia, where the majority of the Muslim community has turned to a more conservative form of religion.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced by street fighting between Christian and Muslim factions, using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scoring the winning goal in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal, as his team led 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it in the direction of a post further away.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the net.
It fell over with Kepa Arrizabala jumping and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get that position, get the ball and players like Shaq pass the ball as much as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming, I made one touch and I gave a long blow without thinking.
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 thanks to a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward was in the game, passing the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before turning in midfield and hitting the Liverpool side.
Kovacic was a fast feed in the middle.
Then he made a beautiful air feast, leading to Hazard's punishment.
Hazard got through the defence and hit the ball with his left foot over the post, farther away from Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3:00pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in a UEFA Euroleague game on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped under the rubble of buildings collapsed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which caused a massive 18-meter earthquake, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on murder charges after stabbing a woman to death.
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with gunshot wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on John Street in Grayson Mews.
Police are calling for anyone in the area who may have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras might have recorded anything to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of the woman arrived at the scene, asking questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police say they're notifying the woman's next of kin.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the house.
The man was upset when he heard about the incident.
Residents were told it could take hours to get back into their homes.
A police officer reportedly told one man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
One woman was at the scene, crying.
He kept saying, "This is terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police buses were still in the closed area and a third was just outside.
A group of police officers were standing in the area, watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, using the code word 247 for September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament is the last monument to the controversy over the rewrite of history
Its removal would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious objects by followers of the man's inhuman fugitives.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as foolish and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of icons, it was impossible to keep the monument to Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace intact.
Cromwell did not loot the paintings in the English Civil War, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong man was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas, the ancestor of Cromwell's men, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historical narrative of a man who many people still believe should be revered.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people in the late 19th century, more than today, considered the Cromwellian Parliament to be a defender of external pressure, and in this case, of course, of royal power.
Whether this is an accurate account is a matter of endless historical debate.
What is certain is that the quarrel of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation and Cromwell clearly represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
The killer was stabbed to death by a Chinese farmer.
Local media reports say a pig attacked a farmer at a market in southern China and killed a man.
A man identified only by the surname Yuan was found dead with a blood-stained artery near a tavern in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the southern Chinese newspaper Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs on his farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He reportedly came with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the man's cousin found him dead and discovered that the adjacent opening was open.
He said the man had a big bloody mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 249.47 kilograms of uranium had reportedly suffocated the farmer to death.
"My cousin's feet were all bloody and bruised", the newspaper "Guiyang Evening News" quoted the victim's cousin Wu as saying.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pig.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The supermarket manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, pigs have been seen to attack humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 294.83 kilograms pig in Wales nailed a farmer's tractor, while his wife scare the animal away.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer ate his own pig, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don't normally attack, but because of the taste of blood, they can get a rash.
They're just playful.
They're very curious maracrates with no intention of harming.
"They just have to be respected enough", said the man.
Aftermath of Hurricane Rosa brings widespread rainfall to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves across the northern coast of Mexico toward colder waters.
Yet, Rosa will bring down heavy rains over northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5:00 a.m. eastern time Sunday morning, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 135 miles per hour, 619 miles per hour, southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to move the deep tropical moisture toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will reach Mexico, where it will rain up to eight inches [25.4 cm].
Then, the approaching low-pressure tropical moisture will produce extensive heavy downpours in the southwest of the country over the next few days.
Occasionally, rainfall of between two and three inches [2.54 cm] and 10.16 cm [10.16 cm] causes dangerous flash floods, flash floods, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes an increase in rainfall of five to about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters is also expected in certain areas of the southern United States, especially in Arizona.
Sudden storms are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rainfall with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Certainly, you should not travel in the desert on foot if there is a threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become fast-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by gusty winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure weather is bringing occasional heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
The total rainfall is more than 1.27 centimetres, which can cause minor flooding and slippery roads.
It's the first hundred in the region during the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical storm surges will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, with heavy rainfall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will reach Four Corner on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, the United States is forecast to experience severe temperature fluctuations caused by the cooling of the Arctic, while temperatures in the tropics remain high.
Sometimes this causes large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday's weather in the central United States is a fine example of significant temperature variations.
The temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, are nearly 20 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
Over the next few days, he tries to recuperate in the long summer heat.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures extending from the southern plains to the northern hemisphere to around 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80°C].
New York City is expected to experience 26.6 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the eastern United States is likely to experience high average temperatures in the first half of October.
The Brett Kavanaugh trial was watched by over 20 million people.
Over 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television channels the heart-pounding confessions of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who allegedly accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting their regular broadcasts to reflect last-minute Friday's twists: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake contracted the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him drunk on the head and tried to rip off his wife's clothes at the high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's report, the broadcast was probably watched by over 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other channels showing this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who view transfers in the public authorities.
By comparison, this is about the size of the audience at a football final or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News' opinion leaders, who have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a daylong session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to grow after the trial.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he's voting for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man Friday morning as he was caught in the crossfire of protesters trying to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood there for several minutes with his eyes closed as he was accused and it was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power, while so many women are completely powerless".
Flake said his department issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he added that he had more to say at the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks broadcast the live broadcast several hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he's only doing so on the understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by a conversation with his Democratic friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a later discussion with Coons and the other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had some impact, because it was obvious that the Republicans couldn't get Kavanaugh's vote without the confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit critics for playing a political game
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who criticize his plans to leave the European Union of "politically playing" with Britain's future and damaging the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the paper, fronted by Theresa May and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pushed his attack on May's so-called Brexit cabal, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was "totally brain-dead".
Police have arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the murder of an LSU football player.
Police have arrested a man suspected of the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to jail on a charge of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson arguing, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The lawyer announced that the man's bail had been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and the people of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the district's law enforcement for "establishing care and justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team is "shocked and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"It's something you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano as activity re-started in the crater, which has recorded 183 gas and ash spills in 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring a series of thunder and tremors.
Images shared on social media showed thousands of car windshields in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, with thousands joining the anti-demonstration to celebrate Catalonia's opposition vote to leave.
A group of masked pro-secession fighters, held back by riot police, attacked the last of them with eggs and powdered paint, creating a thick cloud of dust on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The scars continued to appear later, when police had to use knives to control the fighting.
For hours, the pro-independence protesters chanting "No Forget, No Forgiveness" clashed with the pro-unity protesters who shouted "Long live Spain!"
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year after Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal, but it was celebrated by pro-secession Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low as those opposed to withdrawal largely ignored the vote.
Catalan authorities say that almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to obstruct voting at polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence supporters had spent the night outside polling stations on Friday night to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations did take place, but they had to go the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the pro-secession rally with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent country.
Last year was one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for the chance to vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independence parties have had difficulty maintaining their presence this year, as many of the most prominent leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and await trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a demonstration in support of the police on her cell phone, said that the riots were fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would contest the European elections next year.
'Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government,' he said.
Londonderry: man arrested for car crash into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly hit in London.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 PM UK time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gate and the building.
It is also possible that a bow was fired at some point in the direction of the car.
The hit of the ball gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston backs the win.
The promoted Livingston has stolen Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt took the level to Hibernian by a second.
Gerrard is unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Euroleague on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unbeaten offense to seven games, while head coach Holt was still feeling the taste of defeat since the firing of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses his chance against the visitors of the Nuri.
Holt's team should have been in charge long before they hit the goal, as their straightforward style of play caused Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defence, but his efforts stalled at the gate, with Alan Lithgow making an effort to catch Craig Halkett's headshot over the goal.
The hosts were calm enough to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they might cause problems for the guests in certain areas.
And that's how the deciding goal was scored.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston had an opportunity to play a scheme with Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and managed to get it out of the penalty area.
By then, the Rangers were mostly in control of the ball, but they couldn't get through the defense, so it was mostly quiet on the side of goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the goal once.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's shot and Lithgow shone brightly in another Livingston team effort.
The shots were continually sent to and from the Livingston penalty area, and two penalties were also sent, one for Halkett's attempt to replace Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
A phenomenal achievement by Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium at the BBC Scotland
A phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Every player was brilliant, moving up the ladder beyond expectations.
Their style of play and players have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but Holt deserves respect for the way he's been coaching the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, organizing a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralli on the back foot throughout the game.
The Rangers were short of encouragement.
Despite their intermediate good performance under Gerrard, this was lacking, as exemplified by the examples here.
Their final possession proved to be inadequate: the home run was a one-off, which could serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
The controversial reception of Erdogan in Cologne
In Berlin, there was both laughter and concern on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police, citing security, banned the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering outside the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host the Turkish president in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show a divided attitude toward the guest: Some Turks living in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise him as a self-controller.
Traffic accident at Deptford Road: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in London after being hit by a car.
The crash occurred on a busy road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, in the city's south end, at approximately 10:15 AM British Summer Time.
The driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision came a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision about two kilometres from the scene of the accident on Childers Street on Saturday, where the driver who hit the bike fled the scene.
The London Police said authorities were working to identify the man and notify his family.
Traffic is closed at the scene and buses have been diverted. Motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Six prison officials injured in riots at Long Lartin Prison
Prison officials say six prison officials were injured in the riots at the maximum security men's prison.
The unrest broke out at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 0930 hours British Summer Time and has not yet ended.
The rioters, who are experts in the field, are involved in the handling of the riots involving eight prisoners.
Prison officials were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Special trained prison staff have been called in to solve the ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their sentences may be extended.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
But last October riot police were called to the prison to quell a serious riot in which prison officials were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (suburban areas may benefit from hurricane)
Tropical low pressure is not a frequent occurrence in Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as the calm storm Rosa moves across the southwestern U.S. desert, bringing with it the threat of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set up flash flood watchings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The forecast is that Rosa will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area with rainfall as early as Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service warned that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones in the alates have maintained tropical storm or low-pressure levels within a radius of 200 miles [321.86 km] of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 40 miles [64 km] from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters, which could reach up to 15.24 centimeters in the confines of Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other desert areas of the southern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, rainfall is likely to be between 2.54 and 5.08 centimetres, with rainfall ranging to 10.16 centimetres in limited areas.
For areas that can withstand sudden floods, the Rosa rains can be a blessing as the region struggles with drought.
While flooding is a major concern, it is likely to be beneficial because of droughts in South America.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme, or second-grade, drought, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will cross the Baja California Peninsula into mainland Mexico.
Rosa, which was still hurricane-level on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 6.43 miles per hour, is now 619,95 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 19.31 miles per hour.
The storm is coming into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and therefore is fading a little.
Rosa is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or midnight.
Rainfall in certain areas of Mexico can be high, causing significant flooding.
 From California to northwest Sonora, rainfall is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 centimeters, sometimes as high as 25.4 centimeters, weather.com reported.
Rosa then moves northward across Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure moving over Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main threat following Rosa or its aftermath is very heavy rains in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These downpours can cause life-threatening flash floods and flash floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 0400 hours UK summer time.
The victim was taken to a stable hospital.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking anyone who may have cell phone recordings of the incident to contact them.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "under the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party".
"Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said in his eulogy in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "carried away" during his nomination process by the "anger and anger" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was assaulted by a man decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his allegations.
The president said Saturday that America saw Kavanaugh's glory, quality and courage that day.
"The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most esteemed jurists of our time, "with an impeccable record in public service", he told a crowd in support of West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination, while also talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running, he said.
That's why I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and prevent".
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor on the Kavanaugh nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, the senior aide to the Republican leadership told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill thousands, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many more were swept away as waves washed ashore after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters [6.5 feet] hit the beach during the storm, killing scores of people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach, not running away, and they were victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but took with it cars, wages and houses, wiping everything off the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 500 miles per hour before it hit the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to Palu 24.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
The aftershocks in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
The area of 2.4 million people was hit by a tremor.
The Indonesian Bureau of Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was nearly 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the tsunami's intensity, the BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater at a coastal area 300 kilometers north of Pallu called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The reports from Donggala are "completely incomplete and contain no information", said Nugroho.
"The area has a population of over 300,000", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, and it could get worse", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in the city of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the shore at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage circulating on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building warning panicked people on the street below of an impending tsunami.
Minutes later, the wall of water reaches the shore, taking houses and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the accuracy of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages, which disrupted communications in the Palu area and made it difficult for authorities to organize rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending relief transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened for rescue operations, remaining closed in other parts until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision employees from Donggala reached Palu City safely, shaded by gift baskets in the courtyard of their office, they saw devastating scenes on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
This is very bad.
Although aid forces began their disaster relief efforts vigorously, some complained that experienced staff from foreign aid organizations were prevented from travelling to Palus.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and troops can only be sent from abroad if the accident site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government says: Okay, this is a national disaster, we can start accepting international aid, but this is not yet declared.
As the second night arrived, the friends and families of the missing were still filled with hope that the miraculous events that eased the grief of natural disasters were the ones that were happening to their loved ones.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesia national figure skating team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing figure skater for the Asian Games held in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a senior paratrooper, I have a personal burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon talked about how after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the surfing community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one gray bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means the messages didn't get through", he said.
Thieves took $23,585.88 during a cash check at the Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole €23,585.88 from a Brink employee filling out a Newport on the Levees ATM, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM at the entertainment facility and prepared to bring in more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man did, another man ran behind the employee of Brink's and stole a bag of money for the delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, the press release said, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves is requested to contact Newport Police on (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper to change his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, a man tweeted about the change, writing: "The former Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and he also used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
She's replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her show during the hours, the author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious significance to him.
"I think that 'ye' is one of the most used words in the Bible, meaning 'there,'" West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, they're us.
I changed my name from Kany, which means "the one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
Kanye West is by no means the only rapper to perform under his own name.
Sean Combs is known primarily as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator JAY-Z has also used his own name with and without a hyphen, uppercase and lowercase.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to contain the Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, the military attacked a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people as leftist student organizations were consolidating throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying monthly stipends to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
"As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double its research funding", said AI financier and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made following statements made by various parts of the US government regarding AI, although the US generally lacks an official AI strategy.
At the same time, China last year announced its plan to be a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US, and we are working towards the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding would double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will be in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat America's top Othello player, and he later served on the board of Microsoft Research and as president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the next dreamers.
"US scientists have to work hard to get government funding", Lee said.
"It's not China that takes over the educators, it's the companies", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired brilliant researchers from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. support AI efforts.
"I think people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card", the man said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
"The National Science Foundation of China distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower", Lee said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from both industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an AI Select Committee.
This month, DARPA announced that it had started funding the $2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Science Foundation is currently funding over $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, there has been no change in U.S. law to create the National Intelligence Council.
Macedonians vote to change the name of the country in a referendum
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia's bid for EU and NATO membership from being approved.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to that territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement on Macedonia's new name in June, but anti-nationalists argue that the name would damage the national identity of Macedonia's Slav population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum and the campaign of disapproval has raised doubts as to whether voter turnout will reach the 50% required for the referendum to take effect.
The referendum asks: Do you support Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is the price to pay for Macedonia, one of the states created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join organizations like the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective arm of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of any irregularities as of 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in Strumica in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which would allow them to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage, putting chairs in front of the tents for those who would ignore the referendum.
"We want to be part of NATO and the EU, but we want to join head-on, not through the servants' door", Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us in Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and get Europe-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring the necessary investment to Macedonia with over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think a large majority will support the name change, as more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a "yes" would be a guarantee of our future.
The results of a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies revealed that 3043 percent of voters plan to take part in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A poll conducted by Macedonian TV's Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch Manchester City player Sergio Aguero go through the whole Brighton defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence, securing a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like his 65th-minute goal came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine striker came through midfield at the start of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton defenders before he reached the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he hit the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used the first shot to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed hit.
"Aguerol has problems with his legs", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first Premier League lead.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in that game, clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball beautifully from the air to Leroy Sanchez on the left.
San got the ball a few times before he led Sterling further.
The Sky Blues put the ball in the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the cheerleader against the Rockies.
When the Nationals were shut out of the finals, there was no reason to start over.
But the losing Scherzer hopes to knock out the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, still have a shot at the Finals.
The Rockies have secured at least a wild card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure its first-division status.
Although we're not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in this crowd and with another team in the atmosphere of Denver is probably higher than any game I might face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?
The Nationals haven't named a starter for Sunday, but they're reportedly leaning toward Scherzer's feed in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th feeding, did a warm-up on Thursday and ate his usual Sunday meal.
This Washington right-hander is leading the league with a .187 average, a 2.53 ERA, 300 strikeouts and 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is giving a keynote address in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while also speaking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
It's a big event, and I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm everywhere to fight for the great candidates", he said.
Trump continued: "You're seeing this terrible, extremely terrible extremist group of Democrats.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, and you can see their vicious and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross for power and control, all they want is power and control over everything, and we're not giving it to them.
The Democrats, he says, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil, submissive and lying".
He made a reference to the Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was shouted out loudly in the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak that document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait. That was one of the worst body language examples, actually, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a big club.
It's intolerable for those who express their opinion
When the activists of my local Momentum party voted to convict me, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of the Labour MPs on the list to be told you are not welcome, and all for expressing your opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was subjected to the same treatment because she was strongly anti-Semitic.
In my case, the judges condemned me for not rising with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are oddly similar subjects, on which Jeremy had a disagreement with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Party's statement said that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and creative.
For the most part, my eight years as a local Labour MP with Friday night general meetings have been exactly like this.
As it stands today, unfortunately, that is no longer the case at most meetings, and the promise of being 'more kind and generous' in politics has long since been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not acceptable in the Labour Party and that each opinion is evaluated to determine who is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started right after Jeremy became the boss, and a colleague with whom I had previously thought I shared similar political views was now waiting for me to change my mind and adopt positions I would never have otherwise agreed with, whether it was on national security or EU single market issues.
Every time I go out in public, no matter what I say, it's followed by condemnation on social media, encouraging my recall, ignoring party politics and saying I shouldn't be in Labour.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know I have more luck than some of my coworkers, since the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and determination of those co-workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never compromise.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy area is how abusive levels have become routine.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that big of a union and with every "unreliable" initiative or change in the electoral rules, the party gets smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not why I came to politics.
Since the moment I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which had left my large school classroom literally on the verge of collapse, I have sought to speak out for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
There is no way anyone in Nottingham East could have gotten mixed up with my political views or local leadership on non-cooperation issues.
To all those who were promoting the movement on Friday, I want to say that when the country is moving towards Brexit, which is hurting our homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend my time and energy being loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually, the only message I have is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my supporters, whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of recall or political consideration will stop me from acting on what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 3817 Melrose: undefeated Ayr moves to the top
Two late attempts may have slightly skewed the outcome, but there's no doubt Ayr deserves a win in this wonderfully entertaining first league game for Tennant.
They're now the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was the team's high level of defense and better risk-taking that led to the home team's victory and coach Peter Murchiel is fully justified in being pleased.
"We've been tested all the time during the games and we're still undefeated, so of course I'm happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The good news about Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but the yellow card given to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was waived by the Warriors, gave Melros a chance to score a try which failed Jason Baggot.
Climo increased Ayri's lead with a penalty just before the end of the half, reaching 175 in Ayri's favour at the end of the single-legged half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt to take over Baggott narrowed the gap by five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was sent off to the carrier.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was a yellow card player at the time, but again paid for the failed transfer of Melrose player Bruce Colvin after heavy pressure.
However, the home team was again gathering strength and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advancing Ayres.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe attempted a field goal by David Armstrong and sent out winger Gregor Henry on the home team's fifth try.
The star of Still Game wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that the man had been named CEO of a well-known restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC TV series, which he writes and stars in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is making a living off Craig Lang's new plans.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan is keen to enter Glasgow's "successful restaurant business".
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen their path to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters at La Paz.
Ocean-like flags fly over the buildings of the Agency.
From the shores of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases have a slogan: "The sea is our right".
It is our duty to restore it.
In Bolivia, which has no maritime borders, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of momentum, unity and calm and the country naturally expects a shared outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country are watching the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in Bolivia's favor, after decades of disruptive discussions, forcing Chile to negotiate with Bolivia to give it an independent sea route.
The charismatic Bolivian-born president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is heavily weighted by Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed in late August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favor of Bolivia, or if it did, that very little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to cede Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice will decide only six months after the final statements are heard suggests that this was not a "difficult case", said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law from Chile.
And, apart from Bolivia's additional causes, the last four years may have made things worse.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian authorities", said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose flattery has lost all remaining goodwill in Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after all this, the negotiations are extremely difficult.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily hasty.
Monday will give Bolivia a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile' and an 'opportunity to end 139 years of division with mutual benefit', he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as an expression of political resentment.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"A decision is a chance to see that we have to get over the past".
North Korea has said that it will not disarm until the country can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will never give up their nuclear weapons first unless Washington can be trusted.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to reconsider the promises made by the rival heads of state at the Singapore summit.
He's making the comments at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was air strikes, believing that continued U.S. restrictions and refusal to declare an end to the war with Korea would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is wary of such a statement unless Pyongyang takes the first major steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning what it likely sees as the only option for its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion houses are bringing a series of massive head covers to shoppers in their neighborhood's shopping streets
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look anymore.
For the 2019 summer season, designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought to the stage a series of bizarre oversized headdresses that dazzled the fashion scene in Paris.
High-heeled, unconventional hats are the fashion of the summer on Instagram, and these designers have launched their foot-breaking creations onto the fashion scene.
Valentino's masterpiece was an exuberant beige hat that covered the heads of the models and was adorned with a wide brim that resembled a closet.
Other large items of clothing included jewel-encrusted watermelons, a magic helmet, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed off his strange choice of masks, doing it just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had a curved mouth, so they were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One piece of the design resembled a diving suit with a duct and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the giant sea-breathing, you're in luck.
The experts predict that the super-large headgear could reach shopping streets near you.
The giant hats are coming soon on the La Bomba, a 60-centimeter-wide shoulder-length hat that has been seen on the heads of every celebrity from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that created the highly impractical hat spread on social media has sent fashionistas another big piece of shoulder-length beach bag that is almost as big as the bikini model wearing it.
The dark orange raffia bag, with raffia beads and a white leather sleeve, was the highlight of Jacquemuse's La Riviera 2019 summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer, and with the designer's impact it's hard to ignore the demand for ultra-large items".
John Edward: Language skills are important to global citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence charts and continued to do so in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
These schools, which represent over 30,000 pupils across Scotland and are represented by the Scottish Council for Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their pupils and their parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education capable of designing and implementing a curriculum tailored to the circumstances, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will reach his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results from this year's examinations show that the languages with the highest pass rates among private schools are at the top of the tables.
Overall, 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language scored high A's.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students achieved A grades in Mandarin, 72 percent for German, 69 percent for French, and 63 percent for Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language as a life-saving skill which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages now included in the curricula of private and non-private schools are the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17% of respondents cited a lack of language skills as one of the reasons why employers have difficulty finding staff for vacant jobs.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future jobs.
As more promising job opportunities require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of career aspirations, learning a second language gives a person a real advantage in the future, since language proficiency is life-long.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign nationals gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults found that 75 percent of respondents spoke no foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with the only language where the percentage of speakers was bilingual being French at 15 percent.
Therefore, funding for language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children a better chance of finding good jobs.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
Some schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages considered to be the most important in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interests, private schools always have a choice of several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is no longer denied that in a globalised business environment, languages are crucial to the future of a country and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as a skill for international communication.
Private schools continue to offer young Scots choice, diversity and excellence.
I'm going to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron is making his Laker debut Sunday in San Diego.
Eager fans no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his playing time is yet to be determined.
"It's over one and under 48", said the Walton Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell warned that James is likely to play for a countless number of minutes.
After last week's practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to warm up at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign series of events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump campaign events planned for next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote is suspended until Trump chooses who to appoint to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court, he is trying to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans threaten to lose control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's campaign event tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
The Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia is this Saturday night, September 29, 2018 at 7:00 PM Eastern time.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event can be streamed online via YouTube.
Trump is likely to be speaking to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh about this week's hearings, which have become heated over sexual misconduct allegations, while the Senate confirmation vote is suspended for a week pending an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of the campaign series is to help re-energize Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
So President Trump's campaign manager said the five-week event is meant to "entertain volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House".
"Controlling Congress is so important to the president's agenda that Trump is heading into the fast-paced election season, diving into as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's campaign event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday marks the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is leading the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to cheer him on", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is nervous about the competition, with high hopes ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the games on Saturday afternoons were sometimes just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pivotal pendulum is a completely fictitious concept in sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think the tipping point is right now?
"They led by six points, which is now four, so I think I can call it a minor turning point", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, that's clear, because they're leading by four points and there are 12 points left in the game.
Spieth says the Americans feel they don't have enough wind to sail, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been a good footballer with both the tight end and the green and is setting an example.
Those victory cries from the throat grew louder with each round, obscuring the decisive baton that would have led to the fourth match after he and Thomas were down by two.
His putt, which won the match in the 15th, sent a similar cry, which showed the man's faith that the Americans were not out of the race yet.
"You just have to play more focused and worry about your game", Spieth said.
That's all the players can do now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but loving couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't hit bogey on a Saturday afternoon, avoiding bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back at 9:00 on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows into and out of the noisy crowd reinforces the belief that the players they're competing against on Sunday and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there's no player more famous for securing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
But the talk of European glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were doing a quick job on Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of this morning, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two double-diggers in the top nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep they had no hope of getting themselves out.
But on Saturday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and doubles are extremely engaging to watch up close just because of the interaction between the couples, the advice given to each other, the advice missed, and the way the game can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has come out on top with a strong lead on the final day, but this four-man session showed that the US team is nervous about the fight, which has been questioned by some, especially the Americans.
Europe leads the 106 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a big lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, taking a 10-6 lead over the United States after Saturday's four-ball and doubles matches.
The great duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led by two wins to the struggling Tiger Woods to lift their record at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who had bet on the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the American side after losing the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in doubles, winning two games, but they were unable to make up the shortfall.
Jim Fury's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and along with Molinari, who will be known as Molliwood after the weekend, they are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four in their fourth opening game.
After defeating four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeauvel more firmly, 5-4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed a casual spark, but has now lost 29 of his four-ball and 19 of his doubles, taking seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for the morning's four-ball, returned to the doubles with partner Henrik Stenson, beating Dustin Johnson 2-1 and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
In Europe, it was not successful, although the race was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the Americans up for a two-point lead on Saturday.
They won the four-ball-certain 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning the pair-match between Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3, having lost two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to go to singles, even though as the owner Fury needs only a half-week to keep the trophy.
Although they are two days ahead of the rest of the field, after Sunday's counterattack, it seems they will not succeed.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm under any circumstances due to lack of trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued restrictions had deepened their distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual meeting that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the United States responding", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, our country has no security, and under such circumstances, we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's opposition to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea for taking gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to move towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea has been pushing for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the tough international restrictions on North Korea.
"The US is demanding 'the first nuclear disarmament' and is increasing the pressure on restrictions to achieve their goal by force, even against declarations of an end to the war", Ri said.
To think that limitations are putting us on our knees is a dream for people who don't know us at all.
But the problem is that continued restrictions only deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: 'If the issue of nuclear disarmament had been a South Korean issue, not a US one, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this impasse.'
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was markedly different from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile attack on the US mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil" President Trump named Kim as "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim at the UN for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but added that there was still much to do and that restrictions must remain in place until North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's restrictions must continue vigorously and without fail until we can fully and definitively affirm the renunciation of nuclear weapons".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in an effort to prevent Pyongyang from financing its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met in Riga on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip didn't go so well.
After meeting Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, after which North Korea convicted him in just a few hours for "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its missile and nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim had told him that by "such measures" he meant the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the move towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students need more sleep to combat a growing culture of aggression, where they learn through caffeine-rich, 24-hour learning marathons.
Students who love academics at the best university in the world are often helped to learn the basics of self-care.
The course's designer, Harvard Medical School sleep physician and Brigham and Women's Hospital expert Professor Charles Czeisler, believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after he gave a talk about how sleep disorders affect learning.
At the end of it, a girl came to me and asked: Why am I only being told this now, in my last year of school?
He said no one had ever told him the importance of sleep - it made me sick, he explained to the Telegraph.
The course, which is the first of its kind in the school year, will explain to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as to their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health care, said the university decided to adopt the course after it was found that students were severely sleep-deprived during the workweek.
The one-hour course covers a number of opposite tasks.
One section presents a picture of a dormitory where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books and are taught about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleeping habits.
The second part explains to participants how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university city, with its opposite symbols, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of cigarette smoking", added Professor Czeisler.
He said that there was still pride in night-time learning marathons, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was still a growing problem.
Providing adequate quality sleep should be a student's weapon to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he added. It even helps to prevent weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain on a hunger diet, leaving the person constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to create the course after attending one of his classes the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and motivated him to help create a cross-campus course.
As a next step, he wants all postgraduate students to undergo a similar programme of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set their alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" from electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt their circadian rhythms and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, the goalkeeper defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor away game as Dolly Menga's shot, sent from the sidelines by Steven Gerrard, brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were hoping to secure their first away win since February, when they defeated St Johnstone 4-1, but Gary Holt's side only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as leader, falling eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' poor form didn't help.
Rangers fall to sixth, Livingston climb to third, falling to Hibernian by just one goal.
The Rangers may not be out of trouble, as their attacker, Calum Spence, was in need of head-to-head treatment after being hit by what appears to be a projectile.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side, which led to a bye to Ayr and the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, went on to take the same Liv 11 last week, who took a point from Hearts, and he would have been happy with how his well-trained boys smothered their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have been dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the goal in the second opening minute when the first inning of the game sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder didn't take his chance.
Deep-throated Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-arrow shot to the back of the post.
The Rangers did get control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt certain he should have gotten a penalty kick when he collided with Steven Lawless in the 15th minute, referee Steven Thomson did not grant the Columbia player's appeal.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned about either Lassana Coulibaly's head-kick or Ovie Ejaria's attempt.
While Liv's 34th minute kick may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performances.
Again, the Rangers couldn't contain Jacobs' deeply heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and picked up Menga, who just carried the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted in the interim, trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, which almost paid off when the winger split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block him from his position.
But Livingston continued to lure the guests in by playing exactly the kind of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up the long ball.
Holt's side could have pushed their lead in the final, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a big curve.
Rangers' backup Glenn Middleton requested another penalty kick when he went up against Jacobs, which Thomson again did not satisfy.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and counting... the day the future German physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, the Geiger counter became a foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Coronado Clocks", starring these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that?
It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the podin of atoms released from the radioactivity of the minerals.
Don't tell me, it's going to be a mess!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" rogue cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" rogue cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the deceiver as part of the treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and transforming them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers and they are injected back into the body.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman, who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to detect rogue cells, lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, which are modified in the laboratory to produce a like protein that is common in various HER2 cancers, and then injecting them back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., explained: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 controls the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are taken from patients and trained to target cancer cells, has been used to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West started with the Trump-supporting tribe, wearing a MAGA hat on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
You can hear a scathing rebuke coming from Kanye West on Saturday Night Live after his wildly-debated speech praising President Donald Trump and announcing his candidacy for the same office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, which was called Ghost Town and in which he wore a hat that read Make America Great, he began to lash out at the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've talked to so many white people, and they've asked me, "How can you like Trump when he's a racist?"
"If I was so concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago", he said.
SNL started a set with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrities made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the alleged sexual assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the episode didn't air, West's noise footage was uploaded to Chris Rock's social media.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
West also complained to the audience that he had a pretty rough time behind the scenes with his hat.
They made fun of me backstage.
They said I shouldn't go in there with a hat on.
They've got me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the drowned place? I'm gonna put on my Superman cap because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments sparked outrage from viewers at least twice and seemed to embarrass the SNL crew, with one person reporting, according to Variety, "The whole studio was dead silent".
West was brought on to the show at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, because her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many with the song "I Love It", during which he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who shouted, "To one brave soul, THANK YOU for the courage to stand up to the money crowd".
But host Karen Hunter said that West was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing.
But I decided NOT to reward (by my music or my clothes or by supporting his art) anyone who I believe is spreading a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
"As we are", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now end Kanye West.
He is not the first singer to change his performing name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, the rapper Snoop Dogg has gone by the name Snoop Lion and of course the recently deceased music legend Prince, who has made his name a symbol.
Attempted murder charge in connection with the Belfast restaurant shooting.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast's east end on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewing the case.
The Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington is not in favor of the masculine nature of the cartoon.
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-slashing role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor dismisses the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought something had gone wrong and raised the question of how to solve the issue of the masculine in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones companion Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he felt strongly that this problem needed attention.
"I feel pretty strongly right now personally that we've gone wrong with masculinity somewhere", he said.
What have we taught men as they grow up about the problem we're seeing now?
Kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of the male-dominated genre, because it shows super-male characters.
He continued: "What is co-inheritance and what is it taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets teaches young boys that they must be exactly what they are if they are to be men.
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong for the young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would never play any Game of Thrones sequels after the series ended the following summer, saying that he was "on one side of the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit is starring in Sam Shepard's revival of True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing about Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it gave me my future family and my life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit's character Jon Snow's beloved in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases are from sex, changing the past.
HIV was mainly spread in some parts of China through infected blood transfusions .
But in this way the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly high.
Because of the state's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are transmitted through inadequate sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed universal access to HIV medicines to be used to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of the GOP employee's senator, saying it's "dangerous falsehoods" and "theories of demand".
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that her employee had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are being spread by ultra-right-wing trolls and their websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information disclosed allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and released membership information of an employee under Waters, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely and utterly false", Waters continued.
My employees whose identity, personal data and safety are threatened by their fraudulent and false claims shall not be held responsible in any way for this leak.
This unfounded claim is completely and irrevocably false.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is due to anger", wrote Fleischer.
It indicates that he has feelings that are not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They can't be defiant.
They must not question the prosecution's motives.
They need to stay calm.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for the seat of Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It matters if it's true", he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant public and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We are doing everything we can to identify the perpetrators", he continued, "and to hold them legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees".
A review of the film Johnny English Strikes Again - an underfunded spoof of Rowan Atkinson
It is now common practice to look for Brexit in all new British films, and this seems particularly appropriate in the parody series of Johnny English comedy troubles, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was followed by the 2011 revival of Johnny English Reborn.
Humorous self-deprecating jokes about how obviously stupid we are about the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the grim-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things in his own way once again - and that this broad comic creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it's a secret agent, who, despite his strange pretensions to smooth glamour, is a bit like Clouseau, a bit like Mr. Bean, and a bit like the character who set the tone for the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It's also based on the character of the traveller and international mystery Atkinson, who was once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving nothing but chaos behind.
There's only one or two good moments in this last J.E. movie.
I liked the way Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing his medieval iron suit and the wings of the helicopter were tilted against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor seems minor and strangely redundant, especially when "big" spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible also confidently offer comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's cunning adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movies Bean.
It is now a perennial assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has broken into Britain's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British secret police officers, setting the scene for a major setback for the local agent - a pitifully minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a prime minister who is a celebratory and troubled figure who suffers under the weight of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character brilliantly, but there's not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisors suggest that since all active spies are in danger, he should recall someone who's retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolteacher in a very proud institution, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers a School of Rock-style spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and is reunited with her longtime partner, Boughi, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, where the talents of actress Vicki Pepperdine have been seriously squandered.
So Batman and Robin, the embarrassment of His Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurolenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the thumb of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve all of Britain's computer problems: the hapless Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their whimsical odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by secretly delaying the Volta luxury yacht; and English triggers a real disorder when he attempts to use a virtual reality headset to explore the interior of Volta's house.
No brakes are used in this last section, but as cute and tempestuous as it is, there's a kid's TV set on the side of the whole thing.
It's a bit of a mediocre thing.
And as with all the other Johnny English films, I got to thinking: is it really not in the British film industry to give Rowan Atkins a role that's fair to her talent?
Labour has refused to draft a plan where the British work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a reversal plan that would see British workers working four days a week, but being paid for five days.
The party wants the company's bosses to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them one extra day off.
That would give the workers a three-day weekend, but they'd get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and thus the government is intended to be inclined in favour of the workers.
The Thursday working week has been approved at the Trade Union Congress to allow workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that the bill's review will be announced before the end of the year.
This is not an overnight process, but a Thursday workweek is an effort that is consistent with the Party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers and the Party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The Thursday working week is not party policy and will not be discussed".
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to clarify his vision of a socialist turn in the economy.
McDonnell said he's decided to take back power from the "invisible" CEOs and "profit-seekers".
The Vice Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their entire stake back, as the Labour Party could make 'downward calculations' in relation to the perceived wrongdoing.
It confirmed its plan to put employees on the company's boards and to create participating equity funds to give 10% of the equity of private companies to employees, instead of giving annual bonuses of up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes, whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the bureau's findings could affect the end of its support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday interview, 60 Minutes co-host Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I said I'd go to the hearing, I said I'd talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, firm and unambiguous.
Graham's voice seems rock solid.
"I'm confident in my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and that can only be changed by a bombshell", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I do know that Brett denied it vigorously", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone he's named has been unable to confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival hosts an annual music event with a huge, impressive celebrity presence and the same impressive goal: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Law area not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the event's true purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by steadily increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call, or do something else that was meaningful to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, given that it's 12 years away from their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to get them to demand action, or is it just a series of clicks where people feel like they're doing something important by signing a statement online or by flipping?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million activities by its supporters, aiming to achieve a wide range of objectives.
According to the report, these actions have helped world leaders communicate more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information from the GOC on the implementation of the measures in question.
The group estimates that some 649 million people worldwide have been directly affected by the guaranteed funds so far.
Some of the key commitments include the UK-based investor-implementer partnership The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to helping children reach their full potential by pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 signatures from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like yourself, we can make malnutrition a historic marker of social injustice", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to a KKK on their website asking, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as we face the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident of our success because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a few of the performers who will be performing at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval force to block Russian energy exports: Interior Minister
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may use its navy if necessary to prevent Russia from entering the energy market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern European belly", he allegedly said.
And the official says there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States has this opportunity with our Navy to ensure that the sea lines are open and blocked if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to participants in an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that represents the 'voice of the energy consumer' in the USA.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, reinforcement and fuel substitution", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to push back the "unthinkable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into Moscow's "prison".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce response to the project is motivated by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of choosing their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has been rebuffed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem for me when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she's seriously considering running for president in the midterm elections.
At the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the first lady", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'm seriously considering running for president.
Warren also gave a briefing at the White House on President Donald Trump's actions, saying he was "steering the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents did not think he should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" Massachusetts voters thought the senator should not run.
32% supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting the possible candidacy and 48% opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with the possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Trump at the rally Track Palin's PTSD
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq recruiting in September.
He was arrested Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
"What my son is going through, what he's going to experience when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning with", she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Okta.
Palin called his son's arrest a "living room" and said about his son and other veterans, "They're coming back a little different, they're coming back as prisoners, they're coming back wondering if there's enough respect for what soldiers and airmen and all the other military people have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was charged with domestic violence against women, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits shelter for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories made a brief, court-friendly statement in Washington on Friday in support of challenging asylum-seeker policies, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been released.
She said she was abused by her accomplice - and his violent gang members sons - but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as producing large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, with gangs and domestic violence among the major problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to file asylum claims to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "defends decades of national, EU and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such a requirement is in breach of that principle, was the brief statement of the friends of the court.
The lawyers also argued in a brief statement that banning immigrants from entering the United States would harm the U.S. economy, saying that they would likely become entrepreneurs and "shell out the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop giving shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
"A request for asylum is open to those who are leaving their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 statement.
The refuge was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day.
Rejoicing rescue operations in Palus, where the death toll has doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more threatening.
"The situation is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her fever-stricken infant son at the evacuation center in Palu.
Every minute, new people arrive in the ambulance.
Clean water is not enough.
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through the debris and trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Hari, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in the field due to the ongoing severe aftermath.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a powerful earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
There was no time to save myself.
"I think I was pushed against the rubble", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger.
The US ambassador accuses China of harassment with "exhibitionist" ads
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page advertisement under the US daily news about the mutual daily benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to a submission paid for by China Daily last Wednesday to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest-circulation newspaper - after China was accused of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election marked what US officials described to Reuters as a new phase in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, adjusting each other's import tariffs.
China's countermeasures at the start of the tariff war were designed to catch exporters from states like Iowa because they supported Trump's Republican parties, Chinese and US experts have explained.
The US ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in Sunday's Des Moines Register op-ed: "China has now doubled down on its provocation by publishing a push-push ad in our free press".
"In spreading its own propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's precious freedom of speech and free press practice by putting its own paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, there is a limited voice in the Beijing street community and no real difference of opinion among the Chinese people on China's worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party", he added.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say which one.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh fiasco.
As many Republicans await and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment surrounding the situation has been high, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be taken back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher expressed suspicion that Senator Jeff Flake, R-Arizona's last-minute effort to intervene in the FBI investigation was enough to calm angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the phrase "November is coming!" at a rally in their Senate corridor, as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic sentiment and internal conviction are starting to fall off the chart", Stu Rothenberg, an unofficial political analyst, told the news site.
People say it's high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters aged 1829 who do not like the president and often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Republican nominee, analysts predicted a setback if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
"It's become very confusing for the GOP", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's about how the Republicans have treated him and how they've treated him", Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats elect, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided, who believes the evidence for Ford and who believes Kavanaugh, but a little more in favor of the former.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee for the Supreme Court showed her her genitals when they attended a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that will rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology agency Inrupt is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and to whom access is granted.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online database', or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and competent tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all of which are available in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online database is that the user can choose who has access to that information.
The company refers to this as providing personal authorisation through data.
According to company president John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide resources, process and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who are contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change once all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web based on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: opening of a World War I Victoria Cross winner's memorial
The Church of England, the only church in Victoria to be baptized during World War I, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought his way out of the trenches on September 29th, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later, unaware that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at Rushden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "geniusly symbolic" to open the stone exactly 100 years after Grandfather's award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin, "through a very thick fog of Japanese guns and bullet holes".
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it on with "the utmost gallantry" before he single-handedly rushed to one of the gunners, knocking out three of his opponents.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918 - with just over a month left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I know I will never be able to repeat, but for which I will always be grateful
He and his brother Dr James Vann set the stage for a parade led by a young gang from Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured" to participate in the parade, adding that "the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero is appreciated".
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206 but they only saw Piggybapp.
Imagine you've been up all night watching Bellator 206, but you're not shown the main event.
The San Jose match featured 13 fights, including six from the main card, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom throughout the night.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to kiss each other's breasts, the British audience was left speechless by the appearance of Piggy Peppa.
Many were not thrilled, especially those who stayed up until the early hours of the morning to see the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the move to children's comics as a "painful joke".
"It's government regulation that at 6am the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to a children's program", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, explained when asked about the transfer.
"Mr. Peppa", is what I'm saying.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they plan to work on their schedule to take more into account UK viewers in the future.
"If I think about reintroduction now, I think we can solve this problem in the future", Coker said.
But if it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, we can't do it until our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text, and not all of it was friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't. It was a government policy.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're going to show five fights instead of six fights, as we usually do, we're going to try to give the fans more, and we're just going to go with the times.
This is a precise situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he did not realize until he was in high school that "everyone is not like him".
Speaking on Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, she said she's speaking out for gay rights to give others hope.
Parenting also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympics, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You know, your usual long-time host, Kirsty Young, had to take a few months off due to her illness.
On the first episode of Laverne, Daley said that growing up, he felt inferior to others because it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, these feelings of worthlessness and of being different have given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was worth something, not let others down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic champion has become a highly regarded LGBT campaign leader, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he's lucky enough to be able to live openly without consequences and he wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "had caught her by surprise".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he said the age gap has never been a problem.
When you've been through so much as a youngster - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all outlook" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal", he said.
But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father wouldn't die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you can't sit in the front seat, 'cause by then you're gone", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he had actually stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I'd been dreaming of all my life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired her first song selection, Heather Small's Proud, which helped her prepare for the Olympics and still gives her a kick.

Out of form, Mickelson was eliminated from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was removed from the game by captain Jim Furyk for a double and four-ball Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he's often been for the U.S., the five-time winner split his days into two, being a motivator and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not particularly suited to playing on the narrow Le Golf National course, where the long, hard course punishes missed shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face out on Sunday, in his ninth race, the reigning British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
With the Americans, who are four points behind the top 12 singles, starting on a high note, Mickelson's race could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but she had little else to add.
"He fully understood his part of today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk added.
He's very confident.
He's a celebrity and he's given so much to our teams both last week and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more ahead, but it turned out that way and we had to take this path.
He wants to be outside like everyone else.
Mickelson surpasses Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence has given the team an additional spiritual contribution.
"He's funny, funny, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he's just great in the team room", she explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun going up against him this week, and it was great to see.
He offers much more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great advances may soon be lost
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a high lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup at the start of singles matches can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane came to public attention at the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where he and captain Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but by the time he reached the finish line, it had drastically diminished, with the victory coming only by 141⁄2: 131⁄2.
"You remember we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had great success in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, it came very close", said Bjorn, pictured, after a Class of 2018 5-3 win on Friday and a 10-6 win yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you've got the points.
We have a goal, which is to win the trophy, and so we're focused on that.
I've always said I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world.
Pleased with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow, we're going to be dealing with a whole new set of obstacles.
Tomorrow is personal achievement, so it's not about that.
It's nice to be with the other player when things are going well, but when you're there in person, you're being tested to the fullest extent as a golfer.
That's the message you have to send to the players - do your best tomorrow.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's gonna have to go and do it himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury expects his players to perform better individually than with opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last few days, being part of the Brooklyn winning team before being part of the losing team when Europe defeated the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said in response to a question about how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put their best foot forward on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you need to start off with a fire like in Brooklyn and like in Medina.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average race.
We're gonna set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel like tomorrow is the day of the miracle.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the competition and is one of the best contenders with Rory McIlroy, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the competition.
"I'm putting my boys in this order because I think we're properly covered", Bjorn said of his choice of solo games.
The new German warship pushed forward again
The German Navy's newest high-speed sail should have been commissioned in 2014, replacing the aging Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast cruiser Rheinland-Pfalz has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was due to join the Navy as early as 2014, but the troubling post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class fast boats.
Understandably, they have powerful cannons, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic attenuation.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest speedboats should be able to be sent out of their home port for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships that allow Germany to strengthen its power abroad will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The failed F125 speedboat made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder since it was taken over.
The reasons for the return were little known, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware deficiencies" that rendered the warship unfit for use if used in a combat mission.
The software gaps were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half the workforce of the older Bremen class fast boats.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future innovations.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is probably twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It is said to be in the range of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new speedboats are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy is in decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy had actually run out of "field-ready ships".
The official said that the issue has grown over time as a snowball, because the old ships were scrapped, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fast boats could join the navy.
The National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
A study by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland is monitoring the common and soprano pipes in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the brown long-eared bat and the Daubenton leather bat.
Special recorders are placed at key locations in the area to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out field investigations using handheld sensors.
A competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency of calls and the activity of the species.
A map and report of the habitats is then created to provide a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how different species use them.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures, and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the bat population has declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and its loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying paper and the chemical processing of some building materials, as well as attacks by cats with pets.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch prey.
They use sophisticated bait-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land nationwide, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only special leatherback reserve in the Threave area of Dumfries and Galloways, home to eight of Scotland's ten leatherback breeds.
Real estate agent David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
"We have a big area for bats in Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and a great place to live.
But there's still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we're doing here and elsewhere is helping us better understand what they need.
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before starting on-site care activities, as the unwanted destruction of one nesting and birthing site can kill up to 400 mothers and young, and even wipe out the entire local population.
Leatherbacks are protected, and killing, harassing or destroying them is illegal.
Scottish Bat Protection Union officer Elisabeth Ferrell has urged the public to help.
He said, "We have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don't know many of our species and how their habitats feed".
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "like to advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayor in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman 330,643.10 euros to keep her from talking about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When Ronaldo, 33, broke his 142 million Instagram followers in a live video half an hour after the allegations, he was told it was "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
"Today's news is false", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's the norm.
They want to make a name for themselves with my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine", the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the "publication of an unacceptable suspicion of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation for causing "moral damage" commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayor allegedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was allegedly raped, according to documents filed in Nevada, according to the Clark County Circuit Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was 99% a good man, of which 1% is a bad luck.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed the couple's sexual relationship, but it was not unanimous.
He also alleges to Mayor that he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he feared "a ransom" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Now, the 34-year-old woman says she's now trying to reverse the settlement because the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and that summer he moved to Italy in a €100 million deal with the giant Juve.
Brexit: UK may regret leaving carmakers for good
The UK would 'regret it forever' if it lost its position as the world's car industry leader after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop producing them at its plant in Burnston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border-crossing stoppages without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that when the UK starts to leave the EU at the end of March, we will see a shutdown of production at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive of Burnston.
Other UK carmakers have also feared leaving the EU without a deal, worried about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is saying that it's closing the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit deal.
The Toyota production line is running on demand, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota would not be able to hold more than one day's stock at its Derbyshire plant and therefore production must be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May Chequers's plan for future EU relations is 'precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at the border'.
"We want the best solution that will enable us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success, but take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not only for Toyota but also for other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain package.
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a representative of Unite, a trade union that has been active in Burnston for 24 years, said that its members are increasingly concerned: We know from experience that if jobs are lost, they will not come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week as the fight against top candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein never confirmed that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House to announce his intention to resign.
Instead, it was announced that he would meet with Trump on Thursday, who was then in New York at the United Nations.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "The date is not set yet, it could be this week, but it could be pushed back another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court".
But let's watch it and keep the press informed, as always.
Some journalists would dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of news hours was not due to the intention of disappointing TV journalists, although he added: 'I do not dispute the fact that they have been disappointed.'
Then he suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president is doing more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said, without adding evidence: "We've looked at those numbers".
The briefings will continue, Sanders confirmed, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot, and you've seen us do that over the last couple of weeks, so it's during the press conference, when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, by standing before a gathering of reporters in a free-standing, sometimes bizarre, walk.
Health Minister writes to EU NHS staff in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them well to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent her letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations have continued over the summer, leading to the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury and a concussion Saturday at 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee Mike Organ reports.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He fell into a tree and just collapsed", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the village before he was placed on the canopy and taken off the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that details about the type/size of the injury are not yet available and Tennessee State is working to determine when the injury occurred.
Redshirt sophomore Abercrombie was in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five fights on Saturday before leaving the game, which made 18 total fights that season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This move will undermine Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
Template fee is charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury hopes this will generate up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK, using the extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The movement is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to lure young voters with promises of affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty is a tax on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, providing additional money to the government's desire to fight homesteading.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second home and forward rental purchases, may be up to 3%.
The Treasury hopes this move will generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of London properties purchased are owned by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become 'ghost towns' thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the church tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when they buy land but do not use it, and called on May to give up quotas for affordable homes to remedy Britain's "living shame".
Corbyn has announced a daunting housing reform, including rent controls and an end to the smuggling of innocent people.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year, I pledged myself as Prime Minister to restore the British dream - to make life better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
It is true, however, that it is as easy for non-UK individuals as it is for companies based abroad to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant and harsh sleeping conditions are the usual reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland".
Sunderland's leader Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become leader of Scotland at some point.
The Scotsman, 42, is delighted with the challenge of reviving the North East club, who are currently third in League One, just three points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got a B class and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up with my dad watching Scotland in the Hampden and it's always something that's drawn me back.
But that opportunity will only come if I am successful in running the club.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not afraid of such big names, having previously stood at both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success is if I can get this club to the Champions League".
"The club is definitely in the Champions League because of its structure and facilities", he said.
"Getting there is no easy task, but I only see myself as successful if I can get the club back there".
Ross has been a director for only three years, having previously been deputy director at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts management staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, turning St Mirren's lowest position into the next championship winner.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads", he recalled, "the takeover of Alloa.
I really believed that driving was more appropriate for me than acting.
It seems strange, because I made it, I made a decent living, and I enjoyed some prime time.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of stuff to do every week.
Still experiencing it given the stress and pressure of my job, but management just seems more appropriate.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable than I ever have in adulthood.
You can hear the full interview on Sunday 30th September on Sportsound, Radio Scotland at 12pm to 1pm BST.
According to the study, the best time to get a pint is Saturday at 5:30.
The summer heat has helped the pubs in distress in Britain, but the pressure has been on the restaurant chains.
Figures showed that pubs and bars increased their turnover by 2.7% in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, representative of the business consultancy CGA, who compiled these figures: The continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June, with pub turnover increasing by 2.8%, except that restaurants were even more struggling.
Retail sales of restaurants, down 1.8% in June, deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars were the most successful, and the most disliked restaurants.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between pubs and bars, drinks sales rose by 6.6% during the month, while food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the home market.
Not surprisingly, the continuing struggle of the restaurant chains, although sales are down 4.8 percent year-on-year, is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide some much-needed relief.
The overall growth of pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand-related establishments.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor in the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyses performance data for 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they keep from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a false increase in Instagram pages
The news raised fears of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "basic account" to show their parents
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, secretly set up social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a marked increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news raised fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had both a "basic account" to show their parents and one that they made acceptable to themselves.
One person who discovered the secret page of his 13-year-old daughter saw that the teenager was encouraging others to rape her.
Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), an organisation that links private schools, found that 40 per cent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them acknowledged the existence of personal accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers being tempted to create online accounts where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will become the sports spokesperson for Scottish Athletics.
Yesterday, Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the board at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most acclaimed athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described it as a good opportunity for sporting leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the last decade.
'Eilish is respected throughout the sporting community in Scotland, the UK and elsewhere and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit from being invited to join his leadership,' said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I want to be a spokesman for the sport and I hope to make a real contribution to Scottish sport and help it develop.'
An American who won four Olympic medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now frequently shares his opinion on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I got a rash a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I recover and if, to what extent.
I've been working hard, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A breast pump commercial comparing women to cows splits the Internet in two
The breast pump company has shared two camp ads on the Internet comparing a breast-feeding mother to a leaping cow.
Reportedly, to celebrate the launch of the world's first silent portable breast pump, consumer-focused technology company Elvie released a commercial similar to an ironic music video to showcase the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who want to live out their dreams.
Four real moms dancing on a grass table with cows and singing, "Yeah, I'm skimping, but you can't see my tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't my eyebrows, these are my breasts".
The line repeats: "Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk".
However, the ad on the company's Facebook page has generated mixed reactions on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video has been viewed by a dissent, many of whom say it sheds light on the dairy industry.
 Using the meat to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth to produce milk, but the difference is that their babies are stolen within days of birth, wrote one.
Elvie breast pump does not puncture the eye of the lactating breast- carrier (Elvie/Mother)
Another commenter said: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these babies to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are going to keep them?"
Someone added: "A totally unproductive commercial".
Part of it's advertising, and one woman thought it was hilarious.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a complete cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but let's just take it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product, written by one.
Another commented: It's a fun ad for moms who pump (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like cows.
This advertisement neither praises nor condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all been dancing with unobtrusive pumps inserted into their bras.
The idea of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who breast-milk feel like cows.
But Elvie Pump is completely quiet, without wires or pipes and without the appearance of a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold the children and even go outside during pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: The Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and provocative introduction.
By comparing women's expression to dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast-pumping and all the challenges it brings, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared wearing a design by Marta Jakubowski.
Thousands of migrant children quietly camped at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the monthly border crossings have remained fairly stable, in part because the Trump administration's enforced harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to have children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are documented immigrants and they are afraid of compromising their ability to stay in their country, so they demand custody of the child.
The threat increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who sought financial assistance for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
About 80 per cent of sponsors or sponsored households are in the country illegally and many of them have criminal backgrounds.
So we're going to continue to track them, Mr. Albence said.
To speed up the process, officials introduced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of their arrest, which was previously 60 days, according to the shelter's staff.
Many defend their legal content to an immigration judge by videoconference, showing up immediately.
Those unfit for release will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter's staff and system reports published in recent months, the longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent protests or escape attempts.
Lawyers say these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities like Tornillo, where a child's difficulty may be overlooked because of size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to adjust to the feeling or to say goodbye to friends can cause the trauma that many are already suffering from.
Syria demands the immediate withdrawal of the US, French and Turkish occupation forces.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on the UN General Assembly to welcome Syrian refugees home, despite the country's eight-year war.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism and are being dealt with accordingly.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem claimed that Syria's war on terror is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue its "fight in this holy war" until we have cleared the entire Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any foreign forces illegally present.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, there are more than 1,000 troops in the country, torn from the war.
Speaking on the issue of war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were favourable and blamed the unreasonable fears that prevented the arrival of refugees for spreading to some Western countries.
"We started with the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them face up", he said.
They're politicizing something that's purely a humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is an agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, has opened the way for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread penetration of Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would hit jihadist, including Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings will soon convince a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem demanded the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is re-elected for a second term
By this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020, unless impeachment and scandal have ended his presidency sooner, as liberal observers would probably like.
Which should undoubtedly be the most exciting end to the presidency!
At the moment, the spectators show no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled, reaching over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen said Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at its peak hour, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's cable-only "The Rachel Maddow Show" has 3.5 million viewers, keeping its ratings high during the evening's prime time newscasts.
"This is the tension we're being dragged into because we don't understand it", said the head of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about the secretary of state who becomes president when the attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The leader told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He said he'd make me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Unlike other TV shows, the Washington rumours could be fatal to the future of Roe v. Wade and the reuniting of immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the subject is only a luxury for privileged viewers.
But the six-hour expert talk show, which features Bob Woodward's "profound background research" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort's $132,257 "Bomber" jacket (the Washington Post called it "too confident in a breezy suit") and Stormy Daniels's speculation about Mr. Trump's description of the anatomy valley, is more than a trained citizen.
I'll never watch Super Mario again with the same feeling.
"One of his activities that can feel like a reality show is sharing something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "The Banksters", with the show's changing cast and daily schedule (squatting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single shot, or you're out of time.
That week, when Fleiss met me, it was 80 degrees at his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he had stormed into his room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't help watching Brett Kavanaugh get on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember back in the day, we used to do all kinds of crazy shows and people said this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Elsewhere, cash flows are shifting to the most heated White House midterm elections.
No wonder Pennsylvania's 17th district is getting a cash flow from congressional redistricting, putting two market-dominating businesses in the same place.
This led to the re-election of the suburban Pittsburgh district's Democratic Republican representative, Conor Lamb, who won the seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb's opponent is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps in size with the new 17th.
The maps were changed after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which made the old districts unconstitutional, in favor of Republicans.
The 17th election has sparked a campaign where the financial departments of the two largest parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC), are beating each other with money.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the highly-watched March 18 special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat has been held by a Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political opinion makers have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. punished El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, a small setback for Washington.
Mr. Trump met in friendly terms with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varele in June 2017 and owned a Panama hotel until his partners kicked out the Trump corporate management team.
State Department officials decided to recall American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had recently given up support for Taiwan.
But only El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic stimulus, was scheduled to be punished.
The proposed sanctions, including cutbacks in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity to build on a similar meeting last year, seen as a development in efforts to prevent settlers from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted to continue the meeting and end the discussion of any penalties for El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence, who will speak at a mid-October meeting, is now being questioned about the government's position.
And three American ambassadors have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further notice or punishment from Washington.
The White House press secretary for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the domestic discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Teaching history
What might happen next is that special counsel Robert Mueller will release a report on the possible impeachment of Trump, which has plenty of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign is connected to Russia's attack on our election.
If Congress changes sides, Trump will have to report to that body as if he were going to talk to the voters again, and maybe even to his fellow justices.
There are a lot of agas here, and I don't want to suggest that the ouster of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would stop him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We were crushed and left without the possibility of avoiding the years of carnage that followed.
History goes on at such turning points and the relentless march of democracy gets closer or slows down.
Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy D.A. Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since it was reported that he made a proposal to record the president last year and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times's statement is inaccurate.
What if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in federal court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote for Congress in the midterm elections if Trump is to be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me a candle light on a table with a hook.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the Battle of Rapid Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over Australia, following their impressive win over Villarreal earlier this month in Spain, puts them in a strong position to make the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season before the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this as a springboard to get better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a strong opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game, believing we could get something done, and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have done more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we'll get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good run in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I'm sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good run.
Last year was tough, and because of that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling inside.
The team is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move on now, put the last season behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of the fear of pension insurance.
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said that they would discuss the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", explained Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance operations at Nationwide.
That's a good place to start.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare for the care of your family if they do not know your wishes beforehand.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely costly.
Consult your financial adviser: Your adviser may have a good plan for how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or a wealth self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary funds.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop any legal battles you may have.
Get a healthcare authority to appoint a trustee to oversee your care and ensure that specialists follow up on your request if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a trustee in connection with your financial situation.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid even when you are incapacitated.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your aged mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?

The gentleman was shot several times in Ilfracombe with an air rifle.
The gentleman was shot multiple times with a shotgun as he was on his way home from an evening out.
In the 1940s, the victim was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand at Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. last night, as an accidental act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are asking all witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is still rising.
Since the communication has been cut, rescuers have received no information from Donggala Regency, north of Palu, which remains near the epicenter of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Regency is a region extending over 300 km (180 mi) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi Province, especially along the Donggala coast.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern tip of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of Sumatra's islands, Mentawai, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake hit Aceh, Pidie Jaya, causing devastation and panic, reminding people of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
The tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died in collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence reports and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a female was trying to notify the police of the alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Center and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was "not guilty under any circumstances", the news network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged assault, police called his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
Her friend said he hit her in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for associating her son's violent behavior with PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the outskirts of central Sulawesi, just a few miles from Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of the earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu.
In NYC, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a rare terrorist attack suspect.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not carried out for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot car to attack a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and bicyclists on his way in October.
According to the death penalty petitions filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims intentionally and also caused serious bodily injury intentionally.
Both cases are possible death sentences, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on all 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, racketeering, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack presumed "considerable planning and unforeseen events", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "excessive, cruel and disgraceful".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco', is in the will.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the last death in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution took place in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiring to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police say he told investigators he was happy with what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police say he also wanted an ISIS flag displayed on his hospital premises.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of theft.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "clearly disappointed" in the ruling.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the guilty party prolongs the trauma of all involved", Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Tory MP said that NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has promised to mobilize the People's Army during the Tory protest at the conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must have felt the "heat" of the Eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces the challenge of reconciling her deeply divided ranks, which was emphasised by the Remain Conservatives, who joined the city in their anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is having a hard time keeping his Chequers plan on track amidst the Brexiters, the Leftists and the EU's attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels despite the counter-attack, forcing the Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between his package and chaos.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to abandon the Chequers plan.
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'Under his responsibility we would be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough added: 'I am not in favour of Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers plan.'
Reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: We did not fight in the world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: "I'll say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition doesn't vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and vote for us.
Please stop with the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: "Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Farage said the politicians who were at the rally should be made to feel "hot" if they plan to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
"It's now a matter of trust between us, the people and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let that happen.
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel uncomfortable.
We will mobilise the people's army of the country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
Meanwhile, the remnants marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved "Tours against Brexit" slogans after the group was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals mocked the Conservatives for the security issues that were part of their party's implementation of the opening conference.
'These are people who say they can put IT systems in place and bring all the technology to Canada and, more importantly, to Ireland for smooth cross-border, unrestricted trade,' he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future Saturday at the Western Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running in the November election against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign vice chairman.
There's speculation that he might run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday's early afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
A bystander asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for the women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means the front-line.
The LSU Sims shooting resulted in an arrest.
LAPD in Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday has been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at around 11 a.m. today at the ET news conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed outside Southern University City Hall early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and he confessed to being at the scene, possession of a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 6-foot-two Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them as a starter, averaging 17.4 minutes, while shooting 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after a team record gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on, it became clear that Walter Bottas qualified Saturday against Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team's lineup would play a big role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, almost overwhelming Hamilton as he defended his position on his first two attempts and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stops first, leaving the Hamilton group behind in the heavy traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit stop later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after the side position when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the passing lane open after a third corner attempt to protect it with a double-slip.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving towards the finish in rubber sweaters and passing Kimi Räikkönen, taking fourth place.
He finally made the pit stop on lap 44, but failed to increase speed in the last eight laps, which gave Räikkönen fourth place.
Today is a tough day because Walter did a great job all week and was a real gentleman in letting me pass.
"The team has done a great job getting one of the two", said Hamilton.
That was very poor body language.
President Donald Trump joked at Senator Dianne Feinstein's meeting on Saturday about the incident that she had not leaked a letter to Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what is happening in the Senate right now, which shows that people are "evil, nasty and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the only beautiful thing that's happening right now, that's happened in the Senate in the last couple of days, is that you're seeing people who are angry and angry and mean and ugly and lying", he said.
If you look at the press releases and the leaks, you're like, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question "Did you leak the document?"
Oh, no, I know.
I didn't leak.
Hold on a second.
Did we leak... no, we didn't", he added with a senator's face.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the allegations against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill reported, "I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations or leak his story", Feinstein told the committee.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and at his request, I did.
But his denial didn't sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: "You know what, that was very poor body language".
Maybe he didn't, but that's one of the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually abusing three women, the president suggested that the Democrats are using the charges to their own ends.
They've decided to take power back without a choice of means.
You see this wickedness and disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to cross to get power and control,
In the Elite League, the Dundee Stars 5 - 3 the Belfast Giants
Giant Patrick Dwyer scored two against Dundee
The Dundee Stars won the re-match on Saturday against the Belfast Giants, who lost to Dundee 5-3 on aggregate.
The Giants entered the game early with two goals to go, led by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to victory before Dwyer took the Giants back to the pennant.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's goals secured their victory.
It was the third loss in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's men, who came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee 2-1 in the final.
It was the fourth meeting of the season, and the Giants have won three of the last six.
Dwyer's opening goal came at 3:35 in the fourth minute with the help of Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought home the home team's fastest 13:10 in the first quarter before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the score at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants led before the first break by hitting his second goal of the night at the end of the first quarter.
On the home court, the players regrouped and Bouchard put them back on level by scoring a goal in the 27th minute, 37 minutes ahead of the majority.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the second-third, securing victory in the final third in their team's offensive zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in the next home game.
A pilot dies to save hundreds of people from an earthquake.
An Indonesian pilot was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday triggered a tsunami that killed more than 800 people, many of whom are still missing.
Strong aftershocks are hitting the area and many people are trapped in the city of Palu under the rubble.
Despite the fact that 21 year old Anthony Gunawan Agung's colleagues escaped from the wobbly airlock at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on duty to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We have prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palus.
"We were extremely saddened to hear about it", the spokesman added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, according to the state's disaster mitigation agency, which has restricted access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "The death toll may rise as the bodies of many victims are still under the rubble and have not been recovered".
The 20-foot waves devastated the town of Palu, where a mass funeral is being held on Sunday.
Military and air travel provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance is bringing in new victims.
Clean water is rare.
Everywhere, they're looting the markets.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we can't say what they might find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palus on Sunday and told the country's military: I ask you to work day and night to carry out all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck the Indonesian city of Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia air crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after plane crashes into lagoons
While it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane, the airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they had not been able to locate a male passenger.
The airline said they're working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to questions about the passenger's details, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at the Chuuki Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday but were in stable condition.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"It's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers managed to slide into the water in the sinking plane and onto the emergency exit.
He mentioned that the salon attendant was panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The United States Navy and sailors working on a nearby pier also assisted in the rescue, using inflatable boats to take people ashore before the plane sank some 100 feet [30 m] below the water.
The Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in the past two decades in airline-related accidents registered in PNG, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst's putting together a calendar for the night the woman was burned alive.
The U.S. Attorney's Office on Saturday concluded a review of the case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the United States Department of Justice, spent several hours analyzing intelligence as an expert observer.
He brought to the jury how he used cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old plaintiff Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she got location information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted the young man's earlier claims.
When the records showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why he went to the police to talk to Sanford.
Sanford walked into the courtroom Saturday and confessed that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had been telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis had lied because my car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Phone records show the couple had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased the girl from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to make its arraignment on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: what is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to fight the negative definition of the genre by adding positive messages to the music.
Bristol-based The High Breed argues that hip-hop has moved away from its original political messages and social problem-solving.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Bands like The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A New York nanny sues a couple for a racist message.
A New York nanny is suing for discriminatory dismissal after a couple accidentally received a text from the family, in which the mother complained that the nanny was "another black".
The couple denies being racist, compared to the situation of blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her anger when it was revealed that their new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came on the job in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying, "Ellllllllllllllll, again black".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, an uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice after his profanity, claiming that their social nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for severance pay, which he wants to get at $350 a day for the next six months, and the same job he was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that look, so do", he told The Post, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have denied the allegations of racism, saying that terminating their employment with Maurice was a wise move because they feared that after the girl was insulted, they could no longer trust him.
My wife sent him something he didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post.
But would you let your children be taken in by a man you've been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
All right, now.
Commenting on the comparison to blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from giving birth and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you go up against someone like that?
"It's not very nice", the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, where they are heavily criticized for their behavior and thinking.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not associate with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was published, wrote: "It is difficult to put myself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it is published.
It's a lot of fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success.
He said that his father, having been inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was due to his father's death last year from drowning.
Of Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family", he added that his father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man and not a proud man", he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like when your child accomplishes something, you're proud of them, even if it's not your achievement.
I believe he viewed Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon arrival, his daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
"They called regularly to say that her daughter was in very bad condition and that they did not think she would survive", said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nadie, who said my daughter was gonna die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, honey, I love you so much.
See you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The drugs doctors had given him to keep his heart beating had been slowly disappearing and leaving his body.
He was dead a little while before that, and now all the systems are starting to shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold it together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her ordeal.
"But nobody knew that", he said.
I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of compassion for Nad on that flight.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.
Postcards from a Snoring Woman Prevent Suicide on the Bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide nail work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted cards on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile made the room shine.
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died, because he was in a very bad place with the om.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that this is having a domino effect".
Miss Davis created these cards to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even your friends.
Don't be quiet. You have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davis for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything, he said.
We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day. When the kids opened their presents, he didn't have any eye contact or anything.
Mrs. Humphreys said that the death of her husband was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it:
It's going to tear us apart.
But we must keep going and keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted, a limited time and scope of investigation, we might be able to reach a consensus", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "crowd together" amid a persistent partisan gridlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans don't do as well as they've hoped, they'll be significantly weakened in their bid to get the man they want to lead the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits their report?
The vote is in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear at this time whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
North Korean troops are shrinking under Kim's government
South Korean lawmakers have said the number of North Korean troops in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 troop numbers (2706), their number has decreased last year (1127).
Mr. Park said the main factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and increased numbers of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean troops have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul News, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest state border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China takes in military personnel as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of the nuclear weapons that were already in place.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress on sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, our country has no security and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm first", Mr Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" man, saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House of Representatives Opposition Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said the man is "temperamentally unfit" to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I felt it inevitable that if any woman had acted in this way, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, describing his family and high school years, and occasionally almost screaming and sometimes being left speechless.
He also condemned the Democratic Party members on the committee, calling the accusations against him over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat "grotesque and coordinated defamation" organized by angry liberals.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that the man was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were confirmed, should the Democrats win a majority in the House.
"I'm telling you as much as I do, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to be a Supreme Court justice, he's unfit to be on the court where he's currently serving", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterically bent person to become a judge and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great?'" Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, months and years of overflowing anger, and he can't help but cry.
"We cry when we get angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She continued: "I got help from a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said that she cried when she got angry, but she developed a method where when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.'
I'm mad at you.
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius.
Tears are partly accepted as an expression of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is of an early job in a male-dominated office where I found myself crying in indescribable rage as an older woman - a strict leader whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the collar and led me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're mad at the frogs.
They think you're sad, and it gives them satisfaction.
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on the man's presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a yacht called Monkey Business and ended his campaign, deeply upset Schroeder thought there was no reason why he should not consider running for president himself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
Juba had seven candidates running and the last thing they needed was for someone else to join.
Someone said it was like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was winding down, he was late with the fundraiser and promised not to run unless he got the two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He found out that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, feelings of  gratitude to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it difficult to raise money and appeal to voters instead of delegates, and hatred of sexism  got so much of a hold on her that she was in tears.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled the press reaction to him.
You'd think Kleenex would be my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my headstone.
Did she cry?
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening stages of the US-China trade war have been bleak, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the cross-border divide may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200bn (£150bn) worth of goods, essentially imposing tariffs on half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has responded in the same way each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate with a bullet to the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to blink any time soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean yielding to demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing gets its cards right, a trade war with the United States could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that cause the economy of another country to lose control is actually far more dangerous than outsiders have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to welcome refugees back.
Syria says it is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
'The situation on the territory of the country is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government will continue to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to bring the situation back to normal.
The conditions are now in place for refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods to return voluntarily.
The UN estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept aid to rebuild the devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the state would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team at Le Golf National near Paris, France, with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown, with Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scoring the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the US star of the tournament, kicked a par-3 at the 16th hole, giving the win to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his spells, becoming one of only four players to have achieved a 5-0-0 record in the current format, which began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the lowest placed Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has been 2-0 ahead of England's Ian Poulter, who may have lost the Ryder Cup.
Of the eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the European's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we got the trophy back.
"It's about team spirit and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, emotional after winning Europe.
He's handing the torch to compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the singles on Sunday against U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1.
"I feel an extraordinary pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major championships, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The US team was busy finding fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury, after the disappointing performance of the crew, said, "I'm proud of the boys, they were brave.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players did a great job.
Let's get our heads together, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to lighten the hat.
We were played better.
New information on water runoff: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a decline in the overall concentration of flowering algae in the Tampa Bay area.
FWC has reported more sluggish blooms in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating decreasing concentrations.
The watershed extends approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The bodies can be found 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the numbers are down from last week.
Water leaks have also been reported in Pasco County.
