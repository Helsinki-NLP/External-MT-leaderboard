According to the Tatoeba guidelines, members are advised to either add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose natural-sounding sentences in your native language. When we write in a language other than our native language, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. Please translate a sentence only if you are sure what it means.

He died.
They died in battle.
He died ten years ago.
The woman he married is very beautiful.
My wife left me in October.
The woman denied everything.
Women need to feel like they can do whatever job they want.
Women are not interested in him.
Women like tea.
Women don't care about him.
I asked him if he'd kick my back.
She asked me if I was okay.
She asked me if I knew the woman personally.
They asked if they should write down new words.
They asked Tom if he felt safe with them.
I asked them where the train station was.
I asked Tom where he went.
I asked Tom where I should drop him off.
He asked if he was coming.
He asked if he was coming.
Let's ask Tom about it.
You should ask Tom.
Ask your mother.
He raised the volume so everyone could hear.
He's got a little radio.
He grew old, grey, and divorced, but he also became rich and famous.
He tried his best not to think about her.
I didn't like him at first.
Turn it off, please.
Get the fuck out of here!
She lost weight.
We live alone.
We've lived in this town since 1960.
Do you like living here?
He lives comfortably.
I live modestly.
I live in the city.
I live in a community where most people can walk to work.
The giraffe was hurt.
I've made a lot of new friends.
I'm working tomorrow.
I'll work in the garden tomorrow.

I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
Tomorrow is a holiday.
I won't see her tomorrow.
I'll buy everything I need tomorrow.
We're closed tomorrow.
It's my birthday tomorrow.
It's my birthday tomorrow.
I'm going to be 28 tomorrow.
You can't help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day.
I'm going to the funeral tomorrow.

Life is hard as a banker.
Life is a riddle and love is the answer.
Life is like a soap bubble.
Life is beautiful!
Life is good.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
Life is hard and difficult.
Life is wonderful.
Life is a great suffering.
Life is not easy.
Life isn't just about work.
Life will go on as normal.
Life doesn't always turn out the way you want it to.
They're thirsty for glory.
What city are Marco and Maria from?
What chapter is this verse from?
Find out where Tom went.
Find out where Tom went.
We found out where he lives.
Did we find out who the woman is?
Did you find out where Tom went?
I found the food a little spicy.
I found out my bike was gone.
Did you find out how old Tom is?
She got so sick from the bus ride, she started throwing up.
You've let me down.
You let Tom down.
Who are you afraid of?
Check to see if you forgot anything.
Check it out for me, please.
I tried everything.
I tried everything.
You motherfuckers!
Experience brings wisdom.
She tried it on herself.
I've tried everything I can.
He tried to get her attention.
I'll try to do something about it.
Try to have some compassion.
Try not to be a fool.
Try talking to the police.
Try it yourself.
Try not to take it so hard.
Try to control yourself.
Try this!
Try explaining it to Tom.
Try it again.
The evil witch cursed the man and turned him into a bug.
Gold is a precious metal.
Gold is heavier than silver.

She pissed him off.
I'm mad at Tom.
The criminals managed to escape.
The criminal tracked down and killed Tom.
You broke your leg.
He changed his address.
Did I miss something?
It's not an exaggeration on my part.
She disappeared into the dark.
He disappeared without a trace.
He disappeared into the crowd.
He disappeared from the face of the earth.
Get out of here!
They've ruined it.
He knows them.
He knows them.
Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.
I know him, that's why I don't trust him.
I know him very well, because I saw him often in his father's office.
I know his name.
I only know a few words.
I know her by name.
I know both girls.
I know the truth.
I know the real reason you're here.
I know Tom's wife.
I know the area.
I know your little brother very well.
Rape is a terrible crime.
You know me well enough to know I wouldn't do that.
Do you know any of these men?
You know everybody here, right?

Do you know the answer?
He knows it like the back of his hand.
Does anybody know this guy?
He knows wine.
Pollution can be controlled.
For some reason, I feel more alive at night.
Suddenly the captain left the ship.
She took advantage of my ignorance.
They're using me.
You're abusing your authority.
Destroy your enemies: make them your friends.
You'll be happy again.
I told them again to turn the radio down.
I'll read it again.
Snow and rain fell from the sky.
Juggling is another thing I'm not very good at.
They screwed up.
They sing in the choir.
She was singing a song, smiling at me.
I wasn't attracted to her at first.
A cat came from under the desk.
Two boys came running from the room.
The news of Tom's death saddened me.
I've caused him a lot of trouble.
She betrayed me.
A ripe apple fell from the tree.
I got hurt.
The mirror is rusted.
The mirror is fogged.
The mirror broke.
They've started a new company in London.
I hardly ever see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd cancel all the slaughterhouses if I could.
You canceled the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
Cancel the meeting.
She blushed her face.
We can learn a lot of valuable information from that book.
You've gained weight.
I wouldn't joke about that.
Tom is a man now.
He's wasting his time.
Losing her job, which she loved so much, was a blow to her.
We lost all our gear.
He lost it.
I lost the umbrella Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost the umbrella Tom gave me for my birthday.
I lost my key.
I lost all my friends.
You've lost your head, haven't you?
He lost two sons in the war.
You're wasting your time.
Losing the job she loved so much was a terrible blow.
She blunted the knife.
They were in on it.
I was in the debate.
I was part of the search.
I'd stay and chat, but I have to go.
They stayed in Tennessee.
We were quiet.
Stay in the house.
You staying or you leaving?
You staying or you leaving?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and lock the door.
Stay right there!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay in your house.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay at the motel.
I'm staying with you.
Curiosity got the best of me.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get up out of the chair and help!
We'll call you.
We can do better.
Can you do it by yourself?
Can you do it by yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
I chose the path of least resistance.
My phone is ringing!
The bells rang.
The bells started ringing.
They screwed up.
I twisted my ankle.
We get used to everything.
I'll get used to it.
Habit is second nature.
I used to live alone.
I used to win.
He's gotten used to not having hot food every day.
You get used to everything.
You'll get used to it.
