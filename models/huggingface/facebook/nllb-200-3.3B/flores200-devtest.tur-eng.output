Not only does this confirm the existence of feathers in at least some dinosaurs, which is an already existing theory, but it also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils generally cannot.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers are pale or carotenoid at the bottom of the body and chestnut-brown at the top.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed stalk called a bird feather stalk but did have other feather features, such as hooks and hinges, researchers concluded that the bird feather stalk was probably an evolutionary development that developed later than these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and imaging purposes, and the researchers say that although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers rather than juvenile feathers.
Although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers claimed that it was not a chick's feathers, for example, but adult feathers.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in the Turkish city of Gaziantep yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be due to the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Arrow.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a similar way to the light ring around the galaxy, and is composed of many small-sized particles.

Voting in France is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters are left alone in a booth, putting a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that shows the candidate they have chosen.
Once the authorities have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the box and signs the voter list.
French election law regulates the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can confirm that there were no envelopes in the ballot boxes at the beginning of voting, and that no envelopes were added to the boxes except those that were properly considered and approved by voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every step of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under intensive observation following certain procedures.

Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused had hidden his face in the courtroom.
There were three people in the house when the car hit, but none of them were hurt.
However, the driver was badly injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency responders were removing the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, who was charged with the murder of his son, has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
He is awaiting indictment and trial, but the image has been widely circulated, and the evidence presented by eyewitnesses could be compromised.
This is common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish courts have found the publication of the photographs to be potentially objectionable.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University says that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Royal Office, which is responsible for the meetings, has told reporters that no further comment will be made until at least the indictment is prepared.
The leaked document allegedly refers to the border dispute in which Palestine demanded a return to the borders that existed before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Other issues covered include the future Jerusalem state, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that the valley be occupied by troops for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine agrees to limit this requirement to five years.
The hunters participating in the supplemental insecticide trial were scheduled to be closely monitored by rangers while the trial was observed and its effectiveness assessed.
The NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. worked together to recruit qualified volunteers to join the team as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Deputy Director of Park Conservation Mick O'Flynn and the NPWS Legacy, the four hunters selected for the initial hunting operation have received extensive safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This will be Martelly's fifth Provisional Election Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of CEP as part of a package of measures to force the country into a new election.
Martelly responded with this commission to the highly attended anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
The failure to hold the necessary elections has set the stage for sometimes violent protests, some of which have been expected since 2011.
There were about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, resulting in six fires in total and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has announced that it is aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 new extreme heat events and that the company had rated them "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really sad".
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Office of Emergency Management says there are no reports of any damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has kidnapped a bus in the Philippine capital of Manila, taking hostages from Hong Kong tourists.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
At least six people have been confirmed dead in the rescue of a large number of hostages so far.
All six hostages, including children and elderly, were released along with Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers replaced an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and gynaecology and began her residency at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins, while working at the hospital, began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if administered, the hormone would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna, died one night two months old, just as she was, quite unique, powerful woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even more so... and I love her and I miss her... and I hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should come to a republican betrayal at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the polling stations, 31 percent believe that Australia should never be a republic, while 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should be a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the three flag events at the British Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness is in doubt.
He couldn't get the medicine he needed to ease his pain because he was banned from the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known on January 25.
In early February, many people using different hardware and software confirmed this discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could be the source of the water that makes up proteins and brings life to the Earth, along with the organic matter that could sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, were formed by the collision of comets with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political babble and stupidity".
There's been speculation that he'll be a candidate for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to more precisely locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No extra service, no overground trains at Wembley, no cars on the surface, and no facilities for the thousands.
Fearing the lack of transportation, the match was likely to be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's spinous, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus spinous, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, rolled into small shapes.
It can be twisted into a thin wire that can be twisted into a sheet, or it can be beaten into a plate.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, so thin that it's sometimes used in books to decorate hand-painted paintings called "deity".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can use the juice of red cabbage to make an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H) ions in the test chemical (pH in H).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have their electrons removed, because hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron.
Mix two tablespoons of dry powder, then shape it into a ball with clean, wet hands.
It's going to react with the moisture in your hands, the outer layers, and it's going to give you a fun feeling, and it's going to create a kind of crust in your hand.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a drainage system connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In the Greek cities of Minos on the islands of Crete and Santorini, the remains of a sewage system were found in the houses.
In ancient Egypt, Iran, and China, toilets were also a part of the bathroom, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the bathhouse, where men and women were mixed together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite as a vehicle.
The satellite in space picks up the call and reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing it's done for us is make it much easier and faster to get around.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
At the bottom of these, there are more moderate-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domesticated cats that have been released) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has and which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
A lion herd consists of about thirty adult cousins, ranging from one to three males, with a female and a cub.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are part of a larger family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave in a manner very similar to wolves or dogs, which are animals that behave surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera), the only four cat species that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the full-on roar of a lion, but it's much more like a rattle, a phrase made up of shouting words.
The ocelots love to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find other animals for food by sensing where they are on the ground, by sniffing.
With their night vision, they can see very well at night and they can also be extremely stealthy.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the population from which they came (for example, if they go beyond a ridge or a river, or go to a new island where it will not be easy to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, meaning that the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they had previously.
The original population has not changed, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to look more and more different from the other populations.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years later, these two animals will look too different to be the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants get their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its day, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were filled with teeth with more than 70 razor-sharpening teeth, along with an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue, and that its diet included turtles, large fish and other mosasaurs, and perhaps it was also eating its own kind.
He also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex.
Although we are familiar with much of their food, the Romans received their share of strange or unusual banquets, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the nut-rat.
Another difference was that the poor and women liked to sit in chairs and eat their meals, while the rich men liked to sit side by side and eat their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that would come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and they had never tasted any ancient Roman turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each god, which was considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which can only be entered by the priests.
Special pyramidal towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home wasn't all that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women ate in the garden; shops were just open stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan lacked large forests, so the price of wood was exorbitant.
Greenland is sparsely settled, and in Norse legends, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and to have found Greenland and named it Greenland while travelling west.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence had the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776" written on the back, which is shown upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment scroll (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for the purpose of concealment.
So it's likely that the information is simply added as a label.
The Normandy Expedition and subsequent wars liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was run by the Vichy French, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a substantially large group of people, a society, who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning 'civil', and is related to the Latin civis, meaning 'citizen', and civitas, meaning 'city' or 'city-state', and also describes the size of a community.
City states are the precursors of nations, and civilization is the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and a fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence of themselves and are not considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first established a weak central government under the Confederate Constitution, and Congress was the only component of that government.
Congress had no taxing power, and with no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on often uncooperative state officials to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The amendments required the unanimous consent of all the states, and the states so underestimated the central government that their representatives were often not in office.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful in the world, after the German national football team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Football, basketball, volleyball, softball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skate hockey, and F1 motor racing are among the popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have about 7,000 islands, the largest being Honshu, which makes Japan the 7th largest island on earth!
Because of its island group, Japan is often referred to as a "supercontinent" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's turning point dates back to a period in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a plant in southwestern Taiwan, a change in the local grain production methods, and employed Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683 Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Macchu Picchu consists of three main structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the facility have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common form of still image photography in the world is 35 mm, the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, it gets its en-boy ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
It's a bit confusing that the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio is divided by ten to find the number) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this en-boy ratio.
The oft-overused and often-overlooked rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamism in a photograph while maintaining scale.
The most effective area for the main subject is the point of convergence of the lines that divide the image into three longitudinal and horizontal lines (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was brought under control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had held the nations of Europe together despite their differences in language and traditions.
His all-pervasive power has affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the most important beliefs of Christianity is the use of wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's capital is used specifically for this purpose.
The centralization of power and money in Rome, the seat of the church's authority for over a millennium, has led many to question whether the church has been acting in accordance with this principle.
Immediately after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
Although the siege violates international law, which has been accepted as the general law of many international treaties over the last two centuries, it has been strategically effective and has prevented the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain has even endangered neutral ships by laying mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the U-boat war that was unleashed.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and the nation was one of pacifism and isolationism.
The nations that had witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I wanted to avoid facing such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company, located in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with a 4-cent notebook, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each period of China or each ruling family is a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability, with each dynasty divided into regions, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, there were fierce battles between many nobles fighting for the throne.
In one of the bloodiest periods of ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms Period, thousands died fighting for the top position in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Again, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, with the ambitious and successful one winning.
The same is true for the army, because the army ranks are now based on Cailaber, not class.
The French Revolution inspired many members of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life, and he often went to a cave on Mount Nur, later called Hira, to meditate.
The cave itself, which is from that time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if it's known to exist, it's not easy to find, and it's completely isolated inside the cave.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family heirlooms.
The upper arrow mark is a V-shaped figure, and the "lower arrow" appears as a plaster or a missing square below.
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the bow and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own markings with the pencil, but remember that these arrow-pulling markings are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to follow them.
The terrified King Louis XVI, his two young children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles, Queen Marie Antoinette and the King's sister Madam Elizabeth were forcibly deported from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a large group of women.
They returned to Paris in a car, surrounded by a group of people who were shouting and making threats against the King and the Queen.
The human race forced the King and Queen to open the car windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been beaten at Versailles in front of a frightened queen.
The war costs of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the interest and expenses of the bonds that were being held by the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Without a doubt, the extra profit made from years of exploitation of the Filipino people is among the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the sect.
The period of time in which the events occur mostly refers to the High Middle Ages, which is the time span of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries in European history (1000-13000 AD).
The High Middle Ages were coming before the Early Middle Ages, and were followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500, when the agreement ended.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very wide range of ideas in practice, including views such as the technological drive or the inevitability of technology, which holds that human destiny is determined by a logic associated with the unconscious by scientific laws and the application of these laws in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has some "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car was necessarily the precursor to the development of roads.
But having a nationwide road infrastructure is not economically viable if there are fewer vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of vehicle ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the road, which leads to new techniques in the health sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism was characterized by a broad cultural determinism that passed through writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, traditions and culture related to that geography emerged that were more in tune with the place where the society was located and were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was considered the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Around 400 C.E., it gained a reputation as a center of luxury and maintained this reputation until about 1100 C.E.
The status of the crusaders declined in the twelfth century as they returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
The title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris in these years.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries and reached its peak in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to form its own style, and one of the great advances of the period, with the end of the Crusades, was the introduction of the use of buttons to seam clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is the agricultural practice of producing only enough food to meet the needs of the person engaged in the agricultural activity and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and mostly organic system whereby conserved seeds specific to the ecological region and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods are used to obtain maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture often express their identity as part of that culture using a distinct and symbolic style, often incorporating fashion, attitude, and slang.
One of the most common ways that we use to illustrate the importance of socialization is to highlight a few unfortunate cases of children who were socialized by adults who were neglectful, unwilling, or intentionally abusive.
Some wild children have been confined to enclosed spaces by humans (often their own parents), in some cases because the parents rejected the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to live alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, a feral child exhibits behavior (as far as physical limitations permit) that is almost entirely similar to that of the animal that raised it, such as fear of humans or insensitivity to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easy and interesting, mentoring goes one step further.
Guidance support is not a learning method but a support to individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The guidance assistant can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a guide, but so is the little attache in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are embedded in software and are meant to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that a student might find challenging to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even assault.
No child should grow up in a place that is not protective, compassionate, and nurturing, but unfortunately, that is not the case.
We see the Protective Family System as a safe zone for these kids.
Our expectations of our foster family system are safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Child support is obliged to meet all the requirements that were not previously met in the host home.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add a dimension to the approach to use and enjoyment.
For example, learning and socialization are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to websites, personal involvement and implicated relationships were also identified as new incentive elements by Eighmey and McCord (1998).
The use of video images has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
It is suggested that a particular method of correctly interpreting microexpressions can be used to determine whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article called The President's Speech, noted that people who have trouble perceiving speech properly because of brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly.
He even claims that animals, like pet dogs, may have this kind of ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the latent and the extrinsic.
The mutation creates new genetic differences, and selection removes that from the expressed pool of differences.
In each generation, the separation and re-merging between the two pools confuses the variation back and forth.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would have difficulty meeting its amino acid requirements with available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences, such as growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be proteins from leaves and legumes, but it's unlikely that plants would be digested by primates like us without being cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
So, all things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and falling back to sleep after a short period (about 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quieter alarm clock to just keep your conscious mind clear without waking you up completely from your sleep.
If you find yourself setting the alarm again in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn off the alarm.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep and forcing someone to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and his spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that's stopping us from achieving it is our own stress and negativity.
Buddhism is a teaching based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques taken from Tibetan Yoga.
The principle of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's a path of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is the practice of awakening the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga, where the visualization of various gods clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a partner in World War II, and that led to the cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, the system, the process, and the cultural clashes divided the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was really going to be fought by proxy armies for the next 40 years in war zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered invalid almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded and opened up the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after the Soviet Union invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to protect the ability of your country to carry your people and goods, and to interfere with the ability of the enemy to carry its people and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples of this was the North Atlantic front of World War II, where the Americans were trying to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to deliver aid to Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably taken Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to feed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and mail.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds roaming on hills or other pasture areas, often herded by goat herders, usually children or adolescents, in a manner similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
Wagonways were not built in England until the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were only parallel wooden pallets, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than the somewhat more rugged tracks of the day.
Travers were used to hold rails in place at a very early date, but over time it was discovered that rails could be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the iron carriages.
As a result, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were put into use.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago with the advent of Homo erectus, which means upright man.
The previous generation of Australopithecus could not walk normally on two legs.
The first use of two feet is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally consciously, join environmental movements, or even become activists to reduce the problems of the future a little bit.
It's like symptomatic therapy in most cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and neutralize it.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly because of man's scientific and technological advances, and that problems have been made worse by overpopulation and mankind's extravagant way of life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4th, the manuscript, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Clerk Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Now known as the "Dunlap broadsides", 150 to 200 copies of the notices were produced in one night.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6 to be read by his soldiers in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The earliest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap pamphlets, of which no original handwritten version has survived.
Now, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, and we call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have feet and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind feet like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the exchange of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of the values 0 and 1, called bits in the field of information technology.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The most important sign of internal intoxication is the presence of an open medicine can or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the venom in question.
The term insect is used officially by entomologists for this type of insect.
The term is derived from its ancient similarity to the bed bug, which has adapted to establish a parasitic relationship with humans.
Both the Killer Bug and the Bed Bug are juveniles that have adapted to living in their homes or nests.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which means that MS is the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that having children is not in their own best interests or in the child's.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
When adoption is being processed, the adoptive parents terminate parental rights so that the child's family can be another couple.
The fundamental purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the direction of most scientific research.
But experiments are not alone. Experiments are tests used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classics, especially the Bible in Latin.
He accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including the science of the soul.
As Greek science declined, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and movement are largely dependent on the existence of internal cycles, and the production of these cycles through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responsive to external periodic cues, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of free rotation even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, labeling DNA in either radioactive phosphorus phage or radioactive sulfur protein phage.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can affect children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on the ground include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small country towns by car to go to work, passing other workers who are on their way to where they left a moment ago.
In these dynamic inter-city travels, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this huge carbon economy is disrupting the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
You rarely hear about similar complaints in developed countries, like water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are transportation systems receiving so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transportation engineers incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to work on traffic flow because the driver's behavior can't be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably stable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have an acceptable consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main properties are defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate railway facilities.
The first animals to fly were insects, whose ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily, and find food and mates more easily with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them a wider and smaller range of hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are fireflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; they believed that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon, at over six miles wide, is also the largest river on Earth.
Exactly 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramid construction lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of their structures.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom looked back in awe at the monuments left by their predecessors, and these monuments were more than a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country and the least populated country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language spoken by most of the people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Since early times, humans have had knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, all of which can be discovered in their original state in nature and extracted with relatively simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things were made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but it also theorizes that they can transform into new materials to take the forms we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals, so keep in mind that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of amethylamine elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
In short, the pencil, when it first came out, was a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pen's use and frequency decreased.
People are now writing messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a stylus.
Who knows what's going to happen to the keyboard when something new comes out?
A fission bomb works by taking energy to bring together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a sense, this process is like lifting a handcart up a hill, and then the core recharges and then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can be broken down with little or no intervention.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The earth's crust is about 70 km thick nearby and 100 km thick farther away.
It's thinner underneath the Maria, thicker in the mountains.
The crust is thinner, so there's more maria on the side, and it's easier for lava to come up to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding things that trigger or attract people.
These theses reveal that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories deal with what causes some people to desire the things they do and what causes their surroundings to do or not do certain things to them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may occur when managers start to love and manage their former colleagues: one side of the equation is trying to stay in the shape of "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
These types of managers have difficulty making decisions that are unpopular, taking disciplinary action, performing performance reviews, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks that everything the team does should be changed and that he should do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as consultants for their close physical group.
Because virtual teams can meet on varying time frames that may not be understood by local authorities, they often have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, where each member reports to the other, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of creating a learning organization?
Creativity and mastery can emerge when all possible resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
In conclusion, an organization's process of working together to overcome a hurdle can be the precursor to a new innovative process that will serve the needs of customers.
To be innovative, an organisation must create a culture of innovation, as well as encouraging leadership, knowledge sharing and in-house training.
Melek (2006) describes the Sustainability approach, a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the exploration of cognition, and so narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior has supported scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material support to design simulation models that help us solve the workings of our minds.
While AI has a strong resemblance to science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing robots that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, customer diagnostics and answering questions; handwriting, voice and facial recognition skills.
Each of these skills has become a separate discipline focused on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, as well as in home computers and video game software.
School trips are an important part of all classes, and teachers often love to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology provides the solution by offering a virtual tour, where students can study museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or be enchanted by beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a school trip in a virtual environment is a great way to share thoughts and experiences about the trip with other classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their annual trips to the state capitol, the website is re-designed every year, but old versions are kept online to be used as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling errors, the presence of a reading audience often changes that.
Since the most critical audience is usually students, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them".[22] The need for followers to nurture their interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that opens up collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school curriculum.
The appropriate use of blogs "may enable students to be more analytical and critical; students may be able to actively respond to online material, and determine their own position in the context of others' writings and their own view on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, Ottawa, has many art galleries and museums that reflect Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more undermines the way Ontario is being labeled as a Canadian by outsiders.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost deserted wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: the number of African Americans in the United States is greater than the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of eastern Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of the islands, and it's a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or dependencies of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it became very widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that every female traveler, regardless of actual civic status, state that she is married.
You may also find it helpful to wear a ring (not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences can result in what they would label as harassment, and that it's not unusual to be followed, to be held in the arms, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to say no (even if there are cultural differences, it doesn't mean it's right!).
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids as a strategic port, under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was later named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centers in the city.
If you want to shop in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least attractive places.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products like tajin, pottery, leather goods, nargils and various trinkets, but these are always for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Even though Goma is reasonably secure, all visits from outside Goma should be investigated in order to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
The city, which has some of the cheapest Mount Gori hiking trails in Africa, is also a base for those who want to climb Nyiragongo volcano.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The normal (local) price is about 500 CFA for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city that attracts tourists with its fame and an airport, but it is a poor city.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
The PBS special was one of Henry Louis Gates' most important stops during the African World's Wonders.
The city is in complete contrast to other cities in the country due to the Arab air rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is formed by the Timsah River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
As well as being one of South Africa's most popular attractions, it is also the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entry fees for the park.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card that provides access to various parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is considered by many visitors to be the main focal point.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a glittering columnar graph that is made even more prominent by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon beach across the way.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been derived from extensive land reclamation along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists took it for themselves, and so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Stretching for 50 miles from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India, the Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world.
Sundarban has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The remaining part of the forest within the boundaries of India is called Sundarban National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2 (1,950 sq mi), about a third of which is in wetlands/swamps.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and an estimated 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-regional bus stop (across the river) during the day, but most depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance, as inter-regional buses are often full.
Most of the neighborhoods are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a speedy and comfortable means of transportation to nearby places such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and the town of Siant-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 metres high, with two lanes 378 metres long and 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in the territory of what is now eastern Paraguay, as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to the Guaycurú, Payaguá, and other indigenous tribes, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly called the "Great Land of the Indians", Paraguay was formed in the 16th century as a result of Spanish conquerors' encounters with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Paraguay has managed to largely preserve its indigenous identity and character since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world and the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is pegged to one British pound sterling (GBP).
You know, the only bank on the islands, Stanley, across from the FIC West store, has a currency exchange.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also generally accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on remote islands, but sterling and U.S. dollars may be used. Consult the owners in advance to determine the accepted payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands pound outside the islands, so change your money before you leave.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropical climate zone, with temperatures above 30°C common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make you feel colder than your thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct seasons that can be described as rainy and "dry".
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and the animals should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials say you should stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid storing or cooking smelly food and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the harbor by showing their hulls, thus giving the port its unfortunate reputation.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, with about 200 Americans and Germans lost.
A peaceful meeting in the town during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement resulted in the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because of Auckland's position in the middle of two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa tree.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located between the Waitemata Harbour, the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay, and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a wide variety of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a very sophisticated beer, but it's nice and refreshing, and the other local beer is called Manta.
Although there's plenty of French wine to drink, New Zealand and Australian wines might be better.
Drinking the local tap water is perfectly safe, but if you're afraid of it, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is alien to Australians. It is a short black 'espresso', the cappuccino comes with high cream (not spiced) as a topping, and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian by standards, the juices are expensive but delicious.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and for these reasons, injuries are very rare.
Nevertheless, consult with the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear north of 1770 from October to April near the shores and near the river banks, and occasionally outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they attack humans very rarely, and most of them are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean all the time, their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to feel comfortable knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also choose other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transfers, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to provide other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they may hold your reservation for you.
Any changes or requests must be communicated to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp out on the festival grounds, and most attendees see this as an important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you must go ahead to capture a campsite near the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music has stopped on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the Baltic in the winter, make sure you know where the cabin is, because crossing through the ice makes a terrible noise for the sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city, and tourist cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by guests, often without windows or clocks, and it may not be easy to find the exits.
To keep the guests in good spirits and to please them, there are usually special food, drink, and entertainment.
Some establishments may serve alcoholic beverages, but getting drunk can affect your judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving on high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is quite low and it is not possible to drive on dry asphalt.
Snow may fall quickly enough to keep you stuck in the snow during blizzards.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall, snowfall, condensation in vehicle windows, or icing.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic usually flows uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The common usage of the term safari refers to trips to observe the stunning African wildlife, especially those living in the savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to be more closely related to cars, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "nature walking safari", or "walking") is a walk of a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the cancellation announcement, you may be faced with a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies change, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies will not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
The vast majority of event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with average prices around ¥7,000.
Most hotels have an iron and ironing table that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If you don't like to wear socks or ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Do not allow the fabric to overheat (this can cause it to pull or even burn in extreme cases).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others, it takes several minutes for the water to boil.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you're worried about that, you should consider buying your water from a well-known brand in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter insects unfamiliar to them from their own region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infection.
Dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by means of contagious diseases themselves or by force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy duty-free products in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries may save money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, sometimes considerably.
The land between Point Marlon and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often through remote, backward areas.
If you are new to driving in the countryside, be aware that steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp corners await you.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than the preceding and following sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/s)  and a strict adherence to them is more important than the axis.
It's funny, but the cell phone signal is stronger here than in other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is as rich and varied as in its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastry is common with apples cooked all year round and with cherries and plums showing themselves in summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, nuts and other tree nuts. The much sought-after cakes generally make a particularly good pairing with a cup of unsweetened plain coffee.
If you want small but rich pasta jobs, try what's called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on which region you're in.
Curry is a dish that includes meat or vegetables, as well as dried herbs and spices.
Curry can be called "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, curries are made mostly with yogurt; in southern India and some other coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
When referring to Indonesia, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers the various regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without another qualifier, the term is used for food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Cava cuisine, which is now commonly found on the islands, features a number of basic, seasoned dishes. The main spices important to Cava are groundnut, bitter pepper, sugar (especially Cava coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The surface is the supports for the rider's legs, which swing from either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but there may be safety issues due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off a horse and a leg gets caught in the bridle and the horse runs away, the rider may be dragged.

Skiing and backpacking: This activity is also called skiing, skiing tour or skiing in the countryside.
It is similar to, but often slightly different from, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, which is a sport performed on steep terrain and requires much harder skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as a walking route.
If conditions are good, you'll be able to cover a lot more distance than you would on foot, but without well-maintained tracks and a heavy backpack, you'll rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, travelling to more than one country means going through many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, in this sense, is more or less a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition of which manufactured items are antiques, although some tax authorities define goods as antiques when they are over 100 years old.
The definition of antique varies by geography, as the age limit may be shorter in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be classified as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is important for many in other professions as well.

A course normally lasts two to five days and includes acting, quite a lot of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about trying to survive in the wild are common, but there are few publications about overcoming war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents with them on the way home.
Each government is willing to issue gender-non-specific (X) passports or renewed documents to conform to the desired name and gender.
The interest shown by foreign governments in these documents varies widely.
And the searches at security checkpoints became much more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Trans people before surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners with their privacy and reputation intact.
Rip currents are often the returning flow from waves breaking on a reef or similarly to the shore.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in several deep sections, where a fast current into deep water can occur.
Most deaths are the result of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible, due to fatigue.
The difficulty of swimming backwards is no different from normal as soon as you get out of the current.
Try to aim for a spot where you won't be caught again, or you might prefer to wait for help, depending on your skill or if you've been missed.

When you return home after living abroad, you've adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first go abroad, people are probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate the need to be patient and understanding of returning travelers.
The pyramid light and sound show is one of the most interesting things for kids in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them in silence before the show begins.
You hear the voices of tourists and vendors all the time, and the story of the voice and the light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Different countries have claimed rights to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and the islands have the most bases, with sixteen active bases as of 2020.

Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano has created a magnificent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is in the area surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea in the southern part of the peninsula.
The Peninsula mountains here merge with the plateau, then rise again to form the 360 km Ellsworth Ranges, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.

In remote areas where cell phone coverage is not available, a satellite phone may be your only option.
The satellite phone is not often a substitute for the cell phone, as you have to be in the open air to make a phone call, and you have to be able to see the satellite.
This service is frequently used by cruise ships and transport vessels, including explorers with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.

Finland is a great boating destination, and the "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands, mostly in lakes and coastal islands.
Not without a yacht in the archipelago and on the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a boat offer a different experience.
Boating is a traditional pastime in Finland, where one boat falls for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's quite unique except for the fact that in the Netherlands, for example, the number is forty-one.
Most of the original Baltic cruises included a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can sleep on the ship at night and tour the historic city for days.
From 2009, if you only go ashore by boat, you won't need a visa.
Some cruise brochures also list Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and travel to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and cultures, especially for those who have never flown before or have experienced a trauma related to flying.
And that's no shame: it's no different from the personal fears and other things that many people have that they don't like.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help to overcome a fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Large payments are made to courier companies to deliver goods quickly, often when commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs are needed.
Some routes have their own planes from the big companies, but other routes and the smaller companies have had problems.
If they sent the goods by air freight, it could have taken days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a hefty sum for privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
But it's not economical, and you can pay up to four times the normal price for business class and up to eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in even asking for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines realize that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a fortune for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The country's native language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, heavily affected by ethnic strife.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transdniester in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of the political talks, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been reestablished.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.

The hard exterior of the Parisians will quickly fade once you've demonstrated some basic subtlety.
The Plitvice Lakes national park is a densely forested area, mostly filled with pine, maple and cypress trees, and reflects a combination of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Microclimate diversity has a fairly wide plant diversity due to different soils and varying elevation levels.

Many more common species can be found here, as well as rare fauna such as the European badger, wolf, eagle, owl, falcon, wildcat, and bushbuck.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries offer a veil for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it's brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.

There are, of course, explanations for this tradition in Christianity, but it's possible that it was a pre-Christian ritual symbolizing spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold the Saturday night Easter Vigil during the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin midnight celebrations to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the first animals to arrive on the islands came here by swimming, flying or gliding.
The distance to the mainland prevented the mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of the first humans on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica during the winter months, you experience the polar night, which means that the sun never rises above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost every hour.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The standard work attire is a suit, and co-workers call each other by their last name or job title.
It's more important to have a workplace consensus that underlines the group effort rather than celebrating individual accomplishments.
Workers must often seek the approval of their superiors for any decisions they make, and are expected to obey their superiors' orders without question.
