Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about looking like puppets
Some members of the Assembly disagree with the proposal that the name should be changed to UPM (member of the Welsh Parliament).
The issue arose as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The name of the member of the Assembly is threatened by ridicule across the political spectrum.
One assembly member said he was disturbed by the fact that a Labour group was sleeping with the words ol Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: twp   genus and pwp   mode in Welsh.
A member of the Welsh Party assembly suggested alternatives, saying the group was largely "not happy".
The Welsh Conservative noted that the group was open to a change of name, but that there was little difference in pronunciation between the syllable MWP and Muppet.
The pronunciation of the Welsh letter w in this text is similar to the pronunciation of the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a bill to present the name changes, said: The final decision on any specifications regarding how the members of the Assembly are to be named, of course, is made by the members themselves.
According to the Act of the Welsh Government of 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public council on proposals that had received a large support for the Assembly to be called the Parliament of Wales.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Members of Parliament or WMP, but the majority supported the version WMP during the public meeting.
Members of the Assembly, of course, propose alternatives, but the struggle of Commission President Elaine Jones, who is expected to present a bill on changes within a few weeks, to get to the table may cause some difficulties.
The bill on reforms includes other changes to the working method of the Assembly, as well as the rules for disqualification of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
After discussing the bill, the members of the Assembly vote on the final name.
Macedonians to vote on renaming of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A referendum was held to resolve the longstanding dispute with neighboring Greece over the province of Macedonia.
Athens has long been a symbol of its northern neighbourhood and has repeatedly opposed membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Georgy Ivanov, declared that he ignored the results of the vote against the plebiscite on the change of name.
Referendum officials and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev stated that the change of name  is only the cost of membership of the EU and NATO.
When the churches in Harlem are fighting each other, the falling bells of St. Martin are silent.
The old people I spoke to said that I used to go to every corner and have a church,  said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither of them are present.
He said that the loss of all possessions is understandable.
Today people interact differently,  he said.
Bars  these are not neighborhood living rooms that people frequent.
As for churches, he's afraid that the money from the sale of assets will go on for a long time, and sooner or later, they'll be back to their original place, as leaders expect".
The churches can be moved to multi-apartment houses with condominiums, where people who don't help those who are left in the temple area, can live.
Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white people,  he said,  so these churches are speeding up the closing period, so it's doubtful that most of the people who move into these condominiums will be members of those churches.
Both churches were built by the city of Harlem decades later, by white congregations before the Metropolitan Society of St. Martin became the black metropolis in 1870.
The first white Methodist congregation moved in 1930.
The black congregation who worshiped nearby owned the building.
The building of St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by St. John Howard, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main street of Harlem, opposed to hiring or promoting black people.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but church members who came to Father Johnson devised a plan to restore the building and ordered the carillon to be taken.
St. David Johnson, the son and heir of Father Johnson at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
In July, an expert who played the carillon called it differently: cultural treasure and untraditional historical instrument.
Also, Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, said that she was the first black musician in the world to play Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marrieuzer said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
The events in St. Martin's Church in the last few months were a series of hard conversations between architects and contractors, half of whom were white supremacists, and the rest were drawn by the episcopal mausoleum.
The institute, which is composed of the heads of the Mahallah, was informed by the Church Council in July in writing that it would try to hand over the exhibits to the Mahallah Church Council and that the Church Council was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the Mahallah.
Some church members complained that the Mahalla was not transparent enough.
A 13-year-old shark is injured while hunting a dolphin in California
In California, a 13-year-old boy who was diving into a shark hunt on Saturday, the opening day of the season, was attacked and wounded by a shark, officials said.
The attack occurred at about 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drowning his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, and that he saw a boy crying for help, and that a group of people had rescued him.
And Hamel said, It was the result of the worm, but afterwards he bit me.
She said she knew that she was screaming and had bitten my teeth.
And Hammel said to him, The whole wall of his mouth is torn open.
And I called out to them all, and said, Come forth out of the water; and Hamel said, There is a shark in the water.
The child was airlifted to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was assessed as serious.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The captain of the rescue service, Larry Giles, told a press conference that a few weeks ago, a shark was spotted in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles said the victim's upper chest was injured.
Officials have closed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Esinitas for 48 hours in order to conduct investigative work and ensure security.
Giles said there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, and most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK luxury market.
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams through its beauty department stores with sales advisors.
As sales of artistic clothing and household goods declined, a substantial development in the UK luxury market, which is valued at £2.8 billion, led to the testing of large fashion salons across 11 stores across the country, which, if successful, would be sent to mass stores next year.
Supermarkets are developing a trendy investment in the way they used to use shelves where TVs, shortwave ovens and household appliances once stood.
Sainsbury's is doubling the size of its fashion offer for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, to 3,000 products.
Also, existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will have additional space with firm areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also currently re-launching its Boutique cosmetics range to provide more products aimed at vegetarian orientation, which is popular among young buyers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test the perfume retail concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in the Croydon area of south London, and the second in the Selley-Oak area of Birmingham later this year.
Moving to online stores and nearby shops to buy small amounts of food every day means that we have to do more to invite people to supermarkets.
Michael Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, says that retail stores are more like universal stores because the supermarket chain is trying to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts through a large number of services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos stores in hundreds of locations, including several Habitats stores after acquiring the Habitats network two years ago, which he says has increased food sales and increased purchasing efficiency.
The supermarket's efforts to restructure its cosmetic and pharmacy units have failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the dispute over the distribution of profits from its pharmacy stores in its supermarkets led to a dispute.
A new strategy emerged three years ago when Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy Network, for £125 million.
It is said that Lloyds will play a key role in this plan by adding a wider range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said, "We've changed the look of our fashion houses to better serve our customers.
We also invested in specialised professionals who will always advise you.
Our brand range means that we are designed to satisfy any taste, and an attractive environment and convenient location makes us an attractive place for beauty that stands in the way of old fashioned shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby refuses to accept an £11m deal
After TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled her 11 million dollar deal with her lifestyle brand to accumulate her new deal with Mark and Spencer and ITV, Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, became angry.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of clothing and accessories.
The couple's business was associated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old TV host posted on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby, to give more weight to her big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV, the star of Dragons Den, gave up the successful business of the lifestyle brand Peter Jones at the last minute, putting her in a difficult position.
Jones said he was angry when the media acknowledged that the Golden Daughter of the channel had agreed to a new £1.5 million deal at a dispute at its head office in the Marlow district of Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, meaning they had no time to advertise their clothing and Truly accessories brand.
This business was linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and could have doubled Willowby's fortune of £11 million.
When Willowby was 37, and he went on Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the United Kingdom and headed to one of his vacation homes.
What the media said:  Truly was not really Holly's idea.
This was supposed to be the long-term future he would see decades later.
His decision to withdraw from the game put all the participants in a difficult situation.
No one could believe what had happened on the third day, because it was already near to start.
The main office in Marlow district has a store full of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the departure of the driver of This Morning, one of the UK's highest paid stars, could cost the firm millions of dollars, from the huge contribution to the products ranging from lights and lamps to clothing and homewares and the possible delay in its launch.
It can also mean that a long-term friendship has come to an end.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Johnson and his wife, Tara Cap, for 10 years.
Willowby co-founded Truly in 2016 with Cap, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend their holidays together and own 40 percent of the television firm of Jones Baldwin.
Willowby is preparing to become an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin, the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a person who was close to Jones said, "We don't comment on the farmers' business".
We talked for a long time and then we fell in love
He was also vocal about the opinions that some consider to be "unpresidential" and the media criticism he received for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why was President Trump so quickly turned down?
Trump said in a funny voice of the new driver:
I never gave up.
Trump noted that he had plans for a next meeting after his first meeting with Kim in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization were in full swing.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean senior diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that he did not see a proper response to the US's first step towards disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, the US warned that it was continuing to impose sanctions aimed at pressure.
Trump was optimistic in his statement.
We have excellent relations with North Korea, he said.
We are committed to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have such a wonderful relationship now.
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of prisoners and the return of remaining American military personnel to their homes.
She also defended her unique ways of talking about her relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of the 10,000 people out there who want to come to this crowded, crowded square, we're going to have 200 people living right there", Trump told a crowd in front of him.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and an earthquake have claimed hundreds of lives and devastated the island.
He said that after the earthquake in Lomboka, for example, foreign NGOs do not need help.
Although 10 percent of the population of Lomboka had to evacuate, the disaster on a national scale, the international aid agreement, was not announced.
Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they did not ask for international assistance, so there are some problems here,  said Ms. Sambung.
The children's rescue group is currently assembling a team to Pallas, but it is not yet known if foreign workers will be able to work on the ground.
A spokesman for the National Emergency Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian government is evaluating the situation in Palau to determine whether international agencies can be given assistance.
Given the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country is not yet ready for the opening of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Acheche, other coastlines were not accessible.
While the warning of the deaths was real, it is possible that Palau did not have a simple siren to warn of the coming tsunami.
As the situation became calm, travel between the Indonesian islands became increasingly difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
To help the victims of the earthquake, a hospital ship stationed in Lombok is now heading to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has put improving Indonesia's broken infrastructure as a key focus of his campaign and has invested in motor vehicles and railways.
But Mr. Joko ran for office the following year, and his administration ran into financial problems.
Mr. Joko was also under pressure from the interfaith conflicts in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim community have chosen a conservative form of religion.
When Christians and Muslims used machetes, arrows and arrows, as well as other cold weapons, more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge scores a goal from the middle of the field against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge scored a goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London in the 89th minute to save Premier League side Liverpool from Chelsea.
When his team was down 1-0, Starridge stood about 30 metres from Chelsea's gate and passed Gerdan Shakiri.
He hit the ball with his left foot.
And the ball went upward from the place of the charge, and toward the upper right hand of the gate.
Finally he jumped over Arrisbalaga and entered the gate.
It was just an attempt to get into the right position and take the ball away, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as they can, so I tried to give myself enough time,  says Starridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
And I saw him coming near, and I smote him with a stroke; and I did not think of him, but smote him.
In the first half, Chelsea took a 1-0 lead and scored a point thanks to the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this game, the blue-coat forward gave a pass to Mateo Kovacic, who went around the middle of the field and entered the Liverpool field.
In the middle of the field, Kovacic passed the obstacle quickly.
And he let Hazarad go through the court, and he gave the ball to him.
Hazard went around the defense and struck the back of the column with his left foot, which went around Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 15:00 in the group stage of the Champions League.
Chelsea will meet in London at 15:00 on Thursday with the video-ton at the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
On Sunday morning, the country's emergency agency reported that 832 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, told a press conference that many people were left under the ruins of buildings that were damaged by a wave of about 20 feet (6 meters) in height due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday.
The city of Pallu, with a population of more than 380,000, was devastated.
After a woman was killed by a cold weapon, police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The investigation into the murder began this morning after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Mirseyside district.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with a knife wound at Tracey Mews and John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to contact them.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The strike is now underway, and we ask everyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious near John Street in the Birkenhead area to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers who may have something on their video recorders, to contact us, because you may have the information we need to investigate.
The police representative said that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead district and was found in her home.
And it came to pass that day, in the afternoon, that the men who had known her came to the place where she was, to inquire of the place where she was today.
The investigation is ongoing because the police said they were reporting to the relatives of the victim.
Grayson, a taxi driver in the Mews neighborhood, wanted to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to leave or enter the building.
When he learned about the situation, he didn't know what to say.
Residents were told that they would be allowed to enter the house after a few hours.
One policeman was heard telling a woman that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
And she brought the crime to the place where it was committed.
He repeats, "It's a shame".
At about 2 p.m., two police buses appeared outside the enclosed area, and another bus.
Within the enclosure, several police officers were guarding the high-rise building.
The information is requested to be written to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or call 247 on 0800 555 111 on 30 September.
The parliamentary monument of Kromvel remains the last monument to have influenced the process of rewriting history
Breaking it would be a fitting punishment for the Taliban-like acts of destruction committed by its fanatical Puritan supporters against many of England's cultural and religious values.
However, Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's proposal stupid and historical rewrite.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The debate over the demolition of the monument was about the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
The struggle against the icon in the English Civil War was neither organized nor carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell seems to have been unjustly punished for his grandfather Thomas' actions in the last century.
Sir William Hameau Thornecroft's wonderful description of Cromwell is a reflection of 19th-century thought and part of a historical figure that most people believe deserves praise.
Mr Goldsmith said in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph: "Perhaps, more than now, at the end of the 19th century, people thought that Cromwell was a protector of the parliament from external pressure, in turn, from the monarchy.
It is not clear how true this is, but it is a controversial situation among historians.
This conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the basis of the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell was a well-known figure who was one of the parties at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be praised and remembered.
Chinese farmer killed by a pig
According to local media sources, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeastern China.
According to the South China Morning Post, a man named Yuan was found dead at a market in the city of Lupanshū, Guangzhou, near a pig farm on Sunday, with a blood clot and a spinal cord injury.
In the city of Sinin, Qinghai province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in his pigsty.
According to reports, he came to the market with his share of 15 pigs from the neighboring Yunnan province.
The next morning his attendants found him dead and found the piggy door open.
He said that the pigsty had a large roof covered in blood.
According to reports, a court investigation has proven that the 550-pound (249 kg) tall tall tall farmer was attacked to death.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, a part of the body called Vu, who was bleeding from the legs of the deceased, said, "I am a man who is suffering from a stroke".
The video cameras show Yuan entering the market around 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, her body was found.
And the beast that slew the man was not of the Yuan, nor was it of his portion.
The head of the market told The Evening News that while the police were gathering evidence at the scene of the crime, the pig was detained elsewhere to prevent another attack.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market leadership are agreeing on compensation for his death.
This was a rare occurrence, but it was not uncommon for pigs to attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, severely injuring a man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer weighing 650 pounds (294 kg) was squeezed into a tractor and chased away by the farmer's wife.
In 2012, after an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not poisonous, but they can be affected by the smell of blood as a "sweetener".
They just play.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them, he said.
The end of the storm Rosa will bring large-scale, heavy rainfall to the southeast of the United States
According to weather forecasts, the storm Rosa will weaken as it passes through the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the near future, the storm Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday, at about 5 a.m. eastern time, the storm reached a Category 1 hurricane of 85 mph (137 km/h), and it was located 385 miles (619 km) southwest of the Mexican island of Punta Eugenia.
On Sunday, the storm is expected to move northward.
At this point, a line of lower atmospheric pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward along the west coast of the United States. When Storm Rosa reached the bottom of Lower California as a tropical storm on Monday, it began to move the extreme tropical moisture northward toward the southeastern region of the United States.
Typhoon Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture reacts with the approaching lower line of atmospheric pressure, causing large-scale southwestern rainfall in the near future.
In some areas, 1-4 inches of rainfall may cause flooding, flooding and drought in deserts.
Heavy tropical humidity causes rainfall of 2-3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the Southeast, especially in the Arizona metropolitan area, rainfall of up to 2 to 4 inches is expected.
In response to rapidly changing conditions caused by widespread tropical rainfall, there may be unexpected flooding.
When the storm is coming, go not on foot into the wilderness.
A rainfall can turn the rocks into a dry river, and lightning can cause winds and dust to blow into some areas.
The approaching lowering of the atmospheric pressure line will cause heavy rainfall in parts of the coastline of southern California.
Rainfall of more than half an inch in total can cause flooding and road disruption.
This is the first rainy season in the region.
Some tropical rainfall approaches Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, and the rainfall reaches a larger extent late on Monday and Tuesday.
On the first day of the week, the rain continued to rain until the third day.
With the Arctic cooling in October, temperatures across the United States could change dramatically, but the tropics will remain warm.
Sometimes, it causes a sharp change in temperature in nearby areas.
One of the most dramatic changes in temperature on Sunday was in the central region of the United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, are about 20 degrees.
The summer heat will return in the coming days and expand its range.
In early October, warm weather is expected in the central and eastern regions of the United States, with temperatures of about 80 degrees Celsius expected to extend from the Southern Plains to the northeastern region.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York City could rise to 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above normal.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts a higher-than-average temperature for the eastern region of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavano
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched a seductive testimony on six television channels by Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh and Christine Blazy Ford, who accused her of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
At this point, when the broadcasters broke the regular distribution network at the last minute of Friday's incident, political turmoil erupted: an agreement for the FBI to conduct a weekly impeachment investigation was signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% confident that he had held her drunk at a Kavanaugh University Healthcare Supper and had attempted to undress her.
Kavanaugh stood up and swore he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen said it could be seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox news channels and MSNBC.
Other networks, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, that showed it, were not available at the time.
Nielsen, on the other hand, is usually a little bit crazy about counting people in offices.
In this sense, the number of spectators is equal to the number of people who gather for a football match or an Oscar.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel's hosts actively supported Kavanaugh's appointment and overtook all networks with an average viewership of 5.69 million during the daytime broadcast.
ABC was the second channel with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After listening, there was a high level of interest.
Flake was the main character in the Friday drama.
When interest waned, the Republican Party office made a statement about its intention to vote for Kavanaugh, which was captured on CNN and CBS cameras when he entered the elevator on Friday morning as he was heading to the Law Committee.
CNN was broadcasting live that he was staring down for several minutes after hearing the curse.
And a woman said unto him, Behold, I stand before thee.
Do you think he speaks the truth to the land?
And he said unto her, Thou hast given me power over all the women that were sick.
Flake said his office had made a statement and had a few words to say at the committee hearing before the elevator door was closed.
Broadcast and cable networks broadcast live broadcast hours later when the Law Committee was about to vote to cast Kavanaugh's candidacy for the full Senate vote.
However, I did so because I realized that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would begin investigating charges against the Democratic Party's minority-supported candidate next week.
Flake was partially persuaded by a friend of his, Senator Chris Koon of the Democratic Party.
After a few conversations with some senators, Flake came to a decision.
Flake's decision was influential because it was clear that Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has called on the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May condemned critics for playing political games on Britain ' s exit from the European Union
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing political games with the UK's vision and undermining the reputation of national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with his photo on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that his plans to withdraw from the EU were not in line with the UK's plans to impose tariffs on each other.
Wade Simpson shot: Police arrested Dayton Simpson suspected of killing the LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and sent to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Official sources released a video of the rift between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his eyelids during the summit.
According to the WAFB, the police found a mirror at the scene and said that it contained Simpson's DNA.
After Simpson was questioned, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade.
The defendant said that he was given a $350,000 bail.
East Baton Rouge Regional Investigator released the first report Friday, which reported that the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head, or neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Department for its efforts to track down the fugitive, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their assistance in his search and arrest.
Joe Alleva, head of the sports faculty of LSU, thanked law enforcement for their hard work and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward Baton Rouge grew up, and his father also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was spirited and that he had forgotten about Wade's death.
You're always getting so caught up in this stuff", Wade said.
The Lake of Fire Covers Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatepetel fires reached the southern tip of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the crater after the fire broke out on Saturday, with 183 gas and ash shots recorded within 24 hours.
The center saw many flowers and damsels.
Video posted on social media shows that in areas such as SochiMillo, Mexico City, a thin layer of ash has covered the windshields of cars.
Geophysicists have observed that the activity of the fires, located 45 miles (72 km) from the capital, began to wane after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The brand is active since 1994 under the name Don Goyo.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after a clash between pro-independence protesters and a special police force on Saturday, and thousands marched on the first anniversary of the referendum on the partition of Catalonia.
As soon as the police began to retreat, a group of masked separatists threw eggs at the police, sprayed powdered paint, and plunged into thick fog the streets usually crowded with tourists.
Later that day, the police used their rifles to suppress the clash and began a red line.
For several hours, pro-independence groups who chanted "We will not forgive, we will not forgive" met face to face with trade union marchers who shouted "Spain is long".
According to local media, 14 people who suffered minor injuries were treated during the protest.
Madrid declared it illegal, and a year after the referendum on October 1, which celebrated the victory of Catalan separatists, the region declared independence was still unstable.
Voters reached a majority for independence, but the majority of those opposed to the split boycotted the vote, so the number of voters was low.
According to the Catalan government, last year, police clashed with local elections in the area, injuring about 1,000 people.
Independence groups have been in the field since Friday to avoid a parade of supporting the state police.
Although the march was going on, it seems to have been forced to move in a different direction.
Narcisse Termez, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in the march of the separatists alongside his wife, who told me that I had lost my last hope that Catalonia would achieve independence.
We have experienced the most wonderful moments of our lives.
My parents, who had the right to vote, had tears in their eyes and now they are sick, she said.
Despite winning the much-awaited regional vote in December last year, Catalan independence parties have tried to maintain the situation this year thanks to their prominent leaders who have been subjected to voluntary persecution for their actions in organizing the referendum, finally declaring independence, or are in prison awaiting a court decision.
Joanne Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the march on her phone as a support to the police, politicians who were escalating the conflict on both sides.
He said, "The situation is getting worse.
Orioles Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison for years, announced that he will contest elections to the European Parliament on Saturday.
My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to express the decline of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government, he said.
London: Men who hit houses with vehicles arrested
In London, 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested for driving into a house several times.
The incident occurred in a half-hour-old building in Ballinagard on Thursday at about 19:30 British Summer Time.
The detention inspector Bob Blemming's report said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
Maybe he was hit by a car at some point.
Menga's knockout goal left Rangers behind and led to a 1-0 win over Livingston
Dolly Menga ' s first goal confirms the win for Livingston
Livingston's first-choice manager, Steven Gerrard, was appointed manager of the Aybrokes, but he led the Rangers to a second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly was notable for her attack on Menga, which was a surprise when Gary Holt's team compared the score to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win an off-field match in the Premier League this season, where he faced outgoing Harts the following Sunday, finishing 8 points behind.
The Rangers had previously met Rapid of Vienna on Thursday at their home ground in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston maintained his best record in the league for six games, while Kenny Miller had a bitter taste of defeat with head coach Holt, who took over last month.
Livingston has opened up its opportunities to the public
Holt's team was in a position to push Rangers up a straight line and keep a little ahead of the goal.
Scott Robinson made his way up the ladder, but he was in the game on goal, and then Alan Litgau tried his best to catch the goalkeeper who hit Craig Halkett with his head.
The organizers were happy to see the Rangers play as they knew that the host team would be able to catch up with the game.
And it was a decisive goal with a perfectly similar pitch.
Rangers sent the charge, and when Livingston reached the goal line, Declan Gallagher and Robinson approached Menaghan to score, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the charge.
At that point, the Rangers were in the lead, but they couldn't get past the strong goalkeeper's defense and they didn't hit the goalie's Liam Kelly.
This situation persisted until the second half, but Alfredo Morelos took the hit that goalkeeper Kelly had enjoyed.
Scott Pittman was knocked out by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, while Litgow returned the score in another standard way by Livingston.
Livingston's offensive field was repeatedly crossed and celebrated as often, but two offensive blows were given - one for the opposition of Halkett Glenn Middleton to replace him, and the other for hitting the ball with his hands.
Livingston left a comment on the analysis
BBC Scotland commentator Alasder Lamont from the Tony Macaroni Arena
A surprising game and result for Livingston.
And it came to pass, when they came up, that they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up, and they came up to them, and they came up to them, and they said,
Their playing style and composition have remained unchanged since their return to the top level, but they have been owned by Holt, who has worked hard and dedicated himself to the team since the award.
And you can't count the number of heroes he has.
Captain Halckett organized a spectacular attack, and the game was unprecedented, while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a complete shock from start to finish.
Ranger's inspiration was lost.
It was a little bit of a shock in Gerrard's day, and it seems to have fallen below that level.
They dropped the final ball, and the next time they came into a clash with the owners, which was to slow the Rangers down, but they were out of the middle of the tournament table.
Erdogan was welcomed in Köln
The leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September) and the sky was open and warm.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's famous visit to Germany, which aims to renew relations with NATO partners.
They had a dispute with them on human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After this, Erdogan took the new mosque and went to Cologne.
The city was the most populous city outside Turkey.
Police set up a fence to prevent 25,000 crowds from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters began to gather nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Kurdish opponents of Erdogan protested against Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to oppose him.
It seems that the two sides were divided by the guest whom some German Turks saw as the prime minister and others as the supreme.
Motorcycle accident in Deptford: road traffic accident

Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the blast
The prison administration said that six prison officers were injured in the riots in the men's prison.
The riot began at the Long Lartin prison of the great lord of Worcestershire on Sunday at about 09:30 British Summer Time and has not been published since.
To quell the riots that had started, eight prisoners were called in by special Tornado officers, who locked them in one wing of the prison.
Officers who suffered minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison service official reported that prison staff who had undergone special training were mobilized to suppress the riots in the Long Lartin prison of his great-grandfather.
Six injured personnel were treated.
We do not allow the irregularities in our institutions, we hope that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will remain in prison for a long time.
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison chief was reportedly being treated in hospital for the attack.
In October last year, a special police force was called to the prison to suppress a massive riot in which prison staff were being shot with billiards stones.
Rosa Falls threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (possible to have a positive effect on areas affected by drought)
You'd think Arizona was hit by a tropical depression, but this is exactly how it's going to start next week, when the forces of Rosa Falls will hit the desert region of the southwest, causing flooding.
State Meteorological Services has already activated anti-flood monitoring on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the rain on Monday evening and head for Phoenix on Tuesday.
The state meteorological service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have been in the tropical storm or depression state for 200 miles (321 km) in Phoenix.
Katrina (1967) is a waterfall in Arizona, 40 miles (64 km) from the border.
The State Flood Reporting Center predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with a rainfall of 6 inches each in the Mogollon, Arizona, order.
In other parts of the southwestern United States, particularly the central lowland mountains and the Great Basin Mountains, it can go from 1 to 2 inches, to 4 inches each.
And the flood of the land of the Rose shall be called a gift of nature, because the land shall not be exposed to the drought.
The flood risk is high, but the lack of rain is also positive, because the southwestern region is currently suffering from drought.
According to the US drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is affected by the second highest category of extreme drought, reports weather.com.
In its direction, the Rose Falls first covered the lower California floor of Mexico.
While not losing her strength, Rosa passed the Mexican city of Punta Eugenia at 385 miles (619 km) on Sunday morning with strong winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) and headed north at a speed of 12 mph (19 km/h).
When a storm comes upon the cold waters of the Red Sea, his strength is weak.
It is expected to hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday night or late in the evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe, and therefore flooding is a risk.
Falling rainfall of 36 inches, even 10 inches, will cover the area from lower California to northwestern Sonora, according to weather.com.
After that, the tropical storm Rosa will cover northern Mexico, reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, and then passing through Arizona to southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
The main threat from the Rose or its trail is the rainfall in lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert", the National Falls Information Center said.
These rains are predicted to cause life-threatening floods and floods in the desert and migration in the mountainous regions.
Northon attack: Four people arrested for murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old man was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found at the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Sunday, around 04:00 British Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital, and his health is stable.
Police in Somerset said that two boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the area of Radstock in Avon at night.
If the incident was recorded on their mobile phone, the officers asked them to contact them.
Trump said Kavano was hurt by the betrayal and anger of the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavano  A blow to the Democratic Party's ruthless and brutal tactics ", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
In his candidacy, Kavanaugh said Trump was hurt by the betrayal and anger of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Christine Blassy Ford testified before Congress, openly and forcefully denying that she had raped herself as a teenager decades ago.
Ford also responded during the indictment hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's wit, character and courage.
 Know that voting for Judge Kavanaugh is supporting the most qualified legal expert of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service", he said in front of West Virginia supporters.
The President described the importance of Republican activity in the midterm elections and indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's candidacy.
 Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm in a hurry".
That's why I fight for good candidates everywhere.
Trump said Democrats are on a path to "resistance and disruption".
The first main procedural vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to be held in the Senate meeting on Friday, the senior assistant of the head of the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds of people died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number of casualties is increasing
At least 384 people were killed and many people flooded when massive waves hit beaches as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
When the waves, up to six meters high, hit the shore, hundreds of people gathered on the beach at Palau on Friday to celebrate, many people died and all those on the way to the waves were destroyed.
The tsunami was 7.5 points after the earthquake.
People were still on the beach at the time of the tsunami threat and were not immediately evacuated or killed,  said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's Natural Disaster Response Agency (BNPB) at a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come with itself, it carried away cars, ships, houses and hit all on land,  said Nugroho and added that the tsunami moved at 497 mph (800 km/h) in the open sea before hitting the coastline.
And he said, Some of them climbed up to the trees, and they lived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs taken by the Agency for Disaster Management showed numerous buildings and shops collapsing, bridges being swept away and damaged, and the mosque surrounded by water.
On the Sabbath the earthquake caused the city to see the earthquake.
The earthquake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city at the end of a long, shallow bay may have increased the size of the tsunami, the report said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the ruins of buildings and 540 people were injured and 29 people were left unknown.
The area known as Donggala, located along the coastline 190 miles (300 km) north of Palau, nearest the epicenter of the earthquake, is likely to have more casualties and damage, said Nugroho.
According to Nugroho, communication with Donggala was completely disrupted and there was no information.
The Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people live there and that the organization's staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse,  the message said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami to Palau, but the authorities said the waves came when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, you can hear a man standing on the top floor of the building yelling at people on the lower street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water walls would fall to the shore, draining buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a general power outage around the city of Palo, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The troops have started sending aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still need food and other basic items.
The city airport is open for assistance only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in the city of Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia was over 800.
This is bad.
According to Mr. Doseba, World Vision employees arrived safely in Palo, where they were living in the brass shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, where they witnessed the destruction on the way.
And he said, They have seen many ruins of houses.
This is bad.
Although relief groups have initiated a series of actions to activate disaster relief mechanisms, some have complained about the barrier to travel to the city of Palau for experienced foreign relief workers.
According to Indonesian rules, the initiation of foreign financing, material resources and staffing is only allowed if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial disaster,  said the Indonesian Red Cross representative, Auliya Arriani.
 If the government confirms that this is a national disaster, we can allow international assistance, but there is no such status yet.
Although it was the second night in Palau after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the unknowns are hoping to return with the hope of erasing the vicious images of natural disasters from their loved ones.
On Saturday, the little boy was removed from the sewer system.
And it came to pass on the first day of the week that the men of the city brought forth a woman who had been crushed two days with her mother, under the she-camel.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team in paragliding, congratulated two of the missing paragliders who participated in the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Roa Roa was accompanied by other people who were staying at the hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, who was his disciple.
I was a paraplanetarian, so I had a personal emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Gendon said that after the news spread among the paraplanetists about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he sent WhatsApp messages to the party at the beach in Palo.
And when he sent, behold, there was but one gray bird, and there was not one of the two blue ones.
And I think that means that the messages are not sent.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport , Libya
A press release from the Newport Police Department reported that thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was filling an ATM in Newport, Liwi, early Friday morning.
In the statement, Detective Dennis McCarty wrote that the driver of the vehicle was preparing to deposit additional money by releasing the ATM from the entertainment complex.
While his hand was still unlocked, another man ran after the employee of Brink and stole a bag of money for construction.
According to the report, witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about them should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: Officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has held the nickname Ye for some time, and he used that nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change came on the eve of her participation in the TV show Saturday Night Live, which is expected to release her new album called Yandhi.
According to the show's producer, she will replace Ariana Grande, who has refused to participate in the show for emotional reasons.
In addition to being a shortened form of his current professional name, West had also said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
I think y  is the most common word in the Bible and in the Bible it means less, West said earlier this year when Big Boy was announcing the title of his album.
So I am you, I am us, he is us.
It came out of Kanye, and it represents one thing, just the Y of our good, our bad, our bad, everything.
Album  is often a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the few popular rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs was known by different names, such as Puff Daddy, Pi DiDdy or Diddy, but this year he chose the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, Jay Zee, also used his name with or without a capital letter.
Mexican President AMLO has promised not to use military force against the people
As the elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody punishments of students in the country, he pledges never to use military force against the common people.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at the Plaza de Tlatelolco that he would never use military force to stop the people of Mexico.
During the beginning of the left-wing student movement in all of Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful march on the square, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly aid to students and opening additional free state universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities will lead to the joining of young people in criminal groups.
US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Kai-Fu Li, an investor and artificial intelligence expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that China is increasing its involvement in artificial intelligence, and the US should double its research spending on this field.
While the explanations were not an official strategy for artificial intelligence in the United States at large, they came after some parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence.
China announced its plan last year: it will try to be the leader in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
Given that all other countries are far behind the US, it would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, and we expect the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence, Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will happen in the United States.
The superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order book published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Li  is the head of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++ which is one of the most popular companies in the field of artificial intelligence in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that won the American Best Otello Player award, and later he became managing director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee hosted leading U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next race would be to help identify the next visionaries.
Mr. Lee said that researchers in the United States have to work hard to win government grants.
The academic best is being taken away by corporations, not China,  said Li.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have attracted renowned scientists from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Mr. Lee said that making changes to immigration policy could improve the U.S. research on artificial intelligence.
I think that green cards should be automatically submitted to doctors of science in the field of artificial intelligence,  he said.
The State Council of China announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations have provided money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Center on Artificial Intelligence, which should be attended by partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it will invest $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation now spends more than $100 million annually on research in artificial intelligence.
The US legislation, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been unstable for months.
Macedonians vote on renaming of the country in a referendum
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia and this could lead to a solution to the long-running dispute with Greece, which has blocked its application to join the European Union and NATO.
The name of its neighbour in northern Greece, with a province called Macedonia, is to claim its territory, and the neighbour has vetoed its membership in NATO and the European Union.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the basis of a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change may violate the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgy Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about the minimum participation of 50 percent of voters needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum ballot was:  Do you support the agreement with Greece and NATO membership and the European Union?
Supporters of the change of name of the country, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider this to be the right decision for Macedonia, which was one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia to join the European Union and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, for their opportunity to live freely within the European Union, because it means a more dangerous life for all of us", said the 79-year-old Olga Georgievska, a resident of Skopje.
Although it does not have the force of law, a sufficient number of parliamentarians said they supported it to clarify the results of the vote.
To change the name, two thirds of the parliament must support it.
The State Election Commission said that there were no reports of violations of the rules until 1 pm.
However, the participation rate of 66 percent of registered voters was 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
"I came to vote for my children, we should be in Europe", said 62-year-old José Tanevski, a Skopje voter.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted in the city of Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, for a referendum on changing the name of the country in Macedonia, which would lead to NATO membership and European Union accession.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
We want to join NATO and the European Union, but we do not want to enter through the official gate,  said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have a good conscience.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and join the European-Asian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will bring the necessary investment for Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
I am sure that the majority will support me, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO ,  said Zaev after the vote.
He said that the result of the ya will be the confirmation of our future.
According to a poll published by the Institute of Political Research last Monday, 30-43% of voters will attend the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of them said they voted "yes".
For a referendum to be successful, it needs to have a turnout of 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the Western government that came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes the entire defense of the Brighton club and approaches the gate
In a 2-0 win against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly broke the Brighton's defense.
Aguero did it in the 65th minute, making it funny.
The Argentine striker took a pass in the middle of the field when the combination started.
He ran through three of the club's three defenders before moving to the open.
And Aguero stayed among the four players in blue robes.
He passed one defender, then a few more players on the edge of Brighton.
And then he passed to Sterling.
The English striker hit the ball first on the charge field and returned it to Aguero, who threw his right foot towards Brighton club goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, striking the right side of the net.
Aguero has some leg injuries, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
He scored a goal and we were on our way.
However, in the Premier League, the blue-collared players were given the upper hand by Sterling.
That goal was scored in 29 minutes.
In the same game, Aguero took the ball within the Brighton area.
He gave that bag to Leroy Sané for a beautiful pass.
Sane touched the ball several times before sending Sterling to the far column.
And the man in blue robes cast the net before he went out of the field.
On Tuesday evening at 12:55, he will play against Hofensheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Nekkar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play against Roquis as a point-taker
After the club was eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to speed up the next start.
However, always active, Sherzer hopes to give up the ball against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but still only if there are play-off results for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead from the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League's Western Division.
The Rockies won the wild card at least five times, but still managed to secure their first division title by defeating the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night.
We can play a simple song, but at least we can get started knowing that there will be an atmosphere here in Denver and the team that will play at the highest level this year.
Why don't I want to compete here?
Nationals will now announce the start for Sunday's game, but it seems that in this case it will give the ball to Scherzer.
Scherzer, who made his 34th start, trained on the pitcher's court on Thursday and gave the ball in his normal form on Sunday.
The right-hander of the Washington club has a record of 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts, with 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
When the President spoke about the importance of the Republican participation rate in the midterm elections, his election to the position of Supreme Court indirectly referred to the situation regarding Brett Kavanaugh.
All we do is be done in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the older ones, and I'm not just running, but I'm actually running, so I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this nasty group of radical Democrats, and you see this happening right now.
And they have taken every means to restore power to themselves, and ye see evil and abomination.
They don't care who they hurt or who they oppress in order to take power and control, and we don't give it to them.
He said the goal of the Democrats is to "show and hinder".
You've seen this in the last four days, he said, and he called the Democrats  angry, mean, unfavorable and hypocritical.
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, which denounced Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, and it was heard by the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you allow the document to spread?
No, no, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for someone  it was really bad sign language  it was the worst sign language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
He is reluctant to talk openly about his feelings
When activists from the Momentum movement in my local party voted to blame me, it was no surprise.
And finally, I am the last of the Labour Party MPs who don't support us, because we all have our own opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, had this attitude because she was firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the blame movement tested me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
There were similar issues about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, across Europe, that Jeremy didn't agree with his former leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Assembly report said that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, this was the case with the Friday evening meetings of the BK.
Unfortunately, today, this is not a fairy tale in many meetings and the promise of a more gentle, more gentle politics, if ever so common, has been forgotten.
It is becoming clearer that differences in opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed in terms of its suitability for the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, with my colleagues who previously thought our political views were similar, and expecting me to hold positions on national security or on an EU market that I never agreed with.
Every time I speak in public and whatever I say, there are words on social media that call for rejection of choice, for blaming the policies of the centre, for my absence from the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I've been more involved than some of my colleagues, because the opinions that are directed at me are usually political.
I appreciate the professionalism and enthusiasm of my colleagues who are victims of sexism or racism every day, but who don't hide it.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how the levels of violence have become normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needs to develop a culture of resilience.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different opinions and the party is being limited by changing the rules of disbelief or choice.
Over the last two years, I've been given a lot of advice to stay focused, to stay active, and then I'm told that I'm going to be okay.
But that's not why I came into politics.
It was the failure of the Thatcher government to leave my schoolroom in a completely ruined state that motivated me to support the highest level of public service for those who needed it most, whether as a local council member or government minister, since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East County could ever confuse my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
I can tell all those who support this movement that on Friday, when I go to Brexit, which is damaging to households, institutions and public services in our country, I don't understand the need to spend time and effort to be loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
My only speech is not to the Nottingham Momentum movement, but to my constituents, who have been or are not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that the possibility of refusing to approve me or any political efficiency or action that I consider to be best for you all will not prevent me from doing so.

Air 38  17 Melrose: Unbeaten Air is in first place
Two late attempts slightly spoiled the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr was well-deserved to win this very exciting Premier League match.
They are now in the tenth place, and they sit at the table.
In the end, their excellent defense, as well as their good use of the opportunity, won the field owners and coach Peter Mercy had every opportunity to be grateful.
Today we have passed through our games and we have not lost yet, so I should be happy, he said.
Robin Christie from the Melrose team said: "We should give the Air Club a fair price, they have used their opportunities better than we have.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute action by Fraser Clim led the Ayr Club to the front, but the yellow paper given to the Mellows for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was then sent off by the Warriors, allowed the score to be changed and Jason Baggott received an unenforced action.
Climone increased Ayr's lead through penalties, before, in the middle of the game, he scored points, then played solo in the break to try to make the score 17-5 in Ayr's favor.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's performance by Baggott reduced the relegation to five points.
There was then a long delay due to Ruaried Knott's serious injury, which forced him to sit out and after the game resumed, the Air Club moved further forward through the action of Stafford McDowell, performed by Climó.
Blair McPherson, acting captain of the Air Club, was then presented with a yellow paper and Melrose paid the extra man again for the unperformed actions of Bruce Colvin during the period at the end of the intense pressure.
However, the owners of the pitch came to them and when the yellow paper was given to Struan Hutchinson for holding Climax without a ball, he scored a touchdown from the line of the charge field behind the ear's bowling alley near the ball.
After Kyle Rowe had hit David Armstrong's penalty area and sent out the flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth action of the owners, Climone performed as he had done since the start.
Still Game star plans to start a new career in the restaurant industry
After being appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company, Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to make the transition to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he co-wrote and co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series on the show and appear to be planning a life after Kirnan Craiglang.
According to official documents, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the incident, but Scottish Sun reported that Kirnan had plans to work in a thriving restaurant in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: no way to go to sea Bolivia hopes to reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
And the words of the sea-base, from the lake of Tithika to the river Amazon, are, According to the law, the sea is ours.
It is our duty to take it back.
Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, still has a reminder of the beach that was crossed to Chile in the 19th century resource dispute and the desire to swim again in the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest level in the last decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
 Bolivia has a spirit of aspiration, unity and peace and it certainly expects a positive outcome,  said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilia.
Many Bolivians monitor the international court's decision through large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will support Bolivia's demand that after decades of contentious negotiations, Chile must negotiate an independent sea route for Bolivia.
The decision on Monday is also crucial for Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian resident from the indigenous population who is also in contention over his re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Black Sea", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts said that the decision to appeal the case to Bolivia is unlikely, and we believe that the decision will have a negative impact on the case.
The UN office in the Netherlands said it was not authorized to support the territory of Chile and could not decide the outcome of the negotiations.
The International Court of Justice's decision to issue the final ruling within six months of the hearing proves that the case is not as elaborate as previously thought, said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And Bolivia is not at all ready to end the case, as it has been for the past four years.
The current leadership of Bolivia is illegally using the issue of the right to go to sea,  Zarate said.
He assumed that Morales' declarations of war would destroy the rest of Chile's reputation.
Bolivia and Chile will interview sooner or later, and then it will be difficult to argue.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, disagreed with the view that the court's decision to issue a speedy ruling would raise doubts.
He said that Monday will be a unique moment for Bolivia to open a new era of relations with Chile and will bring an opportunity to end a 139-year-old dispute with equal benefits for both sides.
Caldasilla also disapproved of Morales' use of maritime issues as political support by one of Latin America's most famous presidents.
Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific Ocean".

North Korea says that if the US is not trusted, there will be no nuclear disarmament
North Korean Prime Minister Ri Yang-ho said that if the people do not trust Washington, they will never allow nuclear disarmament.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United Nations to keep its promise made at the summit with the leaders of competing countries in Singapore.
He began to express his views when he saw that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was ready to reopen the issue of nuclear diplomacy, which he had been imprisoned in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for more than three months.
The US refusal to make an official statement on the end of the Korean War and the mass-imposed measures will not bring the North to its knees, Ri said.
Washington is threatening to make an official statement until Pyongyang takes the first step towards mass disarmament.
Kim, including US President Donald Trump, felt that a second summit was needed.
However, there is also some doubt that Pyongyang's refusal to disarm is likely to be accepted as the only way to maintain security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month as part of the second Kim-Trump summit.
The headwear that was presented to everyone at the Paris Fashion Show has been seen in the distance, and will soon be available to you.
If you want to make my fancy skirts big or hide from the sun as much as possible, you don't have to look.
Designers like Valentino and Tom Brown have continued to show off their unusual, unobtrusive headscarves on the podium in their summer 2019 packages, which have gone beyond the usual theme of Paris Fashion Week.
The uncertainties didn't go away on Instagram this summer, and the famous designers put their eye-catching works on the podium.
Valentino's signature work was a large, white-yellow cap with a wide-brimmed pencil, which was not even visible under the ornaments that were worn.
Other large-sized accessories include precious stones, magical figures, and even pineapples, but they are not designed for mainstream use.
Tom Brown also offered a collection of bizarre masks, something that Halloween doesn't like.
Many of the masks were sewn together, not in high fashion, but in the form of Hannibal's Lechs.
One was a watercolor costume with a breathing tube and a swimming eye, and the other was a melted ice cream cone.
If you're a regular fashion assessor, this is your chance.
Art experts suggest that it's quite possible that you'll find female motifs on the street.
The globalised caps were hung from a two-foot-wide, two-foot-wide, side-shaped cap, called La Bomb, worn by Rihanna to Emily Ratkowski.
After the social system was conquered, the country was worshiped, another piece of art came to the podium  a sack of saffron that held it on the same beach as the swimsuit on the suit of the decorated swimmer who held it.
The bag of yellow-red raffin fibers, covered with raffin hair and white leather cap, was featured in Jacques La Rivera's 2019 Summer Package at Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the next summer to be a big-size bag and beach bag available to the public, because after the huge impact of the designer, large-size accessories should not be overlooked.
John Edward: Language learning is important for the citizens of the world
Scottish private schools have maintained high standards of education, and in addition to achieving high marks in exams in 2018, individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other collective activities have continued this trend.
Private schools, which operate on behalf of the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS) with over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, aim to provide a high level of service to both pupils and their parents.
Private schools prepare their students for further education, higher education, career choice and world citizenship.
As an education sector that can develop and implement a unified school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages emerge as a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, you're going to make a difference.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, your words will reach his heart.
And these are powerful words about how we can't just trust English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
As the results of the recent examination this year show, languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest achievement rates in private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages got high marks A.
According to information provided by 74 representative schools of SCIS, 72 percent of students received A grades above Chinese, 72 percent of students received A grades above German, 69 percent of students received French and 63 percent of students received A grades above Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language learning as a skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
In the private school curriculum and other subjects of choice, accuracy is given equal importance to languages alongside science (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK's Employment and Vocational Training Commission found that 17 percent of employers' reasons for not being able to take up jobs were due to the low language skills of the prospects.
Therefore, language education is becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for careers.
In the context of job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career choice a person chooses, learning a second language increases the chances of using this kind of long-term skills.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners puts a person who speaks multiple languages above all others.
According to YouGov, in 2013, the number of adults in English who could not speak another language at the level of conversation exceeded 4,000 (75 percent), while those who could only speak French as a second language reached a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to pay attention to teaching children languages today.
Knowing multiple languages, especially those of developed economies, will increase children's chances of finding effective work.
In Scotland, each school is different in the languages taught there.
While some schools teach some classical modern languages, others will teach Chinese or Japanese, which will be of particular importance to the UK in 2020.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will be a variety of languages to choose from in private schools, and teachers are considered experts in this field.
Private schools in Scotland prepare children for success and develop the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
We cannot deny that languages are very important for the future of the country in the global business environment, and that this requirement must be introduced into the education sector.
However, we should recognize that modern languages are actually interpersonal skills at an international level.
Private schools will continue to offer Scottish youth this choice, diversity and higher education.
So let it be .
John Edward Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans who were waiting for their first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers were almost overwhelmed.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that he would play James Denver Naggets on Sunday in the season opener in San Diego.
We'll see how many minutes he can play.
More than once, less than 48  said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Traddell wrote on Twitter that James could play for a limited time.
After training this week, the Lakers asked James to play in the six-game regular season schedule.
He said that at this time of my life, I don't need any seasonal games to prepare.
Trump's election campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a campaign of pre-election rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia, this evening.
This is the first of five Trump meetings planned this week, when counting stops in co-operative places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting to confirm his nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump will increase his support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing the support of Congress during the November vote.
What time does the Trump campaign begin tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's pre-election rally is expected to begin at 7 p.m. eastern time in Wheeling, West Virginia, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election campaign in West Virginia online via the live YouTube channel below.
Trump is going to talk about the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, which means that the Senate has delayed the vote by a week until the FBI has completed its investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help the Republicans consolidate their position before the November elections.
So, the five meetings of President Trump scheduled for next week are to encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and lower house of Congress, Reuters reports.
Controlling Congress is a very important task on his agenda, so the president will try to visit as many states as possible before the start of the election season,  a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The pre-election rally in the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling is expected to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the rally will undoubtedly attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media on the West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia since last month, thanks to the state that won 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the vote.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president himself came to raise his vote spirit", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows its readiness to fight for victory ahead of Sunday ' s individual games
After three knockout races, the four who played Saturday night again qualified for the Ryder Cup.
The pencil-fighting pace is a pure sport, but it is highly desirable for athletes, especially in such competitions.
The question is, where is this momentum now?
"They were six points ahead, now four, and I think we're moving a little bit faster", said Jordan Spitzer on his way back that day.
Europe, which has won by 20 points and four points, certainly has the advantage.
Speat said the Americans still have an undefeated streak, but there are plenty of inspiring moments, especially when they've played together all day and they're proud of three out of four points each.
The spit can be a model of the spit itself and not be blown in front of the pitch.
When Thomas and he played a double-quarter, they dropped the ball into the hole and tied the score four times, and the victory screams came from the grave.
His winning touchdown in the game was met with a 15 minute salute, a sign that the Americans were still in the game.
"You have to be very enthusiastic and focus on your party", Spit said.
All of the players mentioned have now retired from the game.
There are 18 holes.
The players who have outscored Spit and Tommas in points over the past two days  Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, will undoubtedly remain in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird but attractive couple is four out of four who never miss a thing.
And they did not go out to the door of the gate on the Sabbath, but they did not go out to the door of the gate on the Sabbath morning, and on the Friday morning, and on the Friday morning, and they did not go out to the door of the gate on the last nine holes.
The energy exchange with that cut and unrestrained audience made them the winners of Sunday, a day that was Le Golf Nation's birthday compared to Fleetwood or Molinari, and showed that there was no other famous player to defend Europe's name.
It's better for both of them to fall into the same hole.
There are stories of European glory, and how much haste there is.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went out on a date with Alex Noren in the morning game and escaped the four-ball partner Sergio Garcia.
The first half of the game saw a bogie and two double strokes, which took the Spanish and Swedish to the second, but stuck.
But it seems that no one can help us out on Sunday.
Four-ball strikes and four-balls are worth a closer look at because of the interaction between the couples, their advice and advice and their attitude to the change in strategy at a moment's notice.
Europe has played better as a group so far and in the face of the final day, some, especially those in the states, have doubted, but these four parties have shown that the US team is ready to fight for victory.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe failed to play well in the Ryder Cup final after beating the United States 10-6 after four knockout matches and four draws on Saturday.
The legendary Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari pair left Tiger Woods two wins behind, but Le Golf managed to reach the National League by four points.
Thomas Björn's European side was determined to reclaim the trophy that had been won for two years at Hazeltin, defeating the four balls that missed America this morning by a 3-1 series.
The United States had more hope for the four that won the two matches, but they were uncertain because they were short of points.
Jim Furrick missed eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the win.
Fleetwood became the first young player in Europe to score four consecutive points, while Molinari and he beat the Moliwood pair to a home run and became the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points in four opening matches of the season after a controversial Sunday.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed by four balls, they played a fantastic joint game to beat Woods and American young player Bryson DeChambo by a further 5 and 4 points.
Woods, who pulled himself out of two matches on Saturday, showed some notable moments, but now he is seventh on the list, having lost 19 of 29 matches in four knockouts and four games.
Justin Rose, breathing in the morning's four-ball strokes, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the quarter-finals, defeating the world number one and third-placed Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, 2-1.
Europe was watching all this in the cozy, windy southwest of Paris every day.
Three-time winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a new record by bringing two points to the Americans on Sunday.
They defeated the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Poulter 2-1 in four-ball strokes and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McAiry, who had missed two holes, 4-3 in the fourth.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has only returned to individual games twice after falling short of four points, but supporters have been with Furyk only to recover the victory.
After two days as the second best, it seems that he was left behind after the attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it is impossible to disarm unilaterally without trust
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that the ongoing protests on Saturday would increase the distrust of the United States and that the country could not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general assembly last year that North Korea had taken "significant beneficial measures" such as halting nuclear and missile weapons tests, closing the nuclear test site, promising the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But he said that we were not getting anything back from the US.
Don't think that if we don't trust the United States, we're going to endanger our own national security, and we're going to be the first to begin disarmament.
While Ri repeated North Korean protests against Washington's well-known opposition to the disarmament method, which North Korea was expected to receive due credit for its periodic actions, his statement also denied that Pyongyang had previously unintentionally accepted unilateral disarmament.
At the first summit between the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, Ri advanced a joint statement between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, in which Kim pledged to work toward the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula, while Trump promised to maintain North Korea's security.
Although North Korea wanted to officially end the 1950-53 war, the United States insisted that it should first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to ease the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States is increasing pressure to achieve its goal by demanding nuclear disarmament and by imposing sanctions and opposing the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The idea that we can be defeated by sanctions is an impossible dream for those who do not know about us.
But the non-repeal of sanctions is weakening our faith.
Ri said nothing about the US leader's plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which he had previously spoken about at the UN.
Instead, the minister mentioned the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying that if the other side of the issue were South Korea, not the US, the Korean nuclear disarmament would not be so tight.
But Ri's voice was not as powerful as last year, when Ri told the UN General Assembly that President Trump's "slander" of Kim as a spaceman on a death mission had led to the launch of North Korean missiles into the United States.
Trump, who last year vowed to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim's courage in implementing disarmament measures this year, but said that there was still a lot to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that whether it's two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter, and he's not going to limit the time.
China and Russia believe that Pyongyang should be rewarded for its efforts.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: "Until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament is achieved, sanctions must continue actively and inevitably".
In 2006, the Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea to halt Pyongyang's financial programs on nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo said that Rome had met informally at the UN General Assembly and would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang and said the case was progressing, but soon North Korea accused him of imposing gangster demands.
North Korea promised at its meeting with Moon this month that if the US took appropriate measures, it would dismantle its missile and nuclear complexes.
He said Kim was looking for the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he was focused on improving relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on adequate rest
To combat the night-time macho culture of caffeine, Harvard University has started a course this year that will make all students sleep more.
Academic number one found that students at the university didn't know how to expect.
Charles Chessler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course and said that this had never happened before in the United States.
She wanted to start this course after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects reading.
And it came to pass after the end of the school day, that a girl came to me, and said, Why am I not yet in high school?
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep before, and that surprised me, says The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, provides basic insights into how good sleep skills can help academic and sporting success, as well as improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, says that after learning that students are not sleeping well for a week, the university decided to include this course.
The one-hour course consists of several interactive tasks.
One of these chapters provides a picture of the bedrooms, where students print coffee cups, curtains, mattresses and books, telling them about the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep deprivation affects sports outcomes, and the importance of sleeping time.
In another section, participants with prolonged sleep apnea were at increased risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map with interactive features will encourage participants to reflect on their daily lives.
We know that this will not change the lives of students immediately.
But they have a right to know, like you have a right to know about the health risks of smoking, Professor Chessler added.
He said that the culture of sleeplessness is still alive, and that modern technology and the pressure on students is increasing the problem of lack of sleep.
He says that getting enough sleep should be a secret weapon for stress, grief and anxiety, and not even for excess weight, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to be alert and hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and physical biology from California, helped develop the course for Chase, who took one of Chase's classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He says that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduates to undergo a similar curriculum before entering a highly competitive institution.
Professor Chessler advises students to put on a wake-up clock to help them fall asleep, and to learn about the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and light diodes (which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems).
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: Menga scored a goal against Gerard ' s boys
The Rangers suffered another setback on the field, as Dolly Menga's 1-0 defeat of Steven Gerrard's team in Livingston.
After Ibrahimovic's 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, although he tried to win the game on the pitch for the first time, Gary Holt's team brought him only the second loss in 18 games as Gerrard's manager, resulting in a loss of eight points to Huddersfield's Ladbrokes Premier League leader.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and there was no incentive to match points in the Rangers.
Rangers were relegated to sixth place, while Livingston was relegated to third place, where he was only behind Hiberniaen by a goal difference.
After linear referee Callum Spence injured his head with a throw from a distant end, additional issues could arise for the Rangers.
Gerrard made eight changes to the pitch and made it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup outside of Ayr.
On the one hand, Holt was out with the Livi 11, who had scored from Hart last week, and would have been very happy that his well-trained army had defeated the opponent.
While the Rangers had more balls, Livingston used his best shot more effectively.
They had forced Scott Pittman to score a goal for Allan McGregor when Menga was released for the first time, but the midfielder never missed his chance.
Although Keegan Jacobs' deep-lying charge reached team captain Craig Halkett, his defensive partner Alan Litgow was only able to make a strong back-off.
Although the Rangers took control, hope prevailed over confidence in the final third of the game.
A quarter of an hour later, Alfredo Morelos believed I had a chance to get a penalty because he had a falling out with Stephen Lawless, but the judge Stephen Thomson refused the Colombian petition.
The Rangers scored two runs in the first innings, but the strikes of Lassa Culibali and Ovie Edgariya were not difficult for former IBROX goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Although Livi's action in the 34th minute was against the game, no one doubts that they deserved it for their efforts.
Again, the Rangers could not do anything about Jacobs' deep-throating strike.
Scott Arfield did not respond, because Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to send it to Menga to finish the game.
Gerrard acted during the break and replaced Cooley with Ryan Kent, a change that took effect almost immediately.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to the game they had learned, and Lithgow and Halcott kept the ball long.
Although the Holt side retained their lead for a long time in the latter stages, Lithgow faced McGregor Jacobs before making a wide angle attack.
Glenn Middleton had clashed with Jacobs, who had just moved to the Ranger, and had asked for another penalty, but Thompson refused again.
Almanach: Geiger invented the calculator
And now, the Almanac of Sandy Morning: 136 years ago, on September 30, 1882, and in SANAY BERGEN... the future physicist Hans Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later became the device known as the Geiger calculator.
Since then, Geiger has been the basis of pop culture, as in the 1950 film, Coronado Bells, where ordinary cowpox scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is common?
Rogers: This is a Geiger calculator that is used to identify radioactive minerals like uranium.
And when you put these ears on, you can actually hear the effects of the radioactivity of the atoms in the minerals.
Evans: It will be known now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, shortly after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to see defective cells
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to kill defective cells
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the lab.
And then they can see the protein common to many cancers and they can re-introduce it.
The vaccine is showing good results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to see defective cells lost her breast cancer within 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the lab so that he can re-introduce them into a common protein called HER2 in many cancers.
Jay Berzowski, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that the vaccine has a future".
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer" (including breast, ovarian, lung and cochlear cancer).
The method of removing immune cells from patients, teaching them how to affect cancer cells, helped to treat leukemia.
Kanye showed up on SNL wearing a MAGA mask to support Trump.
Failed to complete
Kanye West was widely criticized after praising US President Donald Trump on Saturday night and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After singing his third song, "Let's Give America Back the Glory", he spoke out against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people a lot, and they say, 'How do you love Trump, he's racist?'"
Okay, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America".
The SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, who mocked Brett Kavanagh's response to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blassy Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Although Wes's words were not broadcast on television, his video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock intended to make fun of West with his recording.
And West told herself that it was hard to wear that hat outside the stage.
"They tried to scare me off stage.
They said, "Do not go out with your clothes on".
They scared me!
They said I was where I was .
And West continues, "Do you want to see the water? So I'm gonna wear Superman's clothes, because you can't tell me what to do.
Start with love".
His speech was ignored by audiences at least twice, and the cast of SNL seemed confused.
West had replaced his former lover, Mac Miller, with Arianne Grande, who had died a few days earlier.
It was uncommon for West to dress up like a bottle of Perrier and sing I Love it.
Kennedy Turner, leader of the conservative TPUSA group, supported West and tweeted, "Thank you to one of the most courageous people: THE MANY THINGS TO BACK THE MAFIA".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Wes was still in his condition and that was amazing.
But I prefer not to praise someone who promotes a harmful ideology in my community (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art).
He is free.
We did too", he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on his Twitter that he had changed his name to Kanye West, officially known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following in the footsteps of Diddie, who was once known as Puff Daddie, Puffy, and Pi Diddie.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and Prince, who would become a music legend later, changed his name to a symbol and became famous under that name.
Accused of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with stabbing at Belfast restaurant
On Friday, after stabbing a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast, a 45-year-old man was charged with attempted rape.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhacamore.
The accused is expected to answer before the Belfast Graduate Court on Monday.
The charges are considered by the State Prosecutor.
The star of the fight of the right, Keith Harington, has expressed opposition to male behavior
Keith Harington is best known for his role as John Snow, the swordsmith in HBO's violent fantasy series The Struggle of the Middle Ages.
But the 31-year-old actor has broken the stereotype of a macho character, saying that such roles on screen make young children think they have to be rude to feel respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that something was wrong and raised the issue of how to address the issue of male harmful behavior in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, who co-starred in the TV series The Right to Life, said he feels "very strongly" about this issue.
I feel a little strong myself, so what have we done wrong with the manly behavior?
What have we taught the people about the present?
Whale believes that television may be responsible for the increase in male behavior due to the presence of overly masculine characters.
And he said, What is it that is born, and what is it that teacheth?
What is it that young children are taught on TV and in the streets that makes them think that a real man should be like this?
I think this is one of the biggest issues of our time, and how can we change it?
Because it's obvious that something is wrong with young children.
In an interview, he said that after the series ended the following year, he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels of the Tactical Dispute because he was a fan of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Keith will be in the movie "The Real West" about Sam Shepard's film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor considers his meeting with his wife Rose to be the most amazing event in the history of the franchise.
In this show, I met my wife, so she gave me my future wife and from this moment on, my new life, he says.
Rose plays the favorite character, John Snow, played by Keith, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China says new cases have increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
According to official health officials, this amounts to 820,000 people in the country.
A total of 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The difference is that most of the new cases have been through sex.
HIV was usually transmitted in China by transfusion of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said that such cases are almost uncommon.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sexual contact is a topical issue in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, discrimination against LGBT representatives still exists.
Because the country adheres to conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
The disease is often transmitted by improper protection during sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, China has promised to make HIV drugs publicly available to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employees have been distributing information from Republican Party senators and creates a theory of dangerous lies and deceptive actions
Republican Party spokesman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican Party senators to the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat alleged that the website was fabricated by ultra-conscious experts.
"Lies, lies and lies beyond", Waters tweeted.
The information released included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday and was made by an unknown person in the Capitol during a Senate hearing charging Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh with sexual activity.
The news spread after three senators investigated Kavanaugh.
According to conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState , the IP address that identifies the source of the message is associated with the Office of Waters and the information was published by one of the Waters employees (Hill).
This unfounded statement is completely false and absolutely false, Waters continues.
One of my employees, who was exposed to this fraudulent and false information, and his personal information and security were compromised, is not responsible for the spread of this information.
This unfounded statement is completely false and absolutely false
Waters' statement was criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fletcher.
This denial was made furiously,  writes Fletcher.
This means that his character does not want to be a member of Congress.
If a man is condemned for a thing he has not done, let him not be angry.
This should not go out of the wind.
They must not question the accuser's motives.
They must remain in their condition".
The court apparently compared the reaction of Fletcher Waters to Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, who will represent Waters in the Republican midterm elections, also tweeted his game.
"If it's true, it's big, ", he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned the law enforcement and administrative authorities about these fraudulent complaints.
We will make the criminals public,  he continued,  they will be held accountable to the law for the dangerous actions they have committed against each of my employees.
Johnny English is back  Rowan Atkinson ' s stupid spy
Now I'm looking for Brexit signs from new films that traditionally feature British actors, which obviously also includes the re-release of the Johnny English movie franchise, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned with Johnny English in 2011 with Reeborn.
Can our own satire about our worthlessness be a new export opportunity for our country?
However, with his eyes wide open, his rubbery face flexible, Johnny English is getting a second chance to perform, which means his comedy work is focused on non-English-speaking areas of cinema.
Despite her ridiculous hope for perfect glamour, she certainly has something to do with a little Clooney, a little Mr. Bean and a little guy who contributed to the melody Chariots of Fire at the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony.
It was originally based on the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, which featured the traveler and mysterious soul international Atkinson, who created a tabletop around the world.
There are a couple of good things about the last round of JI.
I liked that Johnny English came in a mid-century vase in a helicopter and the rotor hooks were tenting his headgear.
Atkinson's physical comedy is prized, but the humor seems weak and superior, because 007 and the impossible mission itself are often saturated with comedic moments.
Humor is not for adults, it's for kids, and I think what Johnny English was going through was not as funny and comical as Atkinson's Bean comedy.
The constantly showing precondition  is to show that the UK has big issues at the moment.
The cyber-hacker infiltrated a highly classified network of British spies, revealing the identities of British agents working in various locations, and seizing the terror of the deputy agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon's role is small).
The arrogant and uncompromising prime minister, suffering from the loss of her political reputation, is losing patience: Emma Thompson is willing to sacrifice for the quasi-Theresa-May character, but she cannot go beyond the script.
According to his intelligence advisers, all spies were public, and he will now be forced to recall those who have resigned.
This means that Johnny English, who is now a teacher at a very powerful school, but who teaches informal lessons about being a secret operative, has some good jokes, because English offers a spy academy in the form of a Rock School.
English returns to Whitehall for urgent instruction and rejoins the suffering Buff (also Ben Miller).
Buff is a married man who is subordinate to the commander of a submarine.
In this way, Batman and Robin, who have a variety of interests, reenter the secret service of Her Majesty and thus meet the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And the Prime Minister, who thought he could solve Britain's computer problems, sat in the chair of Jason Volta (played by Jake Lacy).
English and Buff begin their odyssey of wild jokes: dressed as a butcher, they set fire to a French restaurant; secretly break into Walt's luxurious yacht and destroy it; English produces a table around Walt's house, using virtual reality to explore the interior.
All of this is done for the final series of events, but the overly noisy action is like a children's TV.
The middle class.
I also looked at other films by Johnny English and wondered if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that suited his talents.
Labour believes that getting five days' pay for four days of work is too radical for the British.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party believes that getting five days' pay for four days of work is too radical for the British.
The party wants the heads of companies to give employees additional rest at the expense of savings resulting from the revolution in the field of artificial intelligence.
And they rested three days, and were given their wages.
According to the sources, the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and the plan to turn the country in the interests of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved at the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "The political review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek  is considered an attempt to rebalance the economy in the interests of the worker, as well as in line with the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Green Party, not the Labour Party, was the first to support this idea, following a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations are not fully established.
Representative of the Labour Party: The four-day work week is not partisan politics, it is not partisan.
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell held a Labour conference last week to predict the socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell said that the decision to reinstate the powers of the neutral directors and speculators in the public utilities was taken.
The shadow chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to repay their shares, as the Labour Party is likely to make debts on the basis of its actions contrary to the proposed law.
He also confirmed plans to incorporate employees of the company into the board of directors and create an inclusive ownership fund, according to which employees can receive a dividend of £500 per year by transferring a 10 percent share of the private sector capital.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy 60 minutes FBI investigation of the Kavanaugh case said whether or not they could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh withdrew the decisive vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court less than a week later, and raised the question of whether the bureau's decision might force the Republican senators to support him.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find a reason to change their views.
Kennedy preferred to be more open about the game than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, I think so", Kennedy said.
I said that, and I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh while I was going to the court.
And after this thing, and after the judgment of the accused, I spoke with him, and said, Hast thou done this?
He showed courage, perseverance, and did not act in a way that aroused doubt.
But Graham was not happy with his decision.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is clear and I need a strong case against him", he said.
 Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened then, but I do know this clearly: Brett refused to admit it, and he added that Graham did so in response to Christina Blaszy Ford.
None of the witnesses could prove the facts of these things.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't notice any change in that.
What is the significance of the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the annual Global Citizen Festival, a music event featuring some of the biggest stars in the world, with a major goal of ending global poverty.
On the seventh anniversary of the birth of Global Citizen, tens of thousands of people will not only attend the grand opening of Central Park to see the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global poverty eradication by 2030, which is the main goal of this event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international human rights organization that aims to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket, of course), listeners must perform a number of important tasks or tasks aimed at raising awareness about the purpose of volunteering, writing a letter to a world leader, calling or other poverty alleviation.
But just 12 years before the goal was reached, how successful was Global Citizen?
Is the real way to get people to play a free concert to demand that people be called to action, or is it another example of this cliché that people believe that by signing an online petition or tweeting, they are making a real difference?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, the organization has organized more than 19 million events for various purposes with the help of its supporters.
According to them, these events have encouraged world leaders to announce commitments and demands worth more than $ 37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group made a briefing on 390 tasks and announcements resulting from organized events, and at least $10 billion of them were raised or spent.
The fund, which is funded by the Group, has directly impacted the lives of about 649 million people worldwide.
One of the key objectives of Global Citizens is to call the Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of executives and British investors who pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help children reach their full potential after collecting 4,700 tweets on behalf of Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, we can make historic references to the social injustices of poor nutrition,  The Power of Nutrition's Ambassador Tracy Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
In addition, the organisation said that over 5,000 events have been organized in the UK to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, and the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which includes nearly 5 million women and children.
The question that is on the list of VAT listed on their website is: Why are we confident that we will win the fight against poverty?
Global citizen responded, "It's going to be a long, hard road, and sometimes we can fall, sometimes we can fail.
But like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger when we work together.
This year, New York City will host a show hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman, with stars such as Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bee, and Janelle Monet.
US to seek the help of the Navy to build a new nuclear power plant for Russian energy exports , Interior Minister said
According to the US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, Washington will use the Navy if necessary to prevent the introduction of Russian energy into the market, including the Middle East.
Zinka believes that Russia's involvement in the Syrian issue, including the legal government's invitation to act, is the beginning of the exploration of the new energy market.
I believe that the purpose of their activities in the Middle East is based on the need to find energy brokers, such as those in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe, he said in his report.
In addition, the shenian said that there are ways and means to solve this problem.
The United States has the potential to do this with the help of the Navy, which is to open sea lanes, or, if necessary, to block the entry of Russian energy into the market he said.
Zinka dedicated this report to the participants of the event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance and the non-profit organization that declared itself the voice of the energy consumers of the United States.
He then compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, which is to say that they are practically the same.
The importance of the economic issue with regard to Russia and Iran does not extend beyond the question of efficient use of fuel and fuel replacement, he said, describing Russia as an economically dependent  limited transport  with limited activity on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration has been accustomed to the fact that it has been able to accelerate the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and sell it to European consumers at a lower price.
This is why the Trump administration's top officials, as well as US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to reject a pipeline project like Nord Stream 2, which Trump believed would destroy Berlin by Moscow.
Moscow, in turn, proved that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of 110 billion cubic meters of pipeline, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin said that Washington's opposition to the project was based on economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
I am convinced that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that we share our views on the right of consumers to choose their producers, the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow in September with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.
Germany opposed this US position and confirmed its unwavering position on the project.
The German Production Federation (BDI), Germany's leading manufacturing organization, has requested that the United States not interfere in the EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The interference of third parties in our energy supply process is a great inconvenience for us  said the head of the German Production Federation (BDI) Dieter Kempf after the recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will be taking control of the 2020 presidential nomination, according to the Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that she would be taking over the running of the presidential candidate during the midterm elections.
During a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren announced that he had plans to run.
According to Hill, it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and it was important for her to have a woman at the head of the state.
After November 6, I will have strict control over the candidacy for the presidency.
During the city council meeting, Warren criticized President Donald Trump as "leading his country in the wrong direction".
I am really very disturbed by Donald Trump's actions against our democracy, he said.
Warren Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were openly critical.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, before we vote, we need to investigate the FBI first".
The poll was published on Thursday, however, Warren's majority of voters were reportedly against his bid for the 2020 election.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters reported that a senator was running unopposed.
Thirty-two percent wanted to run for office.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy had more support, meaning that 38% of voters voted against him, while 48% voted against him.
As for the list of other high-level Democrats involved in the 2020 election, it's important to note that Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders also did.
According to the Associated Press, Biden's official decision will be announced by January.
Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin during the political race of Donald Trump
Track Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested on Monday for domestic violence.
I can tell you about other animals who are suffering from PTSD and other war injuries, seeing what my son is going through, she said during a rally in front of Donald in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin compares her capture to the elephant in the room and asks if her son and other veterans are slightly changed and glorified and if there is any respect for their military comrades and pilots, the army of any other country, giving to their country.
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilai Police Department, she was arrested in Vasilai, Alaska, for domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, District of Columbia, support a dispute over new housing policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a new U.S. law that prohibits providing shelter to gang or domestic violence victims.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and counties in Washington on Friday registered the information of the assistant judge and supported the asylum seeker who opposed the policy.
The full name and address of the plaintiff in the Grace  Session lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal law in August, was not disclosed.
She said that her companion and her son, a member of the band, had abused her, but on July 20, the Cheneuins refused to give her shelter.
He was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors who supported Grace described countries with high asylum demands in the United States, such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as countries where gang and domestic violence were widespread.
The new US policy in 2014 ended the decision of the Immigration Appeals Board to allow immigrants who had been victims of domestic violence to apply for asylum without documents.
The District Attorney General of the District of Columbia said in his statement that the new policy would "refuse the annual state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all applications for housing be considered on the basis of factual facts and complaints, and such a ban violates this principle  says the assistant judge.
Prosecutors say the policy of banning immigrants from entering the US has a negative impact on the US economy, as they are often entrepreneurs and provide the "necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has banned immigration courts from providing shelter to gangs or victims of domestic violence.
Residence is granted to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of belonging to a particular social group or political opinion due to race, religion, nationality or political opinion,  said Session in his statement on June 11.
The magazine is not dedicated to solving all the problems that are happening every day around the world, including the most difficult.
Rescue operations in Palau are in a difficult situation, and the number of dead found during the search for survivors is doubling.
The situation for the survivors is becoming increasingly difficult.
A 35-year-old mother, who is looking after her fever-prone child in the evacuation center of the city of Palau, said: "It is very difficult.
Every minute, people are being brought to the emergency room.
There is no clean water.
And the inhabitants shall return to their houses, which are broken, and shall dig up their things which are in the mire, and shall seek to save all that is possible.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which filled hospitals.
One of the injured, who broke his hip and shoulder, was placed near the Dvi Harris Palo military hospital, where patients were treated under open skies due to severe shock.
And he wept, when he remembered the earthquake, and the fifth floor of the inn where he was staying, when the earthquake shook his wife and his daughter.
We were not able to defend ourselves.
I felt like I was walking into a broken wall, Harris told the Associated Press, and she also said that her boyfriend was at a party in town at the time.
And I heard the voice of my wife, and there was silence.
I don't know what happened to my son and her.
I hope they are safe, , .
US ambassador accuses China of advertising propaganda
After the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the American daily newspaper about mutually beneficial trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
After US President Donald Trump accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections on Wednesday, China Daily promoted a paid subscription to the best-selling Iowa newspaper Des Moines Register, but China denied it.
Trump's accusation of Beijing interfering in the US elections marks a new stage in Trump's increased pressure on China, US officials told Reuters.
While advertising to improve trade is a common practice for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are currently intensifying their trade wars and are consequently imposing the same tariffs on each other for imports.
Chinese and American experts say the Chinese response tariffs are targeted at exporters in states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, who was the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, believes Beijing has caused damage to American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Des Moines Register, Branstad said that China is now making a promotional ad for our free press, making things worse.
 By distributing the news, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and press freedom by giving paid advertising to the Des Moines Register newspaper,  writes Branstad.
Instead, you see limited counter-votes in Beijing and you don't see the true picture of the variety of opinions about China's difficult economic trajectory. It's important to note that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,  he says.
He also said that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish it, but did not say which.
Experts warn women voters to be excluded from themselves before the Kavano deadline
As the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is supported and defended by many high-ranking Republicans, experts say that there will be a negative reaction from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
It caused too much emotion and most Republicans were able to declare that they wanted to have the upper hand in the vote.
There's no going back to that, says Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Richer said he was not confident that Senator Jeff Flake (R.  Ariz.) would have been able to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation to calm the angry voters.
According to the Washington County Journal, "Women will not forget yesterday today, tomorrow, or November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive movement MoveOn.
After Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, the protest group shouted in the Senate corridor on Friday morning, "Money is coming".
Political scientist Steve Rothenberg, who is not a party member, said on his news website: "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are out of the box".
 People say it's too high, and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women who don't like the president, who don't vote, and those who are 18-29 years old".
Until Ford's full public statement that he accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual assault, experts had predicted that if further confirmation were given, the response would be a reaction.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said earlier this week that the Republican Party had not found a solution to the problem.
Referring to the news channel, It's not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or Kavanaugh's seat as a judge, but also how Republicans decide and how they view it", says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected.
But it seems that Americans are divided by which of the two people is going to believe in what Ford and Kavanaugh say.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's statement is actually true or likely to be true, while 35 percent believe Kavanaugh's statement is actually true or likely to be true.
And while 38 percent of respondents believe that Kavanagh lied in response, 30 percent think so about Ford.
According to The Guardian, following Flake's statement, the FBI is considering at least one other defendant, including Ford, Deborah Ramirez's statement.
Last week, Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Committee on Oaths that he had met her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez was a Yale student in the 1980s when one night, on a vacation, a Supreme Court nominee told him that she had shown him her sex.
The inventor of the Internet is planning to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, is about to launch a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest Inrupt project in the technology legend is a company based on the Berners-Lee Solid open platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can view what information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee Inrupt joked that the goal of global domination.
This is what we need to do now, he said about the startup.
This is  historical moment
The application uses Solid technology, which helps people create their own personal online data storage (or POD).
It may include a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a collection of music, and other personal, professional tools.
It's all available from the same browser at the same time, like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
The characteristic of a personal data storage is that it is dependent on the user who can access some information.
The company calls this "data-driven personalization".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to make Solid available to everyone by providing all the resources, processes and skills required.
The company currently includes a security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, and an association of several staff developers and volunteer programmers who have contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee says he and his team have not talked to Facebook or Google about whether or not to implement a full update that can fully update all business models in an hour.
We don't ask them for permission.
In an article published on Sunday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission To provide commercial power and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based grid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, he has been an influential figure in the debate about the neutrality of the Berners-Lee network.
Even when Inrupt was created, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I'm looking forward to the next era of the Internet, says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest of the First World War awarded the Victoria Cross
The only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was awarded 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Bernard Vann took Belenglish and Leucor on 29 September 1918 during the invasion.
But he didn't know that four days later he was killed by a sniper and received his highest British military award.
The monument was presented by his two grandchildren on Saturday at the Rushden march in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that his father's stone was found 100 years after he was awarded the honor.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Col Vann led his battalion through the Channel of Saint-Canton in a thick fog and under a rifle and gunpowder.
He then ran to the battle line and led it forward with great courage, before he ran to the sword with one hand and destroyed three troops.
Lieutenant Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says he never knew he would be fit to do his father's job.
After a march led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, he and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said he was very proud to have participated in the campaign and that the bravery of the brave warrior was expressed by the support of many people.
MMA fans were surprised to see the Bellato instead of the Peppá stall
MMA fans did not sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206, which was offered in a package, but instead featured Peppa's station.
The San Jose report consisted of 13 fights, six of which were part of the main package and were broadcast live overnight on 5th Avenue in the United Kingdom.
At 6am, while Geegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the British audience was switching to a different broadcast.
The audience who hadn't slept until the morning for the night was not happy about it.
One fan tweeted that the change to a children's cartoon was a bit of a joke.
When asked about the program, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, replied that   Content was not in line with the government's decision, and they were forced to switch to a children's program, which at 6 am   .
All the Peppas are compatible.
The president of Bellator says they are planning to reach the UK audience in the future.
I think when we think about playing again, we can solve it, says Cocker.
And it was six o'clock in the morning of the first day of the week; and we could not do this until the first day of the week, nor until the second day of the week.
But we're working on that.
When he spoke, he began to speak out against each other.
We tried to fix it, and we thought there was a technical flaw.
But that didn't happen, it was a state issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We're limited to five fights instead of the usual six, and we've tried to reach the fans and we've been able to do that.
This was not successful.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt less than anyone else for his sexual desire
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less than others about his sexual orientation, but that it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete didn't realize that everyone was different until he went to high school.
When she was on the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others a chance.
She also said that she was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The longtime host of the show was on sick leave.
As the main guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt less comfortable than other teenagers because it was not as well received by society as the relationship between boys and girls.
He said that feeling really inferior and different was the driving force behind success.
He wanted to prove himself, but when others learned about his sexual orientation, he didn't want to disappoint them.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and called for homosexuality not to be criminalized at the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said this to show that he had a way to live openly without being persecuted and to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion American director Dustin Lance Black fell in love with the man he met in 2013.
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than her, but she says the age difference never caused any problems.
After having been through so much in your youth, it's hard to find a partner who has had such highs and lows". She attended her first Olympics when she was 14 years old, and her father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June, naming their son Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Dailey says his perspective has changed.
If you had asked me anything last year, I would have told you about the gold medal, she said.
You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold.
For me , the Olympic gold medal  Robby.
Her son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
One of the last things he asked for was a ticket to the London 2012 Olympics, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him that you wouldn't be in the front row with my father.
"I held his hand until he breathed his last, but the moment he died, I knew he was an undefeated winner".
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I realized that diving in my own arena during the Olympics was a dream of my life, a feeling I had never experienced before", she said.
And that's what led her to choose her first song, Proud by Heather Small, which was a song that stuck with her when she was preparing for the Olympics, and it still resonates with her when she listens to it.
The discs of the island without a country will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 AM.
Mickelson , without form , on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will be recording his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he needs to change his form to avoid this unfavorable outcome.
In his 12th appearance at the two-year tournament, Mickelson led the team in scoring with four goals and four assists on Saturday to replace Captain Jim Furrick.
Instead of being at the center of the story as in the United States, the five-time big winner spent this important day as a fan and working on his game on the field to correct the pitfalls that plagued him.
At the height of his career, the 48-year-old, who had never competed in a straight race, was not as flexible as the hard course of the Le Golf National, which was completely destroyed by the long and rigid support itself.
And if their pace isn't too scary, then Mickelson will go out on Sunday to meet the eventual British Open winner Francesco Molinari in his ninth match, which he will be joining with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans lose four points in 12 single games to start the game strong, then Mickelson's game could be the deciding game.
Furich expressed his confidence in his man, and he said nothing else.
He fully understood his role today, and he hugged me and kissed me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,  said Furyk.
He's too confident.
He's the Hall of Fame, and he's contributed a lot to the game for these teams, both back in the day and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games in a row.
I've been thinking a lot, but that's how it's designed, so we thought we should keep doing that.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson broke Nick Faldon's record for most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his personal record levels.
Mickelson's contribution to the team was 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation brought significant changes to the team.
He's a funny, sarcastic, thoughtful, mocking guy, and he's a great guy for our team, he said.
I think it was fun for young players to play with him this week, and we enjoyed it too.
He's got a lot to give beyond the game".
According to European captain Thomas Björn , the priority among the participants may soon be eliminated
The European captain Thomas Björn himself knew that a significant leadership in individual versions of the Ryder Cup could easily turn into a bad trip.
The Danish athlete had started his journey with the 1997 Valderram match, and, this time, the side led by Sev Ballesteros had outnumbered the Americans by five points, crossing the finish line with a head-to-head score of 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You're not afraid to say we had a great opportunity at Walderram, but we had a great opportunity in Brooklyn, but we won and we won fairly at Walderram", Bjorn said when the class of 2018 won 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
This is not the end, but the time will tell.
You're leaving tomorrow.
So do everything right.
It means the game is over until you have your points written on the board.
Our goal is to try and capture this loot and that's the goal that will be our primary focus.
I used to say that I was focused on my 12 games, but as we all know, the opponents are the strongest players in the world".
Bjorn, who was grateful for his players' hard-fought game, said: "I would never have been more self-absorbed.
Tomorrow's game is tomorrow night.
Tomorrow, the players go out individually and it's a different story.
It's a joy to have a partner to share your joy with when you're playing well, but when you're alone, you're trying to make a difference.
And this is what I command you to do, and I command you to tell the players, that they do not go out until the morning of the game, when they are able to do so.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he's trying to build on his potential".
Jim Furrick, the opponent's number one, compared to Björn, would look for players who performed better in individual games than their partner, certainly not including Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three of the four points given.
Furyk was himself at the head of both of the big rounds of that last day and played as part of the winning team in Brooklyn until his defeat in the European-organised "Wonder at the Medina".
"I still remember every word of the curse that was said about it", he said, responding to a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw united the players on the last day of the 1999 season.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start it as fast as we did in Brooklyn, Medina.
A shift in momentum would put a lot of pressure on the interim matches.
And with that in mind, we've changed the order of the players and we're going to do something amazing tomorrow".
It was Thomas's job to try and manage the fight, and he was to meet Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, Jan Polter and Rory McKillra in a top-flight match with other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went out with these guys in that order, because I think they can completely surround the road in that order", Björn said during the individual selection.
New German warship postponed again
In order to replace the near-aging warships used during the Qurtz-Kabaq war, the latest type of frigate of the German fleet was put into service in 2014, however, according to local media, they will not be delivered until at least the following year due to faulty systems and delivery costs.
The commissioning of the main vessel of the new line of battleships "Rhineland-Pfalz" in the Baden-Württemberg waterway has been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing information provided by a military representative.
The ship was to be delivered to the fleet in 2014, however, the dangerous issues that arose after the ship was delivered influenced the fate of the high-end project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 were to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have powerful flares, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as invisible technologies such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions can be attributed to the length of the validity period, i.e. the possibility of supplying the latest type of frigates sent from inland ports for up to two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were supposed to allow Germany to project electricity abroad, will become obsolete before they are put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The incident was reportedly in the news when the disorderly F125 frigate officially refused to commission the ship by the German Navy last year and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was unprecedented for the fleet to return a ship to its builder after the ship was delivered.
Although there is no complete information on the reasons for the return of the ship, the German media reported a number of significant "programming and device failures" that render the warship inoperable during combat missions.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships were equipped with a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to be overweight, meaning that excess weight would reduce the ship's performance and limit the possibility of further improvements by the Navy in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Pfalz was considered twice as heavy as the ships of this type used by the Germans during World War II.
The total cost of this project, including the cost of training the team, is also a controversial issue, except for the equipment failure.
He said that it reached an impressive level, from the initial 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros (3,6 billion dollars).
After the warnings of Germany about the reductions in the naval force, the issue of capturing new frigates is of great importance today.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliament's Committee on Defence, Hans-Peter Bartels, said that "the number of ships in service belonging to the navy is close to being exhausted".
The issue was further complicated by the fact that the old ships were taken out of service and replaced by the new ones.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had yet to be delivered to the fleet.
National Trust secretly listens to the secret life of advertisements
A new study on land ownership in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at showing how the brook can use the landscape to find food.
We hope that this data will help us to look at the behavior of the separate mammals from a new perspective and protect them in the future.
Research by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will further explore the common and soprano pipistrello, as well as the brown long-horned sparkling beetle and the Daubenton sparkling beetle in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed on the main premises of the hotel to monitor the activity of the bells throughout the period.
In addition, NHS staff and volunteers will conduct mobile screening with handheld detectors.
The sound analysis of all records determines the frequency of calls of the broadcasts and what type of broadcasts they are.
A map and a report of the habitat are then made to give full information about their activity on the landscape.
Rob Dwyer, a conservation advisor at NTS, said he hoped the results of the study would show which habitat is suitable for the lights and which species use them.
This information will help to determine the effectiveness of the work being done to monitor the habitat, such as ways of maintaining forest wires for bushes and similar animals.
The population of the sparrow in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the past hundred years.
Construction and development work is hampering their survival and threatening to destroy their habitat.
They may also be threatened by wind turbines and lighting, chemical processing of adhesives and building materials, and attacks by house cats.
In fact, the bright ones are not blind.
But when it comes to finding food, the eye is more important to them than the ear, for it is in the darkness that they hunt.
During flight, they use a sophisticated eco-location method to accurately identify hazards and obstacles on their routes.
The NTS organization, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land on the territory of the country, takes the issue of the blasts with great responsibility.
There are ten specialised experts who work there and who regularly conduct surveys, inspect the area and sometimes even rescue.
The organisation even opened a special stockpile of stamps for the first time in Scotland on the Trev estate in Dumfries and Galloway, and eight out of ten Scottish stamps are still living here.
According to real estate manager David Thompson, this is a very convenient place for land owners.
"Here, in Treve, there are some great places for the bright", he said.
"We have old buildings, many veterans, and a very comfortable environment to live in.
But there is still a lot of unknown data about the ads, so the work that is being done in these and other areas will help us better understand what is needed to increase them".
He stressed the importance of checking for lightning in the given area before starting the renovation work in the buildings, as the careless breakdown of one cell can cause damage to about 400 small lightning strikes and puppies, which make up the local population.
The animals are protected and killing, touching or breaking their nest is illegal.
The Charter was issued by the Scottish officer Elizabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Tress of Defence, who asked the crowd for help.
He said, "We know very little about our own species, and we know very little about the populations of some of them".
Ronaldo has denied the rape claim because his defendants are planning to sue him for the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the allegations of rape as "false information", and people have said they use his name to "show off their names".
His defendants are planning to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In an effort to keep the incident from being exposed, he paid her $375,000, Der Spiegel said in a statement on Friday.
A few hours after receiving the protest message, 33-year-old Ronaldo said in a video on Instagram that the message was "false information" in front of 142 million subscribers.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
They are telling lies today", said the five-time Golden Globe winner.
"They want to use my name to make their names.
This is normal.
They want to make a name for themselves by calling my name, which is their job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's defenders are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they described as "an unforgivable report on suspicion of privacy".
According to defender Christian Schertz, the player will be entitled to compensation "in proportion to the amount of moral damage caused, which has become one of the most severe forms of personal rights violations in recent years".
According to reports, the incident occurred in June 2009 in a hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada indicate that after a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room where he allegedly raped her.
According to Majorga, after the significant incident, Ronaldo leaned down and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and only "falled to one percent".
According to Ronaldo, the couple had sexual relations by mutual consent, as indicated in the documents.
According to Majorga, she filed a police complaint and photographed her injuries in hospital, but later decided to settle the matter out of court for fear of "disgrace" and "public embarrassment".
If we believe the words of the 34-year-old woman, she is still suffering from the impact of the incident, so she refuses to stand.
The incident is believed to have occurred when Ronaldo was transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he signed a €100 million contract with the Italian side Юве.
Brexit: UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers for life
According to the Minister of Commerce, Greg Clark, if the UK loses its status as a world leader in automotive production after Brexit, it will "regret for life".
He added that this was a "mistake" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily suspend its plant in Bernaston near Derby if the UK left the EU without a contract.
"We need to get a contract", Mr. Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, the consequences of the Brexit inaction on the border could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, and 90% of them were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the European Union by the end of March, we will see production at our factory stopped", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's executive director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed their concern about leaving the European Union without a contract for cross-border trade services.
For example, BMW announced that it would close its mines in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
According to the automakers, the main risk is the risk of a supply chain that is not related to Brexit.
Toyota's production line is implemented "in a timely manner" and auto parts are delivered every 37 minutes with the help of UK and EU suppliers.
According to experts in the field, if the UK leaves the EU without a contract on March 29, there may be delays and car parts shortages at the border.
The company claims that Toyota cannot keep its stock in its Derbyshire factory for more than a day, and that's the reason for the shutdown.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the European Union was "to the fullest extent possible designed to prevent such border checks".
"We need a contract, and I think we need a good contract that not only makes us successful right now, but also allows us to make the most of this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers are certified  the ability to continue the process that has been a very successful combination of supply chains so far".
Toyota did not say how long production would be halted, but cautioned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant in the future, ultimately leading to job cuts.
Peter Tswallaris, who worked for 24 years at Bernaston and was a member of Unite's factory staff, expressed concern about the union's membership: "I have seen from my own experience that these jobs will not reopen once they are closed.
In this regard, the Government spokesperson said: "We have presented a concrete and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union".
White House says Trump and Rosenstein may meet again
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed for another week", because Brett Kavanaugh's fight for election to the Supreme Court is still ongoing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who deals with issues such as Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump and Russian aides, and the President's possible obstacles to a fair trial.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General and, therefore, whether it will threaten the independence of the Muellers has been the subject of much debate in Washington over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein proposed using a recording line during a meeting with Trump and spoke about the possibility of removing the President from office with the help of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused to confirm this.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House and announced his retirement.
As a result, due to Trump's visit to the United Nations in New York, his meeting with Trump was postponed to Thursday.
Trump said he "does not want to release Rosenstein from his position", but the meeting was postponed again to avoid being interrupted by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was attended by Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump instructed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the Kavanaugh case, delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "The date is not yet known, perhaps this week will be delayed - I would like to say that the forecast may be withdrawn another week later, given other events in the Supreme Court.
We'll see about that again, but I want the press to know".
Some journalists said they disagreed with this view: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
And the driver, Chris Wallace, asked me why.
Sanders said the reason for the seldom organized press conference was not a "pity" for the community of television reporters, but he said: "I have no objection to their holding the position".
And then he suggested a direct link between Trump and the press.
"The President is conducting more question and answer sessions than before", he said, without providing any concrete evidence.
Sanders said that press conferences would continue to be held as they were, but that "if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be more important than talking to me.
"We're trying to do this more often, and you're seeing how we've been doing over the past few weeks, and your conversation with the President of the United States can replace a press briefing".
Trump will answer all questions regularly while leaving the White House or during open sessions and press conferences for senior officials.
Special press conferences are rarely organized.
This week in New York, the president has been complaining about why he is so neutral and sometimes so different in front of a gathering of journalists.
Minister of Health and Safety warned EU workers in Scotland about Brexit
The Minister of Health and Social Care thanked the EU workers in Scotland on behalf of the country and wished them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent this letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has taken on the costs of the applications for residence of citizens of the European Union in the public service.
Ms Freeman said in her letter: "The negotiations on the partition between the UK and the European Union continued throughout the summer and the final decision was almost reached by autumn.
However, the UK Government is also preparing for a no-contracts scenario.
I understand that this is a very stressful time for you.
So I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the work of every worker and whether or not they are divided by their nationality.
Partners from outside the European Union and beyond bring us valuable experiences and skills that will improve and develop healthcare services, and also benefit patients and organizations we serve.
Scotland is your home too, and we want you to stay here".
Christie Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery due to head injury
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee, Tennessee Trail Blazers quarterback Christie Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery for a head injury sustained during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident occurred shortly before the break.
"He went out to the edge and there he recognized himself", said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff put Abercrombie in a crib and sent him extra oxygen to the edge of the field before taking him for examination.
Chris Harris, a WSMV Nashville, Tennessee spokesman, said Abercrombie had just been released from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"There is no information on the extent or extent of the injury at this time", Harris added, while the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
This was the first season for the red-shirt sophomore, Abercrombie, since moving from Illinois to Tennessee.
By the time he left the game on Saturday, he had scored five complete runs, which would have brought his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will pay more on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the purchase of real estate
Foreign buyers will pay more on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan , and the proceeds will be used to help homeless people under the Tory plan
This move neutralizes Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to him.
The increased flag fee will be levied on tax-exempt individuals and organizations on the territory of the United Kingdom.
In order to help the poor , the result of this decision is planned to reach 120 million pounds per year in the treasury
Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will pay more in the case of real estate purchases in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless.
This move is an attempt by Jeremy Corbyn to neutralise his efforts to attract young voters by speaking out about the desire for affordable housing and higher wages.
The increased flag fee will be levied on tax-exempt individuals and organizations in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to combat insomnia by the Government.
The amount of surcharge added to the current flag fee is not less than three percent when calculating the high level of taxes and duties two years ago.
The decision is expected to generate up to £120 million a year in cash.
The data shows that 13 percent of London's real estate is owned by non-British sellers, and this has a direct effect on the price increase, reducing the chances of new sellers climbing the housing ladder.
Many potential regions of the country, especially the capital, have become "shared cities" due to the increase in foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
A new policy was born just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the flag tax to help most young people buy their first homes.
He accused large construction firms of owning land but failing to allow them to lower real estate prices by not using it, and urged Queen May to decline a quota of affordable housing to remove the "disgrace in residential construction" in Britain.
Mr. Korbin said that he proposed several attractive housing reforms, such as controlling the cost of renting and evicting the house without any reason.
He also said that he wanted to give the representation more power to build new houses.
Mrs May says, "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to the fulfillment of the British dream, to improve the lives of future generations.
This means that we have to repair the collapsed housing market.
The door to Britain is always open to those who want to live, work and live here.
But I think it's not fair for people who don't live in the UK and foreign companies to have easier access to housing than hardworking British people.
For many, having a home is a dream come true, and the lack of sleep is too much to ask for".
Jack Ross said: My main goal is to govern Scotland
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, said his "main goal" was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old will enjoy the revival of the northeast club, which is third in the Scottish First League with a three-point margin.
After sending Saint-Myrène to the Premier League last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap, and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching the game with my dad in Hampden, Scotland, when I was a kid, and that was the reason I came back.
If I succeed in running the club, I will have that opportunity".
Before Russia, people such as Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardides, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were Sunderland managers.
Alloa Athletic's former manager, who had not previously accepted the overtures of Barnsley and Ipswich Town, was never disappointed that he would continue to follow such prominent figures at such a large club.
The question of whether I can get the club back to the Premier League determines whether I have succeeded at the moment".
He said that the club's structure and facilities were linked to the fact that it was definitely part of the Premier League.
"It's not easy to get into it, but if I can get the club back to him, I'm probably just seeing that I can be successful here".
Ross began his managerial career just three years ago after working as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and then as one of Harts' coaching staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa to promotion back to the third tier, and made the outstanding St Mirren club the championship winner in the following season.
Ross said he was more comfortable than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He said that he felt that he was really on the sidelines.
"I really thought that the control would be more relevant than the play.
And that sounds interesting, because I did my job well, I made good money, and I got a lot of good results.
But it can be difficult to play.
We need to get some work done in a week.
I'm going through the complexities of the job, but the management is just getting started.
I've always wanted to be a leader, and I've found the most comfortable place in my adult life".

Studies show that the best time to eat pizza is around 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summertime was a success for competing British pubs, but it had a negative impact on the restaurant chain.
According to statistics, pubs and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but orders in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA Business Advisor who produced the indicators, said: "The fact that the weather is hot and England's participation in the World Cup is longer than expected means that the trend will continue in July, when pubs' profits are 2.8 percent and the restaurant losses are higher than ever.
The situation of the restaurants, which had a decrease in their profits by 1.8 percent in the season, would be worse than ever.
Pubs and bars are more in demand than restaurants.
Pubs that serve food are also more prone to damage in hot weather, but not in the same difficult conditions as restaurants.
It's like people just come out of their homes to drink water.
While the sales of wine in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent in one month, the sales of food decreased by three percent".
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and hospitality analyst, said: "These results will continue the trend that has been going on since April.
When it comes to sales on the outdoor market, the impact of weather and social or sporting events remains the biggest factors.
The restaurant groups will certainly continue to struggle, but a 4.8% drop in sales in the annual report, especially due to price pressure, will be a big blow.
The long hot summer has become the worst time for food industry, and whether or not the average temperature in August is a low-pressure summer is time".
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, increased by 2.7 percent in July, slowing the emergence of brands.
For the British pub, bar and restaurant sector, Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales monitoring service, collects and analyzes production data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of £9 billion and is considered a recognised industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has a social network account that they keep from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children (some of them young children as young as 11) has a secret social network account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake Insta pages increased
There is a great doubt about the making of sexual notes
Twenty percent of students have a basic accounting record of their parents
One in five children (some of them young children as young as 11) create a social network account that keeps them hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students found that the number of fake Insta pages increased.
There is a great deal of doubt about whether sexual records are being made.
Twenty percent of students have a basic accounting record that they provide to their parents, and they also keep secret accounts.
A mother who was caught up in the secret activity of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager begging others to rape her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Director's Conference found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, one of which is kept secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Elide Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eliddoyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Council.
Doyle  is the most awarded athlete and chairman Jan Beatty described this step as a great opportunity for the sports management to use his rich experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elyde is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and international community and we think Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from his appointment to the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I try to be the voice of athletes and I hope to help develop and direct the sport in Scotland".
Among the four Olympic gold medals, the winner of the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, an American citizen who is now a regular BBC scientist, was unable to walk on his own after an ischemia attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that time will tell me how much I want to be or not.
It was hard work, but I got my full body, I learned to walk again, and now I'm working out!
Thank you for your supporting messages".
Comparing women to cows in a breast pump advertisement has generated mixed reviews
The advertisement of a breast pump company comparing nursing mothers to breastfeeding cows has generated mixed reviews online.
Consumer technology company Elvie has released a video of a wildly popular advertisement to show the freedom that mothers have to give in order to announce the release of what is known as the world's first wearable silent breast pad.
Four mothers in a basket of grass are dancing to this song: "Yes, I bite myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't notice that this isn't wind, then this is my breast".
And the chorus said, I will draw forth, and I will draw forth; and I will feed the children, and I will heal the women.
However, the company's Facebook advert caused controversy on the network.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of reviews, has received mixed reviews from viewers, many of whom said it exposes the dairy industry's shameful views.
"It was a very wrong decision to use cows to promote this product.
They will be like us in childbirth and milk, and in the days to come they will be taken away.

Another commentary says: "It is obvious that it is harmful to both mother and child.
But why not use it to announce breastfeeding to mothers who want to hold their baby?"
Another commenter added, "It's irrelevant advertising".
While others were supporting the ad, one woman found the song entertaining.
 I think this is a great idea.
If I were a sucker, I would take one of these.
And when I used the milkshake, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement was a little silly, but I took it as it was.
It is a fruit that cannot be obtained".
Another commented: This ridiculous ad is for mothers who use milk thistles (mostly at work or in the bathroom) and who feel like siir.
This is not a promotion to undermine or degrade the status of dairy farming.
At the end of the scene, a group of women are shown dancing with their breasts covered in milkweed.
The concept of this ad is based on the idea that many women who use milk thistle feel like cows.
But the nurse is silent, and there is no cord or pipe; and she is light in the breast of the nurse, and she is free to go forth into the field, to hold the child, and to nurse.
According to our colleague and expert on early development of breast milk, Ana Balarin, Elvi milk is such a revolutionary product, its introduction to the market should be bold and thought-provoking.
By showing the parallels between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on the challenges of using milk and the challenges associated with it, while also providing a relaxing and comparatively relaxing sense of freedom that the new breastmilk gives us.
This isn't the first time that Elvie has been the main subject of the breastfeeding program.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two went to the podium during a performance by designer Martha Yakubovsky using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly from tents to camps along the Texas border.
While the monthly number of border crossers has not changed, the number of migrant children held has increased dramatically, because at times, the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsorship.
Most of them are undocumented immigrants who do not want to lose their opportunity to stay in the country by claiming a child.
The Federal Administration announced in June that potential sponsors and other minor citizens living in their homes are obliged to submit fingerprints and that the information will be sent to the Migration Administration.
Last week, senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albens, testified before Congress that the agency has taken dozens of people who have applied for sponsorship of minors who have lost their care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been convicted before.
 Nearly 80 percent of people who are members of the household of sponsors or sponsors are illegal in the country and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal involvement.
We will continue to persecute these people, " Mr. Albenz said.
To speed up the work with children, the authorities introduced new rules, which, according to the camp staff, require that some people appear in court within a month, not 60 days after their previous detention.
In addition, the majority of people will be able to make their applications to the Immigration Judge by phone via videoconference, in order to legalize their cases.
Anyone deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
Based on the camp staff and the reports made in the system in recent months, the longer children stay on defense, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to further violence or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that in large institutions like Tornillo, these issues are increasing because in such a large area, the child abuse may be neglected.
They said moving children to a tented town without emotional preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate a psychological disaster that most people can't get rid of.
Syria is demanding the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish troops
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the eight-year war in the country.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Muallem, the fact that foreign troops are illegal on Syrian soil is considered in a proper way, referring to the war against terrorism.
They should leave the country without delay, regardless of any circumstances", he said.
Muallem said that the war against terrorism in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011, is over.
He said that the holy battle will not end until Damascus clears all Syria from any illegal foreign occupation, including terrorist groups.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly training and training Kurds and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said that the situation for their return was favorable and that the reason for the displacement of refugees was that Western countries were spreading irrational fear.
We urged the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to the return of refugees to their countries", he said.
They turned the clean social issue into politics.
The United States and the European Union warn that no aid will be provided to rebuild Syria unless an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition in the country to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed for the continuation of political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a massive invasion of the three million-member area by Russian-backed Syrian troops.
The Minister also stressed that the agreement has a specific term and hoped that military actions will be directed towards jihadists, including Nusra Front, which has ties to al-Qaeda.
The UN representative, Stefan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, to prepare the post-war constitution of Syria and open the election path.
Muallem made the arrangements for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee's work, noting that the working group should be limited to revising the current constitution, and cautioned against going further.
Why would Trump win a second term?
According to this logic, Mr. Trump could have been re-elected in 2020 if his impeachment and disputes had not ended before his term as president, as many liberal observers hope.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of the presidential term ever!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million, and tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Nielsen said Fox News has 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to an average of 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's Rachel Maddow has surpassed the rating of cable systems with 3.5 million viewers watching the mainstream evening news.

And of course, other than anything on television, a Washington DC story line could determine the future of Roy B. Wade, can immigrant families get together and does it affect the state of the global economy?

For six hours, he discussed the "Fear of the Dark" in Bob Woodward's book, "Fear of the Dark", and viewed Paul Manafort's $15,000 straw leather jacket (according to the Washington Post, "a fat-clothed dress"), as well as Storm Daniels' furious description of Trump's anatomy, going beyond the limits of being a citizen with information.

The outward cash flow is directed to the strict election procedures of the White House during the most busy hours.
With the reorganization of congressional districts, and the two candidates for the same seat in the race, it's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving financial aid.
The recently rebuilt Pittsburgh desirability zones will undoubtedly hinder the Democratic candidate, Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another special district last spring.
Lamb is running for office with Republican Kate Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th District, which is now surrounded by Pennsylvania's new 17th District.
The maps were re-issued after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that Republicans had unconstitutionally taken over the old territories.
The race in the new 17th District, led by the Democratic Campaign's Congress Committee (DNC) and the Republicans National Campaign Committee (RNC), caused funding to decline among the funding groups of the parties.
After a small victory in the March special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania.
The seat has been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won it by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats little priority.
US has later eased sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing with little opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump attended a warm-up meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization management team.
In accordance with the ruling to no longer recognize Taiwan, officials of the State Department have taken the decision to withdraw American diplomatic officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, the press secretary of the department, Heather Nauert, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the fines were only applied against El Salvador in 2017, which received $140 million in U.S. aid to restrict drug use, develop the country and provide economic support.
The proposed fines, reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, unemployment and high rates of homicide will undoubtedly have a serious impact on the Central American country.
In the course of the internal meetings, leaders of North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to hold exactly the same meeting, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States last year.
However, by mid-September, senior leaders had fully supported holding the conference ahead of time, and as a result, they wanted the fines imposed on El Salvador to be lifted.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence intends to discuss the introduction of seats for the administrative meeting in mid-October.
Only three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic peacefully without any severe warnings or sanctions from Washington.
White House Speaker Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussions described by three American diplomats, including two diplomats, and they stopped discussing anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external expert close to the administration, who also spoke about anonymity.
Researching the history
And the next step is a report by special counsel Robert Mueller about Trump's obstruction of justice, which has a lot of evidence that is now public.
Mr. Mueller reportedly turned his research to the question of whether Trump's election campaign and Russia had a clandestine agreement to influence our election.
If Congress goes from one hand to the other, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that organization because he's prepared to go back to the electorate, and eventually to the House of Lords.
There's a lot of egger here, but I'm not saying that Trump or Europeans like him will definitely lose.
Our choices on both sides of the Atlantic determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, when Western countries opposed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler.
We missed the benefits and the long-term risk of blood clots.
History is developing around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either reviving or dying.
Americans are currently experiencing some of these change points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who was responsible for Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since the newspaper offered to videotape the president in secret last year and announced his ineptitude for the presidency, Rosenstein has been in trouble.
Rosenstein said that the information provided by The Times was not accurate.
If the newly appointed FBI's investigation into Brett Kavanagh is not complete or fair, or despite evidence of sexual assault and false testimony, if the Supreme Court confirms it, how will we respond?
And first of all, in the midterm elections, will we vote for the Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will be asleep for a long time.
But I hope that we will not be disappointed by the lessons learned from what happened in Prague.
My mother, a Czechoslovak Jew, was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who had seized my embassy.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to that table with a swastika to light the lamps on Sabbath.

Ranger Graham Dorrance is optimistic about the conflict in Vienna.
The Rangers hosted the Vienna Cup on Thursday, and after a fantastic game against Villarreal earlier this month, the victory over the Austrians secured them a strong place in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorran was unable to take the field for the first time this season with a 2-2 record with Villarreal, but he said he hoped the Rangers would use the results as a great success trampoline.
"It was a good experience for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
"We went out with confidence that we would not lose the game and we got a point".
I believe that the result of the game was fair, even though we broke the rules of the game in the end.
They played better in the first half of the game, but in the second half of the game, we seemed to have a better result.
If we go back to Thursday, it's a very important night for Europe.
I hope we get three points, but it seems difficult for us because they did a good job in the first game, but with the support of the fans who trust us, I'm sure we'll keep going and we'll do a good job.
And I'm sure that last year was a tough one for me, because it's a lot to do with my injury and the changes at the club, but I also have to remember that I feel good about being here.
The team is in good shape, the boys are getting only positive feedback, and the training is also good.
I hope we can put the past season behind us and move forward and succeed.
Women lose sleep due to fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, several people spoke to family members about it.
Nearly half of the people surveyed nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company, "People want the care of their family members, but they are not taking steps to talk about it with each other".
We have to start here.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for themselves without making a decision.
You need to talk to your counselor and your family about where and how to get care, because these decisions are important factors in determining the price.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor may find a way to make payments.
Your choice of long-term care financing is a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps pay for expenses, or if you have money, insurance yourself at your own expense.
For legal documents, please confirm: To avoid legal disputes, discuss everything at the venue.
Choose a health authority wherever you are, so that someone you trust can assess your level of care and ensure that the professionals are doing what you want (if you can't talk).
Please also note that a lawyer is needed when it comes to financial matters.
When you are incapacitated, you need to choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions and pay your expenses.
Remember the trivia: Imagine that one of your elderly parents is in an emergency and is now on his way to the hospital.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palau killed 384 people this Friday, and officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, the staff of the aid institutions could not receive any information from the Donggala region in the north of the city of Palú, near the epicenter of the 7.5 point earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster in Palud.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, at the end of a narrow strait, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami affected the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along a coastline of over 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the administrative district in the lower part of the province was 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel production is also important in the province, but the trade is mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Management, the tsunami has occurred several times in the past hundred years in Palo and Donggala.
In 1938, a tsunami swept through the Donggala region, killing more than 200 people and destroying hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismically active zone known as the "Fire Trench of the Pacific", and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred here in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on December 26 off the west coast of Aceh province, north of Sumatra Island, Indonesia, caused tsunamis in 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, several strong earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra Island.
And there died hundreds of men in the island of Nias, which is in the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern coast of Indonesia, killing about 700 people on the most densely populated island of Java.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred in Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-point earthquake on one of the Metavai Islands in Sumatra caused a 10-meter-long tsunami, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-level earthquake in the Pidi-Jay Regency of Aceh caused devastation and panic among the population, as people were warned about the 2004 massive earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from the collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily prevented thousands of tourists from returning home.
Sara Palin ' s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Trac Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police, which denied access to information about domestic violence.
According to the police, the woman took her phone when her acquaintance attempted to report alleged crimes to the police.
Paylin was placed in Mat-Sou's detention center, where he was held on $500 unsecured bonds, KTUU reported.
On the Sabbath he came to the court and demanded a confession. But the news spread that he was innocent.
Palin is charged with three Class A felonies, and he faces up to one year in prison or a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B felony and sentenced to one day in prison and a fine of $2000
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans' Council.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, providing false information and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
And his daughter smote him in the face, and she mourned against him.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans for linking her son's violent actions to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people died.
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that killed thousands of cows.
The number of people who have lost their lives due to the failure of electricity and communication networks is expected to continue to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck in the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on social media that capture the moment of impact.
As soon as the tsunami reached the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palau.
Federal prosecutor ' s office seeks a rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is considering a rare death sentence for Syphollo Saypov, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare death sentence that has not been used in the state since 1953 against federal crime.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov rented a truck in a warehouse in lower Manhattan, along the West Side Highway, to attack pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov had committed a plot against eight victims and inflicted serious bodily injuries in connection with the document on the death penalty in the southern region of New York.
According to the court documentation, the death penalty can be imposed in two cases.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal jury convicted Saipov of 22 categories of charges, including eight murders, which federal prosecutors typically use for organized crime, violence and vehicular homicide.
Prosecutors said that the terrorist act required careful and pre-planned planning, describing the crime as "harmful, cruel and degrading".
"Saipov Saipullo Habibulayevich caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of citizens such as Diego Enrique Andjelini, Nikolasa Kleves, Anne-Lora Decadt, Darrena Drejka, Arielle Erlia, Erna Ferruchi, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the state side indicted.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last capital punishment case was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The final death sentence in a federal case in New York was imposed on the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. The couple were sentenced to death after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg's were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown that he did not regret the days and months following the terrorist act.
According to police, he told investigators that after doing so, he felt better.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that after seeing videos of ISIS on his mobile phone, he was inspired to act as a terrorist.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in a hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
One of the federal public defenders who defended Saipov's interests, David Patton, said he was "totally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our opinion, instead of being sentenced to death without a plea bargain, the death penalty will prolong the suffering of everyone involved", Patton said.
The group of Saipov's defenders asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory's government spokesman said Nigel Farage should be held accountable for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Faraj pledged to mobilize the Khazarian army during the protest today at the Tory Conference.
Former Ukip leader, politicians, said that they should feel the cold coming from the Euro-skeptics because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, thought that she should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative agent Peter Bonn said at the Birmingham March: "If the Secretary of the Brexit Party were Mr. Frackie, England would have left the EU by now".
However, the issue that Mrs. May raised with her deeply divided views was the Tory supporters' personal protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is doing everything he can to maintain the peace plan, and the attackers include those who want Brexit, those who want to stay in the Union and those who want the EU.
The unions are trying to negotiate with Brussels despite the negative reaction and demand that Eurosceptics and Labour make a choice between their own plan and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.
He made a conscious decision and suggested that he should be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he had been responsible for this, we would not be in this union now".
A member of the Wellingborough parliament added: "I am for Brexit, but we must put pressure on the Chickers".
He said: "We are not participating in world wars now to be subordinate to anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bon has not accepted any suggestions that public opinion has changed since 2016: the idea that the British people want to change their minds and stay in the Union is completely false.
Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and to the journalists: I just say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chickers are not attractive to the masses, the opposition does not vote for them, they are not popular with our party and activists who choose us, after they damage our streets.
Put down the chickens and listen.
In a letter to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers can only hold their seats when they are on their word.
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians who opposed the decision taken in the 2016 referendum wanted to betray, they would feel cold.
"Now it's about trust between the people and our political environment", he said.
They're trying to sell Brexit, and we're here to tell them, 'We're not going to let you go.
In a message to a group of people, he added: "I want our political environment to feel warm, which is on the side of betraying Brexit".
We will mobilize the people of this country that won the Brexit and we will not stop until Britain is an independent, self-governing, proud country.
At the same time, those who wanted to remain in the union passed through Birmingham and held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists launched the group this weekend, and then they pulled out the anti-Brexit banners Tori.
Lord Adoni, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservatives when they recalled the security issues raised at the opening of the conference.
These are the people who are building IT systems and saying that all the technology is ready for Canada, and that there is a possibility of free, borderless trade in Ireland", he said.
This is a very rude joke.
He added: "There is nothing better than Brexit".
Varren plans to show a strong stance in presidential candidacy
After the November US election, Senator Elizabeth also said she would consider running for president with pride.
According to the Boston Globe, a Democrat from Massachusetts will be speaking about his future in a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Deal, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign.
He was in the midst of speculation that he might succeed Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, after Trump took office, he had his 36th meeting with voters in the Holiota city format.
One of the participants asked him if he had any plans to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and restore power that didn't work properly, and that it meant that women should be in top leadership.
After the shooting death of Louisiana State University player Sims, the suspect was arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported that a suspect was arrested on Saturday for the shooting death of LMU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested at 11:00 a.m. ET news conference.
They posted a video of the shooting online on Thursday and asked for help identifying the person in the photo.
On Friday, Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University.
Media officials reported that Wade Sims was shot in the head and died, police chief Murphy J. Poole said on Sunday.
When Wadey stepped forward to protect his friend, Simpson shot him.
Simpson was investigated and admitted to being at the scene, using a weapon and riding Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
At Baton Rouge, the 6-foot-6 Sims started 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: After the defeat of Sebastian Fettel, Lewis Hamilton won the title of world champion.
As soon as Walter Bottas took over from Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was revealed that the Mercedes team would play a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas started a good game and drove Hamilton out of the game, defending his position in the first two corners and inviting Fettell to attack his colleague.
Fettell went into the pit first, and Hamilton was left to start the traffic at the end of the line, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes later turned the circle and left Fettel behind, but Hamilton took the lead after matching the wheels, forcing the driver to leave the interior space free, making two-speed movements to protect the third corner.
Max started the back row with West and finished seventh after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Then, while driving the majority of the race, Kimmy was trying to get past Raikkonen by holding her tires and getting into the top four.
In the 44th lap, he hit the holes and could not accelerate in the last eight laps, and he finished fourth to Riko.
It's a difficult day because Valterie did a great job every weekend and he missed me as a real gentleman.
And this is what the team did to shoot two rabbits with one bullet".
It was really bad body language .
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for taking a letter from Supreme Court candidate Christine Blaysey Ford accusing her of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not comment on the testimony given by Ford, saying that the events in the Senate in the middle of the Senate Judiciary Committee against him showed that people were liars, hypocrites, and unreliable.
"What you've been seeing in the Senate these past few days is that you see the faces of people, they're bad, they're hypocritical, they're liars", he said.
And if you look at the thugs and the thugs, they say, "Oh, I didn't do that".
"I didn't do this".
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, have you made it public?
Remember the answer... you made the document public -- oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
"I did not publish"
Okay, wait a minute.
We have not announced it", he said.
Feinstein received a full written letter from Ford in July about the charges against Kavanaugh, which was originally scheduled for early September, but Feinstein denied that the information was coming from his office.
"I'm not hiding, Doctor. Ford's conclusions, I'm not publishing his story", Feinstein told the committee.
And he told me to keep it secret; and I kept it secret, as he had said.
But his methodology didn't seem to appeal to the president who commented on the meeting Saturday night: "I thought you were really bad body language.
He may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The president continued to defend the candidacy of the man accused of sexual assault of three women to the Supreme Court, suggesting that the Democrats were using the accusation for their own purposes.
"They were determined to restore power by any means necessary.
"You see the greed and hypocrisy, it doesn't matter who they have to crush and crush to gain power and control", the president said, Mediaite reports.

Air traffic controller killed hundreds of people on board the plane on the way to rescue from the earthquake
Hundreds of people in Indonesia are being honoured for their heroic efforts to ensure the safe flight of a full-sized aircraft from the ground, and the air traffic controller who died later.
On Friday, after the tsunami caused by the massive earthquake on Sulawesi Island, more than 800 people died and many people were left unresponsive.
And the strong underground troops continued to destroy the region, and the city of Pallu was destroyed.
Despite the fact that his colleagues had refused to flee to save their lives, 21-year-old Antoninus Guanavan Agung refused to leave his job at the heavily-cluttered dispatch tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport in Palo.
He left to ensure that Baltic Air Flight 6321 could fly safely on the runway.
Then he jumped from the tower, thinking the traffic control tower was falling.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation Representative Johannes Seiret said the decision saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter to take him to a large hospital in the city, other than Balikpapan in Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we missed the helicopter until it reached Pallas.
"It is very hard for us to hear this".
Authorities also fear that the death toll could reach a thousand, as the country's natural disaster relief agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
The number of victims is still expected to increase, because many of the graves are still under the rubble, most of them cannot be reached", said Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the Sutopo Agency.
The waves, reaching a height of six meters, destroyed Palau, where a mass burial ceremony was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering aid and food supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Small shops are looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross helps survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
It's a tragedy, but it could have been worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the country's military, "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, the Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea has announced that one person has left unattended after the plane crash in the lagoon .
The airline, which operated the crashed flight in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, reported that one person has now disappeared without a trace, and all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sunken aircraft.
Air Niugini reported in a press release that in this case, on Saturday, it was not possible to count the passenger male.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said that seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers remained in hospital, and that all of them are in stable condition".
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remained unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had hijacked the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jones, said the plane was flying very low.
"This is a very good thing", said Jane.
Janees said that she and others had managed to get to the emergency exit doors by swimming in the plane that was sinking.
He said that the pilots were shouting and screaming, and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on improvements to the nearby dam helped rescue the plane by using a paddle boat until it sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Flight Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in air crashes involving airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them have anything to do with Air Niuigin.
Analyst published a nightly schedule of the burned woman
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case in Mississippi in 2014 over a man who set a woman on fire.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, has been an expert in the field of analyzing intelligence.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Clarion Ledger claimed that Rowlett had obtained location data from several cell phones, which revealed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, and that she contradicted Tellis' previous answers.
When the data showed that Chambers had his cell phone records, he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and the police went to Sanford to interview him.
Sanford testified that he was not in town on Saturday.
Since prosecutors claimed that Tellis Sanford was in a truck, prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth, and he replied, "He's lying, my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that at the time of Chambers' death, Tellis said she had known him for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, calls and contact information from her phone a few days after Chambers' death.
She's cut him off from her life".
The defense must begin the final evidence on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.

Is he black again?
A New York nanny sued a couple for a "violent" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a complaint from a parent that one of the parents was black.
The couple denies their racial identity, and they consider the claim to be a "discrimination".
Lindsay Placko-Flaxman, a mother of two, first came to work in 2016 when she learned that Giselle Morris, a newborn childcare provider, was of black descent.
"I am a very young, very young man", wrote Linssey Placko-Flacksman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, Morris sent her to Mrs.
According to the New York Post, Placo-Flaxman, feeling guilty, said that due to "unfairness", the African-American nanny had performed poorly, and that he was firing Ms. Morris and waiting for a Filipino instead.
Morris paid Mrs. Weber a day's wages and sent her to Uberman's house.
Now, Morris is filing a lawsuit to claim $350 compensation for a couple who hired him out of work for six months without a contract.
I wanted to show them that they can't do what they know they can do", he told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded against the charge of "racial" by stating that they could not trust Morris after the accusation and that it was a reasonable decision to dismiss him.
And she sent to him a message, which he would not say to him.
He is not racist.
We are not racist people", her husband, Joel Plasto, told The Post.
Wouldst thou give thy children to the hand of a man that hath done thee wrong?
A newborn baby?
Come with me".
The application was likened to a maternity leave, and Placo said that his wife had given birth to a baby just two months ago and that she was in a very difficult situation.
Would you go after such a situation?
This is not a good thing", the investment banker commented.
As the case went on, the court of public opinion was recording the pair for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers cited a new letter that readers were not taking a proper view of the talking bear.
About the letter, Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, says: "Before it was published, it was hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who had read it for the first time.
It's interesting to see what we know about Paddington's great success".
His father was inspired to write a children's book about a little toy bear, and he was notoriously optimistic about his work as a BBC operator, but he was also optimistic that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the books' release was a "bitter-tasting" victory.
Describing Paddington as a very important member of his family, his father said he was proud of his achievements.
"He was not arrogant, but very calm and humble", she said.
"But Paddington was so true to her, it was like you had a child and you were proud of her achievements even though it wasn't your job.
I think that's how he evaluated Paddington's success.
And even though it was his nature and imagination, he always respected himself".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, she was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked tirelessly to save her life.
"Ned kept calling me and saying that he felt bad and that he didn't want to do this", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperaz.
"Then Ned called me and told me he was going to die in two minutes, so I had to say goodbye to him.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my soul.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave him to treat a heart attack were slowly stopping working and leaving his body.
He had been dead before, and this was the last.
I knew that all this was true, so I had to wait there for a while.
I was surrounded by families and people, so I couldn't cry, cry, or whistle.
I really had to keep everything inside".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan LaPéraz, who had not accepted the hard trials she was going through, cried out for her daughter's loss and sat down with the other passengers on the plane.
"No one knows", he said.
"When I put my head down, tears came out of my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a special soul for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him".
Open letters of mourning from women for the prevention of suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to make sure others don't kill themselves and say goodbye to life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, where people can call for help.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he suffered from depression, and he was only 18 when he signed his hand.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said that her son had a great future as a cook.
"Everyone knew her smile.
They always said that her smile would light up any room".
But he had left his work before he died, because he was in the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother, after he quit his life, found his brother.
Mrs. Davis: "I'm always distracted by the effects of strikes".
Mrs. Davis created maps to let people know that there are people who can go and ask for help, even if they are friends.
Don't sit still - you need to talk to someone and get out of your mind".
Mrs. Humphries, who was friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say anything about his depression or his falling down", she said.
"A day or two before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
She was in the basement on Christmas Day, and the kids were opening their presents and she was staring at them".
She said that her death was a big blow to them, but they had to go through it and work, and she said, "This is destroying the family.
He's going to tear us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

As the FBI began its investigation, the fate of Brett Kavanagh was in doubt.
"I thought that if we could have a limited investigation, even if it was limited in time and volume, we would have been united", Flake said on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
It is only a matter of time before they are willing to come.
The midterm elections will be held just five weeks later on November 6 - if Republicans are as bad as expected, they will be severely weakened in their bid to nominate a candidate for the country's Supreme Court.
George Bush was working at the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary, and he called to support Kavanaugh, who was trying to influence the senators.
What happens when the FBI reports?
Currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would have allowed Vice President Mike Pence to be dismissed and his candidacy for the Supreme Court to be confirmed.
During Kim's reign, the number of refugees in North Korea declined.
The number of North Korean refugees arriving in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korea's legislature said.
PakBeng-Segu, citing the data of the Ministry of Southern Cooperation, said that compared to 2706 in 2011, there were 1127 refugees last year.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China and the high rates of smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the North Korean immigrants are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that after the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Korean citizens crossed the border illegally.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea - it is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats migrants as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks.
This was the case when US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore in June, when they agreed to work on the Korean Peninsula's nuclear nonproliferation agreement under common terms.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yun-ho accused the United States of not making any progress in sanctions since then.
"When there is no confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such cases, we will not allow unilateral disarmament", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh isteriчный, who she considers unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh isteriчный and said he was completely unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
If I ever want her to do this, they're going to think, "Pelosi said about Kavanaugh's response to the witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Dr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations of sexual assault when she and Christine Blazey Ford were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was sometimes shouting and confused when he talked about his family and his high school years at his opening ceremony.
He also openly condemned Democrats on the committee who accused democracy of being a "grotesque and coordinated killing" organized by the liberal Democrats who lost the 2016 presidential election to Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi Kavanaugh's testimony convinced him that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he was anti-Democratic.
I don't think he knows how he's doing with these concepts and after the Clintons and Democrats", he said.
Pelosi will demonstrate whether he will try to implement Kavanaugh if it is confirmed, if the Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives.
I will say this - if he hasn't told the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he should not only go to the Supreme Court, he should be in court now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in DC at the Court of Appeals.
As a Pelosi democracy, it is considered to be a conservative justice against the decisions of the Kavanaugh potential anti-law Available Care Law or Ро - Wade.
Kavanaugh, during his confirmation hearing, asked if he would violate some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
It's not the time for a hysterical, fake person to go to court and we're like,  not great , "he says.
And women should use it.
It is a just diet, the splash of months and years, and it cannot be mourned.
We cry when we're angry, "Mrs. Stainem told me 45 years later.
I think this is not uncommon?
And he said unto me, When he was angry with me, he was weeping; and when he was angry, he wept, and said to him that talked with him, I am sad, for I am weeping.
My phone is open. 
And he continued.
And then I think it was good.
The tears of anger are half-out of the eyes, because they do not understand it properly.
One of the most memorable memories of my early work in a man-owned office is when I was crying from a sense of anger, when an old woman, who I was always afraid of, held me by the cold hand of a manager and dragged me down the stairs.
And he said unto me, Let not thy weeping be seen in the sight of them.
They don't know you're a dog.
They think you're in a bad mood and they're happy you're in.
Patricia Schrader, then a congressional Democrat from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential race.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called the "Mother Business" for unmarried relationships and dropped out of the race.
It was a thoughtless decision,  he remembered with laughter after 30 years.
And there were seven other candidates, and they needed one.
Another called it Snow White and Seven Projects.
Because he was late for the campaign, he was out of the fundraiser, so he said he wouldn't run until he had raised $2 million.
He was losing the fight.
He realized that his supporters who wanted to give him $1,000 could have given him $250.
"Do you think I was being relieved? " I asked.
When she announced that she would not run an official campaign, she was filled with emotion, thanking those who supported her, and disappointed not with the anger at sexism that had choked her, but with the system that had made it difficult to raise funds and target voters.
If you think about how much I was nervous,  Mrs. Schröder remembered how the press had affected her.
"When Kleenex became my corporate sponsor.
I remembered what they were going to put in my grave.
Is she crying?
What benefits could a trade war between the United States and China bring to Beijing?
While the start of the trade war between the United States and China shocked the world, it is unlikely that it will end anytime soon, experts say that a prolonged division between these countries could be beneficial to Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing China's most important export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The price increase has been boosted this week by new tariffs that have affected goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which means that half of all goods imported from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken similar measures, such as the last time it imposed a tax of five to ten percent on US goods worth 60 billion US dollars in response to the US's tough tariffs.
China has promised to compete with the United States, but the star of the world's second largest economy doesn't seem to be shining anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw would cause unsatisfactory demands, but a move to the United States would be extremely uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if the US pressures continue for a long time, Beijing will play its cards correctly, which could have a positive impact on China by weakening its economic interdependence.
 An urgent political decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to a crisis in the economy of any of these countries, which is far more dangerous than external observers have predicted    said Abigail Grace  researcher at the Center for Asian Experts at New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to return refugees
Syria said it was only willing to return returning refugees and asked for help to rebuild the country, which had been ravaged by war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister  Walid al-Muallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the country has become stable and secure.  He said.
The government continues to work on the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the riots.
Currently, all conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at the daily life and livelihoods of the population.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said that the Syrian regime will welcome those who help rebuild the country that has been ravaged by rebellion.
However, he noted that he would not receive assistance from countries that help by signing treaties or supporting the uprisings.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team by 16.5-10.5 in the final at the Le Golf National Stadium outside Paris, France.
The US team has lost the Ryder Cup for the sixth time since 1993 in Europe.
The Danish team, led by captain Thomas Björn, had recovered the European crown when they scored 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The US front-runner Phil Mickelson performed well throughout the tournament, and he hit the ball in the 16th hole of the 3rd leg, thus handing the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all rounds, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record in the current format of the tournament, which was established in 1979.
American Jordan Spit scored 5&4 against the lowest ranked Danish Torbjörn Olesen in the European team.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to England's Ian Polter, who may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
Sergio Garcia, a seven-time Spanish Ryder Cup veteran, won the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
"I usually don't want to cry, but I can't help myself today.
It was a very difficult year.
I'm thankful for Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I can't believe I've got my cup back, and I'm so happy.
It's all for the team. I'm happy to be able to help my team", said European Cup winner Garcia.
He handed the relay to John Ram, who defeated the legendary American Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single game of golf.
"I'm proud to have won Tiger Woods, and I'm a kid who grew up watching that guy play", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and posted a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
It's true that the statistics of one of the most legendary players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only twice as big as Jack Nicklaus.
The players of the US national team, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, were looking for a fairway throughout the weekend, and the trio performed at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after his teammates performed poorly, "I'm proud of the guys who fought to the end".
This morning we had a moment that shocked Europe.
We were defeated.
I have priority for Thomas.
He's a real captain.
The 12 players who followed him did well.
We're reorganizing the team, working closely with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're just moving forward.
I love all 12 players and it's a great honor to be their captain.
You need to shave your head.
We played hard".
