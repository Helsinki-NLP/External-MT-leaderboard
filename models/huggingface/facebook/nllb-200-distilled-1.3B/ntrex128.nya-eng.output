Members of Parliament are concerned about 'looking stupid'
There is confusion among some Members of Parliament who have the view that their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has been caused by a proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament from various political parties are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that it "sounded like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means original and pwp means dung.
A Plaid Party MP said the whole group was "not happy" and would take other measures.
One Welsh Conservative said his party was "open to other ideas" on the name change, but noted that it was an acronym from MWP to Muppet.
In this case the Welsh w is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to establish the title, said: "The final decision on the designation of Members of Parliament is a matter for those members to consider".
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public poll in which it found that the public supported the proposal to change the name of the building to the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of Members of Parliament, the Commission preferred the title Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP proposal received a great deal of public support.
The AMs appear to be making some decisions, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a major challenge for the Director, Elin Jones, who is expected to issue an unconfirmed order on the change within weeks.
The reform bill also includes other changes to the functioning of the parliament, including rules on the dismissal of Members of Parliament and the composition of committees.
The members of the Parliament will receive the final vote on the question of what the building will be called after the debate on the bill.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote Sunday to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was instituted to settle a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbors represents its ownership of the region and has repeatedly refused to support their bids for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the name change, said he would not vote.
However, supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is a cost of joining the EU and NATO
St. Martin's Bells Silent as Harlem Churches Faced Trouble
According to history, the older people I spoke to said there were bars and churches everywhere", said Mr. Adams.
"Now, there is none".
He also said that the lack of bars was understandable.
"People have different social networks" today, he said.
"A bar is not a dining room where people go often".
As for the churches, they are concerned that the stock market will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and will soon return to where it started".
He also said that churches could be replaced by tall buildings with sections filled with people who would not support the nearby shrines that remain.
"Many of the buyers of the new buildings are white", he said, "and so it will hasten the day when these churches will be closed down altogether because it is unlikely that many of the people moving into these buildings will be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black city - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A black congregation that worshipped nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike by vendors on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but after Mr. Johnson's followers began to rebuild the building, they installed several bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Mr. Johnson's son and next in line at St. Martin's, proudly called the installed bells "the bells of the poor".
The scholar who finished the bell in July called it something: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Scholar Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that these were the first bells in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the main bell chamber at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martin's has not replaced them.
The events at St. Martin's in recent months have been a sensitive subject for architects and contractors, some brought in by local church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The so-called regular churchgoers' association - a parish governing body, made up of lay clergy - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "requires a regular churchgoer association to pay for the expenses", although the regular churchgoers did not participate in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent to carry out the work.
Some regular churchgoers complain that the diocese is not being transparent.
A 13-year-old swimmer in California was injured by a shark
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday who was swimming in California on the first day of the swimming events, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was playing swimming with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then climbed in with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought I was just catching crabs, but then "he realized that he was screaming, 'I've been bitten!
I have been bitten!'
His entire shoulder was torn", Hammel said, "he realized it as soon as he got to the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was admitted to the intensive care unit.
The species of shark that injured him was not known.
Marine patrol Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that they were not a harmful species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper arm.
Authorities closed the public access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami of Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and develop local safety measures.
Giles says that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most do not appear to be threatened.
Sainsbury's plans to open a jewellery store in the UK
Sainbury's will compete with other retailers such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams which have stores with sections and beautiful shelves that are staffed by other specialist service providers.
As part of a major move towards the UK's $2.8bn jewellery retail market, which continues to grow as the clothing and homewares market rebounds, a new beauty store with doors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out to other stores next year if it proves successful.
The idea of entering the cosmetics business came about because supermarkets were looking for ways to use shelves used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it could double the size of its jewellery offerings to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be available in many locations with the same logo as those found in stores like Boots.
This supermarket is also launching a cosmetics store so that many products are suitable for vegetarians - something young consumers are eagerly waiting for.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will try to sell in two Sainburys stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift from a daily snack to a convenience store mean that stores have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, head of Sainbury's, said the store will look like a department store as the multi-brand supermarket tries to compete with Aldi's low-price store and Lidl's more than food offerings.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also launched a number of residential locations since it bought two branches two years ago, which it says has boosted grocery sales and made the brand more profitable.
The store's recent attempt to revamp its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to distribute the profits from the drug stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for $125m, three years ago.
He also suggested Lloyd should be involved in the project, adding a range of skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a sales manager at Sainbury, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beautiful doors to beautify the shopping area.
We have also spent a lot of money on our well-trained friends who will be there to give advice.
Our product range is designed to suit every need and the beautiful landscape and easy access means that we are now an attractive place that challenges the old shopping style".
Peter Jones was 'angry' over Holly Willoughby's departure from a $11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was left 'angry' over the departure of TV presenter Holly Willoughby from an £11million deal for his high-quality advertising business model to focus on his new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time to run his Truly business, which sold home furnishings and other items.
The duo's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business model.
The This Morning presenter, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon Den's Peter Jones in anger over leaving a highly profitable advertising business contract at the last minute - to focus on her new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones "was furious when the TV talent admitted at a tough meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract - worth £1.5 million - meant she had no time to manage their Truly homewear and accessories business.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop business model and has been touted as gaining Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
At the time Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane and left Britain for her other vacation home.
The source said: Truly was a key to Holly's priorities.
This was a long-term prospect that would keep him employed for decades to come.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in shock.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was about to be resumed.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at Marlow HQ.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most trusted talent, could cost the industry millions of dollars because of the huge spending on products such as pillows and candles and homewares, as well as the potential for delay in starting a business.
And it can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp started Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple is on vacation together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is becoming an ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's guest on I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We can't say anything about his business".
The main issue 'and then we loved each other'
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the media for making comments some would consider "unleadership" and being assertive of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a sacrifice?
Trump spoke in the words of his "readers" with disdain.
"I have given nothing . "
He also said Kim would attend the second summit after their first summit in Singapore in June, which Trump described as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "an equivalent action" from the U.S. in terms of North Korea's previous arms embargo.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose enforced punishments.
Trump was very optimistic about what he said at the summit.
"We are doing well with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of lives could have been lost.
We are now very close".
He also said that their efforts to build a good relationship with Kim have produced positive results - halting rocket tests, causing the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of US troops.
And he justified his unusual approach by talking about his friendship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into the arena, we have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy and Kill Island
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, no national disaster was reported, which is a necessity since international aid is needed.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they do not seek help from other countries, so it is a bit difficult", said Sister Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to move to Palu, it is unclear whether these foreign workers will be allowed to work.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for disaster response, said Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international aid agencies are allowed to provide assistance.
Although Indonesia is prone to earthquakes, the country is not well prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami houses have been built in Aceh, these are unusual on other beaches.
The absence of a tsunami warning system in Palu, although a warning had already been issued, must have contributed to the loss of life.
During the rainy season, travel between many of Indonesia's islands is extremely difficult.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
A medical van deployed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has promoted improving Indonesia's infrastructure as a key part of the election campaign, and has invested heavily in roads and railways
But the economic crisis has seriously affected Joko's government as he is due to be re-elected next year.
Joko is also experiencing problems because of religious unrest in Indonesia, where many Muslims have adopted a monotheistic approach.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim militants fight in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows, and other useless weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player scored the equaliser in the penultimate minute.
The player saved Liverpool from a losing streak against Chelsea by scoring in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge, who was 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri as his team trailed 1-0.
He passed the ball to the left and then pulled a bomb which hit the side away from Sturridge.
The ball rose up and headed for the upper corner of the net.
The ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who had jumped and entered the net.
It was an effort to get in the spotlight and get the ball and players like Shaqiri pass the ball forward often, so I tried to make the most of the opportunity I could Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I hit the ball once and then pulled the bomb without thinking twice".
Chelsea lead 1-0 at the end of the first half after a goal in the 25th minute by the Belgian star Edin Hazard.
The Chelsea forward passed the ball to Kovacic with his heel in the middle of the field and then turned and ran into the Liverpool side's goal.
Kovacic passed the ball to a teammate who returned it to him in the middle of the field.
He then delivered a good ball that targeted Hazard in the goal box at Liverpool.
Hazard ran over the defenders behind Liverpool and with his left foot hit a ball that passed Alisson Becker and entered the goal on the far side of Hazard.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier on Sunday.
Thousands of people are reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
Palu, a city of over 380,000, was covered with rubble from destroyed houses.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of killing woman with a knife
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with blunt force trauma at Grayson Mews in John Street at 7.55am, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged the local people who see or hear anything to come.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can capture anything on the dashcam to contact us because they may have keywords that are important to our investigation.'
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside the house.
This evening friends who believe they know the woman have come to the scene to ask questions about her whereabouts this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police say they are busy informing the family of the deceased.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his house but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he realized what had happened, he was at a loss for words.
Residents are now being told that it will take hours before they are allowed back into their homes.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He kept saying 'it's too bad'.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police cars were in the courtyard, one outside.
Several officers were standing in the courtyard inspecting the quarters.
Anyone with knowledge of the incident is requested to send a message to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers confidentially on 0800 555 111 quoting log 247 of 30 September.
A statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the final reminder of the beating of 'history-changing'
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of much of England's moral and religious fabric by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's ideas as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate over the removal of statues that the issue of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside Westminster Palace should not be discussed.
The depiction of civil war in England was neither suggested nor done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the misguided Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
The beautiful Cromwell portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century thinking and another piece of the history of a man many believe still to be worthy of admiration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentarian against foreign pressure, in his case the king.
Whether this is a complete demonstration is a continuation of the age-old controversy.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century changed the course of our country's development, and Cromwell is a prominent figure who represents one side of the spectrum.
His role as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and memory".
A Chinese farmer was bitten and killed by a pig
A farmer was bitten and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known by his family name "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery, covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found the door to a nearby pigsty open.
He said that in the pigsty was a large pig with blood in its mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted", said the street, named after him "Wu", as reported by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from sneaking in, while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating to compensate for his death.
Although rare, there are reports of pigs harming humans.
In 2016, a pig injured a mother and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig crushed a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened the pig.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive but the taste of blood could be a "causal factor".
"It's just a game.
They are like children, curious ... not trying to hurt you.
You have to give them the respect they deserve", he said.
Hurricane Rosa remnants will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is bringing flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had Category 1 winds of 85 mph, beginning at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was located about 200 miles [385 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is being formed in the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as the storm begins to push moisture across the northeastern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, humid temperatures close to freezing winds could bring heavy rain to the southwest in the days ahead.
In that area, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause flooding, mudslides, and landslides.
The high humidity causes rainfall of up to 2 to 3 inches an hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods can be caused by the deterioration of the climate caused by tropical rainfall.
Traveling in the desert can be dangerous because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn small rivers into large rivers with powerful currents, and thunderstorms can produce wind and dust.
A cooling wind is coming and will bring heavy rain to the coastal areas of Southern California.
More than a half-inch of rain can fall, causing small debris and slippery roads
This will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Tropical downpours will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before spreading late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
October can vary in temperature throughout the U.S. as the Arctic freezes, but in the tropics it will remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to temperature changes over short distances.
There is a good example of temperature variation in different parts of the US on Sunday.
There is an average temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the temperature of the tropics is expected to rise again.
Most of the Central and eastern US is expected to see an early October 80 degree spread from the Southern Hemisphere to parts of the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above normal in the city.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a greater likelihood of high temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first quarter of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh gave his testimony Thursday with Christine Blasey Ford who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political battle rages on, while the media interrupts the regular programming for a last-minute segment on Friday: a speech prepared by Arizona Sen. Fl Flake for the FBI's week-long investigation into the cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had been caught drunk and attempting to undress at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a kindly remark, said he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
It is estimated that over 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday saw this happen.
The company was calculating the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Some ratings were not immediately available on other networks that aired the show, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has a hard time getting the numbers of people watching in the office.
To illustrate, the size of the audience is similar to that at a football game or a Graduation Ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which has its own TV presenter closely aligned with Kavanaughled's nomination, outperformed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the entire day of the hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest in the ending of the story remained high.
Flake was a key player in Friday's events.
After the Republican presidential primaries announced that they would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being shouted by the opposition just as they were about to board a bus to the Judiciary Committee meeting.
She had stood face down for a few minutes in shame, on CNN television.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the world the truth?
She was told, "You have strength that most women do not have".'"
Flake said the office had issued an announcement and said that, before the terminal closed, he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
All Internet and television stations broadcast the case simultaneously in the following hours, as the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to approve Kavanaugh's nomination for a full Senate vote
But Flake said he would do so if he understood the FBI's investigation into the alleged candidate's case the following week, which a few Democrats were pushing.
Flake agreed to it in part in a discussion with his colleague, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was influential, for it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without a referendum.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the Kavanaugh case.
British Prime Minister May accused protesters of 'playing politics' with Brexit
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her exit from the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national importance in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party rally in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In an interview near the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued to challenge his plan known as the UK's Future of Brexit, saying that the idea of Britain and the EU receiving each other's money was "a no-brainer"."
Wayde Sims shot dead: Dyteon Simpson arrested on suspicion of killing LSU player
Police arrest a suspect in the murder of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video about the argument between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses at the scene and have found Simpson's DNA on those glasses, according to reports the WAFB has a deal with CBS.
When Simpson was questioned, police said he agreed to shoot Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, the Attorney General said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police escape team, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and local residents for assisting in the investigation that led to his arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for working "diligently and with integrity".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-6-foot center grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 assists per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you always complain about", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash from Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Risk Management Agency warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it re-emerged in the valley and recorded 183 gases and ash for 24 hours.
The council was responsible for the murmuring and trembling that was taking place in the area.
Television images show a small amount of ash covering the windows of cars in areas of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Astronomers have seen an increase in volcanic activity at a 45-mile (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been erupting continuously since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the right to vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following a clash between anti-riot police and activists, and as thousands of people joined the protest to mark the anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote.
A group of masked protesters banned by riot police threw eggs at them and sprayed powder paint on them, creating black and dusty clouds on streets often crowded with tourists.
Violence broke out again during the day with police using batons to stop the fighting.
For hours independence groups chanting "Forget not, no pardon" met with union protesters shouting, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained during the riot, local media reported.
Security threats remain in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 election that was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalan independence movement.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although those opposed to secession did not attend the majority and did not vote at all.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when police attempted to disrupt voting at polling stations in the region and triggered riots.
Independence groups set up camps and stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protesters from turning violent in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to be held in a different way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who is taking part in the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer believed Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year was a very good year.
I saw my parents crying for joy after voting but now we are back again", he said.
Despite achieving a modest victory in the December local elections, Catalan independence parties have been struggling to get back on the ground this year with their most prominent leaders in solitary confinement or in jail awaiting trial for allowing the election and declaring their independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstrations in collaboration with the police on her mobile phone, said the debate involved politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more dangerous", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Competing in European elections is one of the best ways to strengthen the fight against the democratic and oppressive forces we have seen in Spain", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after hitting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit repeatedly by a car in a house in Londonderry.
This happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building.
The bow may also be thrown at a car at a later time.
Menga's goal gave Rangers a 1-0 win against Livingstone.
Dolly Menga's first goal gave Livingstone's team a victory.
Livingston's improved team surprised the Rangers team and resulted in Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal brought Gary Holt's team to a draw with Ireland in the second half.
Gerrard's side will remain the Premier League champions this season, and next Sunday they will face Hearts on their highest point, eight points behind them.
Prior to the match, Rangers will play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, is raising their league win-loss record to six, and team principal Holt has been unbeaten since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's team misses a chance against the visitors
Holt's side must have been ahead before the goal, and their dominance of the ball is causing problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson got a chance but failed to score in front of goal, then Alan Lithgow just tried his best to meet Craig Halket's head ball near the goal.
The goalkeepers were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could harass the visitors with the flames.
This was how the most important goal was achieved.
Rangers made a mistake and started a fielder and Livingston's side took advantage, while Declan Gallagher and Robinson passed the ball and found Menga, who touched the ball from the middle of the box and scored.
Meanwhile, the Rangers were the defending champions but found that the goalkeepers were not easily penetrated and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not harmed.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos showed a man in blocking Kelly's ball.
Scott Pittman's ball was blocked by the feet of Ranger Allan McGregor's goalkeeper and Lithgow failed to score on Livingstone's fielder.
Cross-country balls regularly entered Livingston's box and were removed continuously, while two penalty requests were denied - after Halkett's error against substitute Glenn Middleton, and another error involving a catch.
'Amazing' from Livingston's team - according to one observer
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Good play and impressive results for the Livingston team.
To me, they have played much better, more than we could have hoped for in this progressive victory.
He has not changed his style of play and his players have since won more games than any other team, but the greatest credit should go to Holt for the way he has helped the team since his arrival.
He had many talented players.
The team captain Halkett was a valuable asset in the game, propelling his well-prepared defenders, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall busy.
The Rangers were not encouraged, however.
It lacked the good values it had at times under Gerrard's leadership.
Their last game was not good - they only managed to score a try against the away team - and it was a surprise for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
It was a smile and a smile on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany - a visit aimed at improving relations between NATO members.
He discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to officially open the new grand mosque.
The city is home to a large number of Turkish expatriates.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many followers came closer to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents - mostly Kurds - also voiced their opposition, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-part exhibition shows the divided opinion of this stranger whom some German Turks regard as a hero and a tyrant to others.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle rider killed after colliding with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The drivers stopped and emergency workers tried to provide medical assistance, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after a cyclist died in a crash on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The City Police said they were working to identify the man and notify his family.
Road closures and bus congestion are in place and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six officers have been injured in a riot at a maximum-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The riot started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is continuing.
"Tornado" specialists have been brought in to deal with the riot, which involves eight inmates and is taking place in one area.
The officers were given medical treatment after suffering minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Well-trained prison staff have been sent to deal with the situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be sent to the police and could spend long periods in prison".
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous.
In June it was reported that the prison warden had received medical treatment after an arrest.
And in October last year the police were called to the prison to deal with a major riot when their staff were beaten.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens to Destroy Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and Flood (Drought Areas Can Benefit)
It is unlikely that the storm will hit Arizona, but it is likely to do so early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will cross the Western Desert, posing a flood threat.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning that flood risk will be monitored Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix on Tuesday, and to approach again late on Monday in the rain.
The Phoenix International Weather Service tweeted that "only ten hurricanes have maintained a hurricane or tropical storm intensity within Phoenix of 200 miles since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that struck 40 miles across the AZ border".
The latest images from the International Hurricane Center forecast 2 to 4 inches of rain, with 6 inches of rainfall in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Some areas of the Western Desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin can be 1 to 2 inches, with a chance of waterfall at various points of up to 4 inches.
For those not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rainfall can be a blessing as the region experiences drought.
While flooding is a serious problem, some rain may be beneficial as the Southwest experiences drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-largest such drought, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will cause landslides in the Baja California region of Mexico.
Rosa, still a strong storm Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is being pushed by the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and is losing its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico on a storm surge Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains in some parts of Mexico can be heavy, posing a risk of flooding in the area.
"Rainfall of up to 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible of up to 10 inches", weather.com reported.
Rosa will head north through Mexico as a hurricane before hitting the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, which will then move through Arizona and southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause devastating floods, desert erosion, and landslides.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was "well".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police officials have asked anyone with video of the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'encountered, cruelty, anger' from the Democratic Party
"The Judge Kavanaugh vote is a vote against the Democratic Party's brutal and dangerous policies", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "had faced the Democratic Party's harsh, brutal, and angry" throughout his election.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and vehemently denying the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had been raped decades earlier as a teenager.
Ford also testified to his claims.
On Saturday the President said "the American people saw the talent and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The confirmation vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the most successful jurists of our time, a judge with a remarkable record of public service", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking of the importance of a positive outcome for Republican candidates in the midterm elections.
Five weeks remain before one of the most important decisions of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm running fast", he said.
"That is why I am everywhere fighting for the right candidates".
Trump said Democrats aim to "resist and block".
The first major step in the Senate vote process for Kavanaugh's election is expected to take place before Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll is rising
More than 384 people were killed, many of them washed up on the shore, as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday as waves as high as 6 metres (18 feet) broke the beach in the evening and swept many to death and destroyed everything in its path.
A tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat began yesterday, people were still working on the land and not running away, and they were affected", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it pulled cars, trucks, houses, and cargoes out", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the ocean at 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many houses and shops destroyed, bridges broken and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Several earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's location is at the end of a long, narrow harbor, and that has increased the spread of tsunamis, it said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are unaccounted for.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be severe along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggala region, which is the closest to the epicentre.
Communication systems were "completely affected and there was little information about the situation" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there", the Red Cross said, adding that staff and volunteers are going to the affected areas.
It is already a problem, but it can grow, it said.
On Saturday the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves came at the same time the warning was issued.
In an unverified video shared on social media a man can be heard on the roof of a house screaming to warn people on the street below that a tsunami is approaching.
Within minutes a wall of water fell on the beach, washing away houses and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video at the time.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages that rendered communications systems inoperable and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Military aircraft have begun to fly supplies from Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but survivors still need food and other necessities.
The city's airport was opened for emergency services only and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the rescue centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It is a terrible thing.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached Palu, where staff are living in wooden bags set up in the courtyard of their office, they have come across damaged areas on their way, said Mr Doseba.
He told me he had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
It is terrible.
While relief groups began to prepare to provide aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be moved if a national disaster is declared.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, "OK, it's a national disaster", we can ask for help from other countries but no such information has been provided yet".
On the second night that fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing had hopes that their loved ones would return as a miracle unprecedented in the history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was carried out of the toilet.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubbish for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute team, had trained two of the missing players at the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those detained at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
"As a champion parachutist, I have my own concerns", he said.
Mr Gendon also recounted how, a few hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the parachutists, he tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu players, who were taking part in the beach party.
His messages, however, introduced only one white flag, instead of two blue flags.
I think it means the messages didn't come", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while a car leaves cash in a cash machine at a Newport restaurant and tourist attraction
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a cash machine in a Newport restaurant and tourist attraction.
The drivers leave cash in the casino and plan to leave more, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in his report.
While the drivers were busy, a man walked past the back of a Brink's worker and stole the bag of money that the drivers were supposed to leave behind.
According to eyewitness reports, several people were seen fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many.
Anyone with information about the victims should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The singer changed his name to Ye
Singer Kanye West is changing his name to - Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Kanye West".
West, 41, was known as Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album titled Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show who left "for reasons of disagreement", said the show's producer.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'he' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
It comes from Kanye, meaning alone, to just Ye - a mere reflection of our good qualities, our flaws, our confusions, all of it.
This album is a clear indication of who we are".
He is one of the most famous musicians who change names.
Sean Combs is better known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for romance names like Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, JAY-Z, also announced that his name could be pronounced there with or without a hyphen.
MEXICO'S governments vow not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to use no military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the massacre.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military forces shot at peaceful student demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing some 300 people at a time when school groups were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to those who study and opening several free public universities.
He also said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to join the terrorist movement.
U.S. government to raise money for robotics
As China advances in robotics, the United States should increase its investment in research in this area, says entrepreneur and robotics advocate Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This has led to many U.S. government agencies announcing their intention to use AI, while the country has no effective AI program.
Meanwhile, China launched the program last year: and aims to be the No. 1 in the use of this technology by 2030.
"Increasing research funding would be a good start, given that all countries are far behind the U.S., and we need to find more advanced jobs in this field", Lee said.
The additional funding could double the chances of AI-related successes in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a China-based startup that has invested heavily in AI research, Face++.
In the 1980s, while at Carnegie Mellon University, he invented a machine that beat the great playwright Othello and later became the head of Research at Microsoft and the head of Google in China.
Lee expressed his appreciation for the launch of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and wanted to know when the competition would be held again to help identify the next generation of experts.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government awards, Lee said.
"It's not China that is hiring educated people; it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other companies have been recruiting university experts to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that reforming immigration policies could also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think that people with PhDs in robotics should be granted citizenship.
China launched its National Energy Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for schools similar to that of the National Natural Science Foundation and other government agencies for researchers in the United States, but Chinese education is limited, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to include industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
And the National Security Commission spends $100 million a year on the development of AI.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
The vote on Sunday was to decide whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that could lead to a long-running dispute with Greece over its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a region called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name represents the territory's ownership and has therefore been resisting Macedonia's registration as a member of NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of the two countries agreed to change the name of Macedonia, but cultural activists have rejected the proposal, saying the change of name is a mockery of the culture and history of the great nation of the Macedonian people.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the elections and that the large number of voters who did not vote has raised the risk that the voter turnout may not reach half the country's population to make the vote legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Do you want us to join NATO and the EU in the context of our alliance with Greece?".
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that it is a difficult but necessary step to allow the country to join the EU and NATO, and to break free from the former Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote to shape the future of our country, the future of young Macedonians to live freely as members of the European Union because this means that all people will live without fear", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is unconstitutional, many lawmakers have said they will support the results of the vote to make a meaningful statement.
The change of name would require approval by two-thirds of the legislature.
The country's election commission said there were no problems at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary elections for registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, we are Europeans", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in Macedonia's election for a name change that would open the way to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia September 30, 2018
In the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov arranges a youth parade and folds up chairs in front of the tents set up by the candidates.
"We want to be members of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with a clear mind, not by force", said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor, yes, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be a member like Macedonia, we can apply for membership in other organizations like Russia and China like the Euro-Asian Association".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would boost economic activity in Macedonia, which also has the highest unemployment rate.
"I hope that many will vote because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that a "yes" vote would determine our future".
A report released Monday by the country's research institute Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research indicated that about 30 to 43 percent of the population will participate in the elections - a number below the expected turnout.
The Telma TV union, which is the largest in the country, said 57 percent of those interviewed by the network would vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of those polled said they would vote in favor of changing the country's name.
To be successful, the elections require 50 percent of the votes plus one vote.
The rejection of the idea marks the first failure of a European-style government since the May coup.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero crosses the back of Brighton's goal barrier to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crossed the back of the Brighton team as Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward got the ball in the middle of the field first.
He ran with the ball and passed three backs and then got an opportunity.
Aguero then faced four Brighton players.
Then he ran behind one of the defenders and passed the other defenders into the Brighton goal box.
He then passed the ball to Sterling, who was on his left.
The England player hit the ball once and returned it to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot through the goalpost past Mathew Ryan to the right of the goal net.
"Aguero is suffering from pain in his legs", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
And that is what happened.
We were fortunate that he scored a goal in that time".
But it was Sterling who led the team to a place in the Cup Winners' Cup.
His goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a football scholarship to the Brighton club.
He then passed a good ball to Leroy Sane on the left side of the pitch.
Sane hit the ball several times and then passed it to Sterling to lead him to the goal.
Sterling just pushed the ball into the net as it was about to slide across the line.
Manchester City will play Hoffenheim in the European Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at Sinheim Stadium, Germany.
Scherzer wants a separate game with the Rockies
When the Nationals were pulled out of the bullpen, there was no need to restart the game.
But the hard-nosed Scherzer wants to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, unless the outcome of the game is scheduled to affect the championship, which the Rockies, led by the Los Angeles Dodgers, are in the NL West.
The Rockies had a chance to win 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still eager to win their first league title.
"Even if we don't win anything at the games, we're going to go into the stadium knowing that the Denver crowd and the team will give us the biggest game I can play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play games like that?"
The Nationals have not announced who will start Sunday, but it seems they have plans to let Scherzer out to play first.
Scherzer, who will be playing his 34th game, had his baseball practice on Thursday and will be playing Sunday after a full break.
The Washington native is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings over two-thirds of an inning this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
The President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking of the importance of a positive outcome for Republican candidates in the midterm elections.
All our achievements are at stake in November.
Five weeks remain before one of the most important decisions of our time.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running but I'm running very fast and that's why I'm everywhere fighting the good fight", he said.
Trump continued, "You see a very, very dangerous group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And determined to restore power by any means necessary, you see the difficult, the ugly.
They don't care who is hurting them, who has to cross over to get power and control, who wants only power and control, and we don't give them that".
The Democrats, he said, aim to "resist and suppress".
"And you've seen this in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and cruel and evil and dishonest".
He also mentioned the name of the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein of the Democrat Party, which was met with criticism from the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you produce the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting together - that was the worst body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer the main party.
He does not let anyone dictate his feelings
When the Momentum supporters in my party decided to criticize me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last Labour MP to be told we are not welcome - all because of our expression of feelings.
My parliamentarian Joan Ryan was similarly treated for speaking out against religious prejudice.
For me, the experimenter criticized me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the need for sound economic policies, on national security, in Europe, issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice from the Nottingham East Labor Conference on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For eight years as a Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday nights were the same.
Sadly, today, that is not how many conferences were held and the promise of "good, moderate" politics has been forgotten.
It also seems that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as friends who I thought I had political sympathies with began to expect me to change and take positions I did not agree with - either on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak out - and no matter what I say - there is a social media backlash demanding that I not be elected, criticizing local politics, telling me not to be a member of the Labour Party.
And it is not the only experience I have.
Of course, I know I have a better chance than some of my peers as the comments that have been made about me tend to be political.
I admire the skills and dedication of my peers who face sexual abuse or discrimination every day without shame.
One of the most frustrating aspects of our political age is how reports of violence are seen as normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should adopt a more inclusive culture.
The truth is that we are no longer the largest congregation and with every "disappointment" or change in policy the party shrinks.
I have had a lot of counseling over the last two years where they encourage me to lower my head, not be too talkative, and be a better person".
But that was not the reason I became involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, angered by the Thatcher government's failure to provide jobs that left my entire classroom in a very poor school, I have tried to promote good public services to those who need them most - whether as a home secretary or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, including the recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way disturbed by my policies and issues I disagreed with the new leadership.
To all those who supported the idea on Friday, all I can say is that as the country enters a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and public services, I don't understand my intention to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for the constituency I represent, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no electoral or political interference will stop me from doing what I believe is important to all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's undefeated team reaches the top
The final two goals changed the outcome, but not surprisingly, Ayr was favored to win the exciting game, the Tennets League.
Ayr is at the top, and it is the only team that has never been beaten by a team in the top ten.
In the end, it was the good play of the defensive backs that made the team's success possible, as their players did not use many of the openings, which pleased the coach, Peter Murchie.
"We've had tough teams but we never gave up, so I have to be happy", he said.
"The team of Ayr deserves credit", said Melrose's Robyn Christie, "they made better use of their opportunities than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute shot was used by Ayr's Frazier Climo, but the yellow card from Rory Hughes of Scotland, led to Melrose's team being narrowed by Jason Baggot.
Climo added to Ayr's score through the penalty area and scored again before the end of the first half to give Ayr a 17-5 lead.
But Melrose's team had a good start to the second half and Patrick Anderson's chances were used well by Baggot, who scored to reduce the lead to 5.
The game was then stopped due to injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried on his thighs, after the game resumed Ayr added goals through Climo who danced through a gap prepared by Stafford McDowall.
Ayr's vice-captain Blair Macpherson also received a yellow card and was released and Melrose again took advantage of their overtime and scoring a try to Bruce Colvine, putting pressure on Ayr's side.
The home team scored again, and, after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for hitting Climo without a ball, on the penalty line, MacPherson scored for Ayr.
Climo danced, as he did when the ball returned, this happened after Kyle Rowe hit the ball in the box and gave Gregor Henry a fifth chance for his team.

'The sea is ours ': Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will reopen the Pacific road
The marines control the naval base at La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag.
The waterfront campgrounds from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the following inscription: The sea is ours by right.
It is our responsibility".
Across the remote Bolivian coast, the memory of Chile's lost beach in the bloody war of the 20th century is still familiar - as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That expectation is perhaps the highest in decades now, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a strong, united and peaceful spirit, and it has great hope and confidence in the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian ambassador.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ ruling at major demonstrations across the country, hoping that the Hague court will support what Bolivia claims - after years of legitimate negotiations - Chile must negotiate to give Bolivia a maritime zone.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's most popular president - facing a tough re-election campaign next year - also has high hopes for Monday's ruling.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean, "he promised in late August.
But some experts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia - and little may change as a result.
The UN delegation from the Netherlands has no authority to grant Chile territory, and has said it does not recognize the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes just six months after the final cases were heard shows that the case "was not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean legal expert.
Besides furthering Bolivia's cause, the past four years have probably brought the country back to life.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken up by the local Bolivian authorities", said Zárate.
Morales' harsh rhetoric has destroyed all that is good left in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the dialogue, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decisions were surprisingly hasty.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to establish new relations with Chile" and a chance to "break 139 years of conflict and build productive relations", he said.
Calzadilla also argued that Morales - one of the most influential presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime issue as a political strategy.
"Bolivia will not give up its right to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to put the past behind us".
North Korea says it will not destroy nuclear weapons unless it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not destroy its first nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore summit between the two leaders.
His remarks come after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared poised to resume nuclear talks that had stalled for three months at a Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "just a dream" that continuing with economic sanctions and the US refusal to declare the Korean War over will make the North kneel.
Washington does not want to make that announcement before Pyongyang begins to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang will be able to decide to abandon the weapons that the country considers its only means of defense.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows unveil a series of new hats on the way to High Street near you
If you need a hat or a sunscreen, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of large SS19 hats on the street that delighted and surprised those with other fashions at Paris Fashion Week.
The unimaginable hats were posted on Instagram last summer and the designers have brought their most eye-catching creations to the street.
Valentino's bright hat was a large, high-quality one adorned with feathery feathers that filled the heads of the models.
Other larger additions include the velvet, the strange hat and the pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a new range of face masks - and on the occasion of Halloween.
Many of the beautiful masks were lip-stitched and more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembles a swimming pool filled with tubes and mirrors, while another looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep talking about these fashions - you're lucky.
Fashion insiders predict that large bonnets may make their way to the highways near you.
The big hats stand out along with 'La Bomba' shoes, a two-legged straw hat that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A religious symbol behind an unimaginable hat that went viral on social media sent another giant creature onto the street market - a beach bag made of grass almost as big as swimming trunks.
An orange-red, palm-colored purse with a white leather strap was the centerpiece of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags hit the high street this summer - as the designer has been so affected it can be difficult to ignore the importance of big brands.'
John Edward: The ability to speak different languages is a necessity for all people on earth
Independent schools in Scotland have a very good academic record, and this has continued in 2018 with some good test results, only boosted by excellence in sports, the arts, music and more.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible services for children and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen profession, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement personalized school curricula, we see modern languages continue to be the most sought-after subjects in schools.
"When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it just goes to his head", said Nelson Mandela.
If you speak to him in his own language, it touches his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build friendships and relationships with people from other lands.
From the results of this year's recent tests, we can see that languages are being studied by many and are doing well in these subjects in private schools.
About 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages performed very well and achieved A-grade outcomes.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved A-grade results in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also achieved A-grade results.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign language education as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject of choice, are being equally taken into consideration in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) curricula in private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey found that for the reasons employers have struggled to find qualified people, 17 percent cited a lack of people with language skills.
Language skills are therefore essential to prepare youths for future careers.
Since more job opportunities open up with language skills, these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, learning a second language will give him the opportunity to develop such a life-long skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign lands puts a multilingual person first.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate effectively and only French was spoken by a double-digit percentage, of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language education programs is now essential for modern children.
Having more than one language, especially in developing lands, will help children to find better jobs.
In Scotland, each school differs in the language of instruction.
A number of schools will focus on modern languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as important in the UK in preparation for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a choice of several languages in private schools, with teachers who are experts in these fields.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to developing learning strategies that prepare children and provide them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied at present, in the global business world, that languages continue to be of great importance in the future of the world, and this must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be thought of as "universal communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, proliferation and success to Scottish children.
It must be done.
John Edward and the President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's first appearance for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans hoping to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long they were to play was not known.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote that James may be able to play a few minutes.
Following a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule".
"I don't need a pre-season game at this point to prepare", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump has been holding a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is one of five Trump rallies next week, including stand-up rallies in places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his Supreme Court nominee on hold, Trump wants to call the midterm elections as his Republican Party risks losing control of the House in November elections.
When and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally is at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting live on the Internet through the Internet site YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's case, which has sparked outrage over Kavanaugh's alleged attempted rape as the confirmation vote is now delayed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of the fall meetings is to give the Republican Party a head start in the November elections.
Thus, the purpose of Trump's five presidential campaigns is "to encourage supporters and the public good as the Republican Party seeks to preserve and expand its congressional majority", reports Reuters.
"The presence of a large number of advisers is a key factor in the fact that presidents have to hold these meetings in many places during the campaign", one of Trump's campaign managers told Reuters.
The convention, to be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, will be open to audiences from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be broadcast by Pittsburgh radio", according to the West Virginia Metro.
Saturday will mark the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is also running in the election.
"The presidential election campaign does not give Morrisey a good image", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA showcases a man on the winning side of their game to keep their chances as Sunday's game approaches
After three games, a Saturday four-man match can become a Ryder Cup match.
Change is a difficult thing to fix in sports, yet it is something that players especially rely on in competitions like this.
Who, then, have the opportunity now?
"They led by six points but now they're down to four, so we're taking this as a chance", said Jordan Spieth as he walked softly.
The European team has a chance, leading by 4 points with twelve games to go.
The American team, Spieth says, feels that they have much to be proud of, such as the performance of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has done well and has set a good example.
As he and Thomas kept screaming, the ball hit the hole, and the teams were tied four points to four.
His shot to the 15th hole won the game and the crowd shouted back, showing his confidence that the American team was not defeated.
"You just have to put on your uniform and focus on your game", Spieth said.
That's what all these players have here.
Only 18 holes and the team has scored a man.
The players with the most points over Spieth and Thomas in the two days are Frascesco Milinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the current Ryder Cup champions.
The two favorite European players have won four of four and can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" were the only two-team players who did not play a ball near the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final 9 holes.
This, along with their enthusiasm and their speed, proves that they are the team to beat on Sunday, and no player can beat a European team better than Fleetwood or Molinari at sunset at Le Golf National.
Perhaps they are in different pits.
It is still too early to say that the European team has won the cup, for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily defeated Sergio Garcia, who was Alex Noren's teammate, in a four-ball morning game.
A close pitch and two shots in the first nine holes led their team to the point where the Spanish and Swedish champions refused to return.
But Sunday is not a success to be underestimated.
Four-man football games are a delight to watch because of the interaction between the two players, the instructions given, the instructions not given, and the flexibility of the game.
So far the European team has played very well as a team and is heading for the finals with a good lead but the four-man match showed that the American team has a great potential, which is especially doubted by the Stateside.
European team leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
The European team will have a strong chance to play in the Ryder Cup final after beating the American team in a four-game sweep on Saturday by 10-6 points.
Inspired by the team of Tiger Woods' struggling teammates Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, their victory at Le Golf National brought their points to four.
The European team, coached by Thomas Bjorn, in a bid to reclaim the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine Stadium, pressured the American team in their morning four-ball match, with a 3-1 lead.
The American team was strong in the four-ball game, winning two games, but it did not prevent the victory.
A team coached by Jim Furyk needs eight points in 12 Sunday games to win the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four consecutive points in the tournament and through their strong performance this weekend, he and Molinari, known to fans as "Molliwood", are the second pair of players to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After a brutal defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarter-finals, Woods defeated Bryson Dechambeau, the first American player in the tournament, by a score of 5 and 4.
Woods, who tried to pull through in two games on Saturday, has shown occasional masculinity but has so far lost 19 of 29 four-ball and four-man games and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, rested in the morning four-ball game, then teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the four-ball game and won by 2 points to 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -the world number one and number three.
On a cold day in the southwest of Paris, the European team did not pass cleanly.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the American team by two points on Saturday.
They won 2 points and 1 over Jon-Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fours and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4 and 3 in the fours despite losing their first two games.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team four points behind a team won a singles match, although the defending champion Furyk's team only needs to match the other team to win the cup.
After being the second team to do well for two days, Sunday's top-flight play looks set to be even more difficult.
North Korea says it has "no reason" to stop using its nuclear weapons
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that continued isolation only heightened mistrust of the United States and that there was no reason for his country to stop using nuclear weapons during that period.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual meeting that North Korea had taken "submissive" steps in the past year, including stopping nuclear tests and bombs, dismantling a nuclear reactor and pledging not to expand its nuclear arsenal.
"But we have never seen America do anything like this", he said.
"Without trust in America, we will not be satisfied with our national security and in this respect we cannot begin to disarm ourselves".
While Ri echoes North Korea's complaint about the United States' refusal to "gradually" denuclearize, which North Korea should be credited with, his remarks were effective because his country did not go as far as Pyongyang's refusal to denuclearize.
Ri cited a joint message between Kim Jong Un and Trump during the first US-North Korea summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to "de-nuclearize the Korean Peninsula" and Trump stressed North Korea's security.
North Korea has long called for an end to the war between North and South Korea, but the United States has demanded that North Korea first stop using nuclear weapons.
The United States has refused to ease the harsh sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States is pushing for a 'first nuclear disarmament' and has stepped up its pressure on North Korea, and the United States has also refused to 'declare an end to the war,'" Ri said.
"The idea of being forced to be disciplined is a fantasy for people who don't know us well.
But the problem is that the delay is only exacerbating our impatience".
Ri did not mention the second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US president said at the UN General Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister referred to the meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in five months ago and added: "If the nuclear disarmament issue had been between us and South Korea and not America, the disarmament issue on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a point of contention".
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was different from last year's speech at a U.N. summit. When he told them that targeting American territory with North Korean weapons was easy while "Evil President" Trump called Kim "an expert" on a pointless summit.
At this year's United Nations General Assembly, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for being the first man to give up nuclear weapons, but said more work needed to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea stopped using them.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit, saying "whether it's two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have asked the UN Security Council to respect North Korea's actions.
On the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions against North Korea should continue and not be suspended until we see that the country has completely stopped using nuclear weapons".
The Committee has been increasing its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb North Korea's funding of nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit North Korea next month to prepare for a second Trump-Kim summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
He left North Korea saying that the talks had gone well, but within hours North Korea had criticized him for providing "fraudulent information".
North Korea has promised to meet Moon this month to dismantle its nuclear facility and stockpile if the United States does "similar things".
They said Kim told them that "the same things" he wanted were Trump's security guarantees to Singapore and steps to improve relations with the United States.
Harvard University students study a study on promoting adequate sleep
A new study at Harvard University that began this year has been designed to encourage graduate students to get enough sleep to break the habit of reading all night using 'sleep-reducing' drugs.
One scholar noted that students at the world's top universities are not aware of the basic necessities of life.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted what he believes to be the first study of its kind in American history.
He recommended the introduction of this study after a lecture on the consequences of sleep deprivation.
'After graduation a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I being told this in my last year?'
He said no one had told him the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which began this year, explains to students the importance of proper sleep in education and sports, as well as its health benefits.
Paul Barreira, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and Director of the National Institutes of Health, said that the university decided to launch the study after discovering that many students were sleep deprived, especially during the week.
The one-hour study includes a series of interviews.
In one section is a picture of a dormitory room, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, teachers, and books to be told about the dangers of light and sleeping pills and the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance, as well as the importance of getting enough sleep.
In another way, students are told that sleep deprivation often puts people at risk for heart disease, depression, and cancer.
The school's colorful maps provide a message that encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
'We know that it does not change the behavior of students' instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the dangers of smoking,' said Professor Czeisler.
The proud attitude of 'studying all night' still exists, he said, adding that new skills and the students' stress and studying add to the sleeplessness of the students.
Ensuring adequate, healthy sleep is the students' 'secret weapon' against depression, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - and against obesity, for lack of sleep depletes the brain and makes it hungry more often.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old medical student in California, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the study because he had studied one of the courses taught by the professor during his first year at Harvard University.
He said that the study opened his eyes and moved him to encourage the professor to make the study available to everyone at the university.
As a result, he wants all graduates to complete a similar course before entering the university.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students set a timer to remind them of the time to go to bed and the time to wake up, and to be aware of the dangers of the light from cell phones, laptops, and electric lights that can cause the sleep-wake function to stop working.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal gave Gerrard's team a defeat
The Rangers won again on the road - when Dolly Menga's goal sent Gerrard's seemingly unstable side down 1-0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox side looked to win their first league title since February when they beat St Johnstone 4-1 but the Gary Holt-coached side beat Gerrard's side to give Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games since he took over, leaving the team eight points behind top-flight Hearts.
Menga scored with seven minutes to go in the first half and the Rangers, who were losing their support, were able to return.
While the Rangers have dropped six places in the league table, Livingston have moved up to third and are behind Hibernian on goals.
And there may be more to come for the Rangers when backup quarterback Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after being struck by what is thought to be a projectile.
Gerrard replaced eight players who beat Ayr to reach the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
While Holt did not change players who played and equalised for Hearts last week and must have been pleased with the way his team handed the Rangers.
Rangers were the defending champions, while Livingston was the defending champion.
He had to play in the first two minutes when Menga gave Scott Pittman a good ball to play on the goal with Allan McGregor but the midfielder hit his ball on the side.
A ball from a field played by Keaghan Jacobs caught Craig Halkett but Alan Lithgow but the defender and Craig Halkett fought on the side.
The Rangers showed a manly display of courage, but it was only a matter of hope and a lack of confidence, especially when they reached the goal.
Alfredo Morelos feels he should have been given a penalty in the 15th minute when he fought Steven Lawless but the players, Thomson, refused the Colombian.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by the balls from Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
The Livingston goal in the 34th minute was a game-changer, but it was a must-win.
The Rangers also refused to remove the ball from Jacobs's net.
Scott Arfield did not intercept the ball when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who played calmly and passed Menga who hit easily.
Gerrard expressed his dissatisfaction with the Rangers when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change could bear immediate fruit when the midfielder passed Morelos but Kelly, who played well, ran to get the ball out.
Livingston forced Rangers to play their favourite ball, and Lithgow and Halkett were forced to play their long balls.
Holt's side could have scored more in the second half but McGregor successfully blocked Jacobs, Lithgow before hitting the ball off the head.
Rangers outfielder Glenn Middleton scored another penalty after Jacobs, but Thomson, the players, refused the offer.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago to this day, and a COUNTING ... the date on which the future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure the energy released during atomic fission, a process that eventually led to the invention of the Geiger Counter.
As a major scientific tool since then, the Geiger Counter has become a popular tool, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear as unreliable scientists:
Brother: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to detect electron salts, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can feel the effects of the energy released by atoms".
Evans: "This is really amazing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But its products have survived.
A new cancer vaccine may help the immune system to "recognize" malignant cells
This new cancer vaccine may help the immune system to "recognize" and kill malignant cells
Vaccines have enabled the immune system to recognize malignant cells as a potential treatment.
This procedure involves extracting body cells from the patient, and then replacing them in the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein that is most likely to cause cancer and then inject it
Experimental vaccines are giving hope as they are being given to people with various cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who trains the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells from the patient's body, modifying them in the laboratory to "identify" a common cancer protein called HER2, and then reinserting the cells into the body.
"Our results suggest that we have a vaccine to help us", said Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "treats several types of cancer, "including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
The same technique of removing cells from patients and "training" them in cancer screening will also work in the treatment of leukemia.
After appearing on SNL, Kanye West launched a campaign in favor of Trump, wearing a hat labeled Make America Strong Again.
The End Is Not Good
Kanye West was humiliated in the studio on Saturday Night Live after performing a performance in which he praised the US President. and said Donald Trump would win the 2020 election.
After performing her third song Ghost Town that night, in which she wore a hat that read Make America Great Again, she made a harsh speech to Democrats and repeatedly supported Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and they say: "How can you like Mr. Trump, he's racist?"
So, if I was worried about racism I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL premiered the show with Matt Damon as the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's rape allegations.
Although not made public, West's comments were posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to taunt West with the postings.
Furthermore, West complained to the audience that he had suffered a lot from his hat behind the stage.
"He found me behind the stage.
'Don't go in there with that hat,' they said.
They found me!
Then they say I'm in a state of despair", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the vanishing point?" saying that "he will wear my hero's hat, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to show love".
His comments were twice scorned by the audience and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying: "The whole studio was just silent".
West was brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many when she performed her song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the head of the TPUSA self-defense group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STANDING OUT OF THE GROUP".
But talk show host Karen Hunter posted a comment on Twitter that West was "just being herself and it's so much fun".
"But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying music or clothes or supporting his "talent") who I believe approves and brings dangerous ideas to our community.
They have freedom.
As do we", he added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he is currently "Kanye West".
He is not the first singer to change their names and follow the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow musician, Snoop Dogg was once referred to as Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince, changed his name to the trademark then musician known in the past as Prince.
Attempted murder in a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is on trial for attempted murder after he shot a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is due to appear in Belfast County Court on Monday.
His cases are handled by the Judicial Committee.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is angered by the male horror
Kit Harington, known for his knife-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has challenged the idea of heroism, saying that such media roles mean that young boys often feel like they have to be mature to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed 'something is wrong' and asked about ways to deal with the fearful stereotypes about masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, also a Game of Thrones star, admitted that he feels it is "important" to deal with this problem.
'Personally, I wonder right now - where did we throw it to get it?' he said.
'What are we teaching men as they grow up, especially in the face of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be one factor in the development of this trait but thanks to some of her male co-stars' good manners.
He continued: 'What are humans born with and what are they taught?
What are the media and society's ways of making boys feel that this is what they must be to be a man?
I think this is one of the key questions right now - how can we change this?
Because it's obvious that something is wrong with the boys.'
During the visit he also admitted that he would not be doing any Game of Thrones when the series ended this morning, saying, 'I've had enough of fighting and riding donkeys'.
From November Kit will be taking part in the reboot of the True West drama starring Sam Shepard about a filmmaker and his brother who is a burglar.
The actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing he had ever seen on Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the set, so I found my forever family and my whole life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who was in love with Jon Snow's real name Kit, in the Emmy-winning drama.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's parents' home in Scotland.
HIV and AIDS: China reports a 14 percent increase in the number of new cases
The country reported that the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
An estimated 820,000 people in the country are infected, health officials say.
The current attendance of 40,000 was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of these people were infected by sexual transmission, which led to a revolution.
HIV is initially spread widely in some areas through blood transfusions.
But the number of HIV infections through this route has been reduced dramatically, the Chinese health ministry said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of new HIV infections is increasing by 100,000 a year.
HIV transmission through sexual relations has become more common in homosexual relationships.
China's anti-gay laws were lifted in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals has increased in the country.
Because of the world's anti-gay culture, surveys have shown that about 70 to 90 percent of men who have had homosexual relationships eventually marry.
The greatest spread of the virus in these relationships is through unprotected sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide HIV-related assistance to everyone in an effort to eradicate the virus.
Maxine Waters denies that a worker leaked information about a Republican congressman, calling it "a blatant lie" and "a hoax".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters has denied reports that her office leaked confidential communications from three Republican lawmakers on the lawmakers' websites.
Waters, a Los Angeles Democrat, said the story was being spread by "individuals and websites" that are trying to defame people.
"This is a lie, a very bad lie", Waters said in a message on the game's Twitter page.
The leaked message included the addresses and telephone numbers of the following U.S. senators: Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The message was posted online Thursday on the Capitol Hill website by an unidentified source during the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, for attempted rape.
The message was released after the three councilors questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative party websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState also reported that the IP address identifying the site's origin was linked to the Waters office" and released information about the Waters employee, Hill said.
"This nonsense is a complete lie", Waters said.
"The staff at my office - whose name has been revealed and whose confidential and security information has been placed on the wall because of this story - is not the one who published the message.
This is a complete and utter lie".
Waters' comments have been criticized by several people online, including former White House Chief of Staff Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is a sign of anger", wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that he is not qualified to be a Member of Parliament.
If someone is falsely accused, there is no need to be angry.
They must not show contempt for authority.
They should not hate the motives of those who slander them.
He needs to be calm and calm".
Fleischer was apparently referring to Waters's remarks and criticism of the judges, Kavanaugh and the Democrats, who were criticized for responding angrily during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is seeking to remove Waters from the midterm elections, also took to Twitter.
"A very serious story, if it is true", he wrote on Twitter.
In his speech, Waters said his office notified "the appropriate authorities and the police about the matter.
"We will ensure that the people who spread this information are identified", he continued, "and that they are held accountable for their actions because they are dangerous and disturbing to everyone in my office".
The cover of Johnny English Strikes Again - Atkinson's uninspired spy comedy
It is now common to see the benefits of Brexit in every film in the British press and this is also the case in the events of another Jonny English film - it started in 2003 with Jonny English and returned in 2011 with a reboot of Jonny English Reborn.
Would a blunt and sarcastic comment on this point highlight the harm of making the world a commercial institution?
At any rate, the big-eyed, unknowing Johnny English had the knack of reinventing himself  to prove that he had the ability to make a non-English-speaking comedy that would reach a wide audience.
He is a major character who even pretends to be a comedian who is a police officer, and Bean and the British superhero who is the message of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The story is based on Atkinson's trip in an old Barclay's radio commercial, which caused a stir.
There are a couple of interesting scenes in this new Johnny English movie.
I admired Johnny English as he followed the plane in his old-fashioned safety vest and knives dangling from his hat.
Atkinson's comedic talent is evident, but his sense of humor is subtle and "amazingly" woven, especially considering the excellent humor of 007 and Mission Impossible.
His humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's roles are less artistic and steady than Atkinson's films in which he doesn't speak and he was like Bean.
As the opening paragraph of this article shows, Britain is in a very bad way.
Hackers broke into the British spyware and leaked information about all British soldiers stationed in different areas, causing a disturbance in the mind of a soldier stationed in another area - a minor part of Kevin Eldon's case.
It is the last act of a self-absorbed and troubled prime minister who sees a problem in her political disillusionment: Emma Thompson is playing the part of Teresa May in the drama but has nothing to add.
His wise advisers tell him that since every spy on the job has been compromised, he should remove someone from his position.
And this refers to Johnny English, a former high school principal who teaches a secret military course: the pope has good points, while English teaches various students about espionage.
English is rushed to a meeting in Whitehall for an emergency message and meets his longtime colleague, Bough, who is also picked up by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, married to a naval officer, a self-sacrificing part that Vicki Pepperdine has not used well.
So Batman and Robin, the misguided soldiers of the Emperor, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's daughter, the charming Ophelia Bulletova.
Now, the prime minister is distracted by the actions of a wealthy man who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their mission: pretending to be waiters at a public restaurant, they set fire to a French restaurant; this causes a commotion that leads to their boarding of the Volta high-speed train; and English causes a commotion when he tries to use a microphone to see what is inside the Volta house.
All the final scenes take place in the final scene, but as entertaining and immersive as it is, it makes for a children's film in every way.
A little fun.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't British filmmakers give Rowan Atinkson a role to explore his talents?
The Labour Party denies proposing a four-day workweek for British citizens, but only pays for five
Jeremy Corbyn's party has come up with a big idea that would see British citizens working four days a week - but getting paid five.
The party claims to want employers to share the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) with their employees by giving them an extra day off.
The plan would give workers three days off - but the same pay.
According to the press release, this idea may be "in line" with the economic ideology of the party and the ideology of changing the world in favor of the working class.
The shift to a four-day workweek was approved by the Labour Representatives as a way for workers to benefit from technological advances.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It is not possible to work one day but a four-day workweek is a good fit for the party's policies so that workers can benefit from economic progress and new business models.'
The Labor Party is not the first to make such a claim, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during the 2017 election.
However, this is not the view of all Labor Party members.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not part of the party's agenda.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of a Labour Party conference last week to offer his ideas on how to change how people can benefit from the economy of the country.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from the 'hopeless regulators' and 'profitable' of the aid industry.
The leader's policies also mean that water shareholders cannot recover all their money as the Labor government may make a 'discount' on some of the money for reasons they consider to be wrong.
He also confirmed the introduction of a scheme to enlist employees to pay a 10 per cent contribution, which would result in an annual salary of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the alleged case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by nearly a week, raising the question of whether the office's findings should sway any Republican senators from supporting him.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" television reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy spoke more candidly than his South Carolina counterpart.
"To be honest, that's it", said Kennedy.
"I'm going to the hearing", I said, "I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called out to him after this, and his words came out, saying, 'Have you done this?'
He was courageous, determined, unwavering".
Graham's vote, however, is clearly not going to be changed.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is unchanging and must be changed only in the case of a serious crime", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who mentions him can prove it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything that can change right now".
What is the International Festival of Musicians, and what has it done to alleviate poverty?
Next Saturday, New York City hosts the annual festival, where musicians from all over the world will sing a song with the common theme of ending global poverty.
This year's festival, which will be held for the seventh consecutive year, will draw thousands of visitors to Central Park Park to not only see the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to spread the word about the ultimate goal of the festival - ending poverty by 2030.
The International Music Festival, which began in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project's global effort to fight global poverty by increasing the number of people fighting poverty.
To get a ticket to the party (unless you are buying a ticket for a high-ranking person), the attendees have to perform various tasks or activities, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the head of state, calling a phone, or any other clever means of spreading the word about the cause of poverty.
But how far has the Festival progressed with 12 years to go before it reaches its goal?
Is free music streaming a legitimate way to get people to act or is it just another form of cyber warfare - people feeling like they're doing something superior by signing an online form or tweeting a message?
As of 2011, the Festival's organizers reportedly have collected 19 million promotional items from their followers.
They say that these events have helped to encourage world leaders to identify and plan for a $37 billion investment plan to help the 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 initiatives from its activities, of which $10 billion had already been funded or raised.
The organization's efforts have resulted in a change in the lives of 649 million people worldwide.
Other initiatives include the UK's Health Promotion, a "child development" campaign that pledged $35 million to Rwanda to fight childhood obesity, following 4,700 tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, the public good, international governments, and people like you, we can end obesity", said Tracey Ullman, a health advocate, to a London concert audience in April 2018.
The group also said that through over 5000 presentations the group was encouraged to urge the UK government to improve maternal and child health, and the government announced financial support for the programme which will benefit 5 million mothers and children.
In response to a question they received on their Web site that asked: What do you think can be done about poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a hard and long struggle - and at times we will be weakened and defeated.
But, like the liberation movements of that time, we too will achieve our goals because unity is strength.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will entertain the crowd at the New York City festival, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use military force to "stop" Russia from exporting energy - Foreign Minister
The United States will use its naval forces "if necessary" to block the export of Russian minerals and energy to various countries, including Asia, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, according to reports in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's activities in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the country's legitimate government - are a false way to gain market and power.
"I believe that the Russian government has sent its agents to Asia to find a market for its power, as it does in Eastern Europe", he said.
And, he added, there are ways to address this.
"America has the capability that, with our Navy, we can open the gates and if necessary block their market access", he said.
Zinke says so in a speech organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in America.
He said that Washington's war against Russia would be similar to that against Iran, saying that it would have a common goal.
"The economic strategy of Russia and Iran, in the same way, is to develop and transform oil", he said, comparing Russia to a "profit-making entity" on oil.
This comes as the Trump administration is in the midst of a push to boost its oil trade with Europe, replacing Russia's cheaper oil.
In response, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, have been trying to force Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 deal with Russia, which Trump said made Germany a "slave" of Russia".
Russia has insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which is to expand its capacity to 110 billion cubic meters by the length and width, is purely economic.
Russia has long claimed that the U.S. is opposed to the program for economic reasons and that the policy is an example of economic oppression.
"I believe we agree that energy trade should not be a threat and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose who to sell energy to", Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. policy was not to Germany's liking, and Germany insisted on its continued cooperation with the program.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States to stay out of the European energy alliance and the German-Russian alliance.
"I am very disappointed when foreign interference in our energy purchases", said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI, after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to consider "seriously" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Representative says
Massachusetts Representative Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously" consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a convention in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren made a decision to consider participation.
Warren responded that it was time "for the mother to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that included the first lady", according to The Hill.
"After November 6, he wants to "consider seriously" the issue of running for president".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at the summit, saying that he was "taking the region in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was at the forefront of the criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nominations.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A statement released on Thursday showed that most of Warren County residents do not think it is appropriate to run in 2020.
Ninety-eight percent of the "able" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not participate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe union.
Thirty-two percent agreed with the statement of participation.
The poll shows that the majority of people agree that former Governor Deval Patrick should participate, with 38 percent supporting the possibility and 48 percent opposed.
Some of the most prominent Democratic candidates being discussed for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a good decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about the PTSD of Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in Sept.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
"What my son went through, what he went through on his return, I can understand other families affected by PTSD and some of the things our military is going through", she told an audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest "a big deal that nobody wants to talk about" and of her son and other veterans, "they come back slightly changed, come back strong, come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and employees, and every other member of the military, has contributed to this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman, obstructing a domestic violence investigation and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. oppose new refugee protection law
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are protesting a new U.S. law that denies assistance to people fleeing terrorism and domestic violence.
Lawyers from 18 states and territories on Friday filed a lawsuit in Washington state court on behalf of a refugee asylum seeker who is also protesting the law, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She claimed that her husband "and a gang of his sons, a gang of thugs", were abusing her but US authorities denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Lawyers who represented Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which bring the largest number of asylum seekers to the U.S., as countries experiencing the greatest problems from gang violence and domestic violence.
The new US law on the protection of refugees from terrorism overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allows undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to claim protection.
Chief Judge Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said Friday in a statement that the law "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law".
"The law requires that all refugee complaints about threats be judged on the facts and circumstances, and such a ban is a violation of the law", said lawyers.
Lawyers also briefly argued that the ban on immigration could be harmful to the U.S. economy, saying immigrants could be both businessmen and "essential workers".
In mid-June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Protection is granted to those who have been forced to leave their homes because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", the Court said in its ruling on June 11.
Providing security did not mean solving all the problems - even the most serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Emergency rescue efforts are underway in Palu to find survivors as the death toll doubles
For the survivors, things are getting worse.
"It's getting very difficult", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her son with malaria at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
An ambulance brings in dead bodies every minute.
Clean water is not readily available.
People are seen returning to their destroyed homes, carrying their belongings through the floodwaters, trying to salvage whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were unable to cope with the demand.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors as other strong quakes were continuing.
Tears filled his eyes as he related the powerful earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
They pushed me through the rubble of the wall, and I thought I would", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding ceremony.
I heard my wife cry for help, and there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope he's all right".
The United States has accused China of 'disturbing' 'commercial messages'
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. newspaper criticizing the U.S.-China trade agreement, the U.S. ambassador to China said China was using the American newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a special report on the Des Moines Register - a major newspaper in Iowa, which was bought by a Chinese newspaper - following the president's accusation that China was trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. election, a charge China denies.
According to Reuters, the US president's impeachment trial against Trump for the US election marked a new US campaign against China.
Although some foreign media advertising is legal, China and the United States have a trade dispute, which has led to high tariffs on domestic products.
The tariffs imposed by China on American goods were aimed at Iowa businessmen who are affiliated with Trump's Republican Party, say Sino-American analysts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and mayor of Iowa, which exports most of its agricultural products to China, said China's actions hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
"China is making a big deal out of this mess by putting fake ads in our own newspapers", Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register.
"In spreading its lies, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the free speech and press freedoms that America prides itself on by paying for advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a street newspaper shop here in Beijing, you will find few critical comments and you will not see any light shining on the Chinese people's economic problems in China, since the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
Without naming his newspaper, he added that "one of China's leading newspapers has turned down the opportunity to publish" his story.
Republican Party favours women voters in Kavanaugh scandal, researchers warn
While most Republican leaders support Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for Supreme Court justice despite Kavanaugh's alleged attempted rape, experts say this will cause problems, especially from women in the upcoming election.
The case has sparked outrage, and the Republican Party has publicly stated that it is ready to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination.
These things cannot be undone", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an interview with The Hill newspaper in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that the push for an FBI investigation by Arizona State Senator Jeff Flake's time-lapse would ease voter anger.
"Mothers can't forget yesterday - they can't forget tomorrow or November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, the female executive director of the women's group MoveOn, on Friday, according to a Washington DC newspaper report.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted November is coming! as they marched through the lobby of the House of Representatives when Republican lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Interest in democracy is declining", said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst.
"People say the interest has been high; it is true.
But it could be higher especially among women in urban areas and young people between 18 and 29 years of age who are eligible to vote, who, while not in favor of the president, do not vote".
Even before Ford's evidence of Kavanaugh's rape attempt was made public, experts said that if the Republican Party could confirm Kavanaugh's nomination, there would be a lot of anger.
"This has shown the GOP to be a bad party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC news reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh's confirmation as a Supreme Court justice, but also the way the Republican Party has handled the case and how it has handled her", Guy Cecil, director of American Interest, a Democratic campaign group, told the newspaper.
On the other hand, the American public seems divided on who to trust based on the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, and the majority is in favor of Kavanaugh.
A new YoGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents trusted Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said they trusted Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said Ford lied in his testimony.
Following Flake's claims, the FBI is investigating the case reported by Ford and Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Ford testified before the House Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had been a drunken rapist when he was 17.
Ramirez said Kavanaugh showed her his private parts at a party when he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to create a rival website to rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is developing a website that will compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The researcher's new project, called Inrupt, is a company that aims to continue where the Solid software re-engineered by Berner-Lee has stopped.
The Solid page allows users to choose where to store their content and allows them to choose which content they want people to view.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that Inrupt's goal is "to beat everyone".
"We have to do it now", he said of the site.
"It is wonderful news".
The app will use Solid's software capabilities to allow people to create their own "online storage portion" or POD.
The program can store, schedule, calendar, music, and other personal and business information.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all combined at once.
A unique feature of the privacy software is that the user can choose who can see what he or she wants.
The company describes the launch as "a message of encouragement".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, our vision for Inrupt is to bring the right products, processes and technologies that will make Solid available to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security contractor IBM, other computer workers hired to develop the software, and a variety of skilled volunteers.
Starting this week, computer scientists around the world have been able to create their own software using tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his colleagues are not in touch with the owners of "Facebook and Google about whether or not to make any major changes that would temporarily shut down all their networks.
"We do not ask their permission".
In a blog post on Medium posted on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's goal is to provide a business and environmental impact statement to protect the technology and benefits of new software from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he launched his website, the World Wide Web, at a Massachusetts engineering school.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been speaking out in the debate over the need for collaborative web design.
Even after founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee would remain the owner and chief executive officer of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I have high hopes for this new software", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: A pastor who received the Victoria Cross after fighting in World War I is celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to earn the Victoria Cross during the Civil War as a soldier is celebrated in his hometown even a century later.
The star was discovered on September 29, 1918, by the Reverend Lt. Col. Bernard Vann at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a secret agent, unaware that he had attained the highest rank in the British army.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two sons on a plaque in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "a great achievement" for the stone to be displayed a century after his grandfather's discovery.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, Lt. Col. Vann led his troops across the Saint-Quentin River "in fog and under heavy shelling from a sawed-off shotgun and a machine gun".
Then he hurried forward and "subtly" and alone led his soldiers to take a shotgun and kill three battalions.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by German intelligence on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's example was "something I know I can't do but it teaches us humility".
He and his brother Dr James Vann planted the wreath after the peloton, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he felt "honored to be part of the peloton" and added that "the courage of the monkeys is reflected in the many monuments to them".
MMA fans didn't sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206, instead they were shown Peppa Pig
Imagine, you didn't stay up all night to watch the giant Bellator 206 play and then end up not being shown.
The program from San Jose featured 13 debates, including six on the main card and was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, UK viewers were surprised when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed that they had stayed up late, especially in anticipation of the fight.
One Twitter user described the adaptation of the program into a children's cartoon as "just a joke".
"It is a state policy that at 6 a.m. this was not to be shown so they had to change it to a children's show", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's deputy director of marketing and communications, when asked about the matter.
""Please pig", yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would be reviewing their programming to include UK viewers in the future.
We're thinking about repeating the program, and I think maybe we can do that", Coker said.
"But it's 6 o'clock Sunday morning there and we can't do this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work hard to make things work.
To be sure, the moment it happened was a moment of great excitement and uncertainty.
We worked hard to fix it, thinking it was a mechanical problem.
But no, it was a matter of state.
I promise that will never happen again.
We'll be preparing five fights instead of six - as we do - and we tried to feed our fans more and more and just missed the mark in doing so.
It's very difficult".
Desert Island cable talk: Tom Daley 'hides' from his favorite group
An Olympic champion swimmer grew up hiding from his favorite group, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old researcher says that she did not realize until she was in high school that "everyone is not like me".
Speaking on the first of four interviews on Desert Island, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was speaking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less focused on his sport.
The host, Kirsty Young, has been out of the program for several months because of illness.
Speaking on Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up she felt "backward" because "it was not acceptable to be attracted to both boys and girls".
"To this day", he says, "the feeling of inferiority and the feeling of being different have been the motivators and the strengthens that have kept me going".
He wanted to show people that he was "one of them", he said, so that no one would be disappointed if they learned about his favorite group.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known gay rights activist and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on many countries to legalize same-sex marriage.
He said he spoke because he felt that he was fortunate to remain free despite his confessed love of his fellow-travellers and wanted to provide "an encouragement" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American actor Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "shocked me".
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years her senior, last year but says the difference is only a matter of time.
"When you have a lot of things going on at this age"  she went to the Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find someone who had faced the challenges she faced.
In June the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that "their outlook" changed.
"If you ask me last year, I'm thinking about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But you know what? There are more things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was dying and that one of the questions he asked before he died was whether their tickets for the 2012 London Olympics were available - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I would not have told them that you would not be in the front because you would be dead", he said.
"I held her hand as she died and it was only when she died that I realized that she was not eternal", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew this was my dream - to dive in front of people at the Olympics, and there was nothing better", he said.
This also fueled her first musical choice - Proud by Heather Small - which inspired her in preparation for the Olympics and continues to inspire her.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, whose performance was down, was left out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson of the United States has been making history Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup game but he needs to play more than he has in the middle to avoid a disappointing record.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th World Cup in two years, was sent off and replaced by manager Jim Furyk in a four-man match.
Instead of being one of the players on the day, the five-time American champion is simply cheering for his teammates and preparing to improve his game.
The 48-year-old, who was not a particularly dangerous player in his prime, is not the right player for the challenging Le Golf National Cup where long-distance balls are a pain in the ass.
And if the race is not too dangerous, Mickelson will face British champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has played alongside Tommy Fleetwood, the newest player in the cup and has won four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in their first 12 games, can play well, Mickelson's play could be of great value.
Furyk said that he trusted the expert, but he did not say much.
"He understood what he had to do today, complimented me and hugged me and told me that he was ready for the next game", Furyk said.
"He is self-reliant.
He is a seasoned professional who has done a lot for the team in the past, and this week.
I don't expect him to play two games.
I expected him to play a lot of games, but that's just the way it turned out, and that's the way we felt we should have done it.
He wants to play like everyone else".
At Sunday's game Mickleson beat Nick Faldo in the Ryder Cup.
This will result in a game-play that is also unlike the one he plays alone.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven, yet Furyk says his presence strengthens his team.
"He is fun, sarcastic, funny, and sociable, and a good person to be around", she explained.
"I think the younger players were happy to play with him, this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just to play".
European team manager Thomas Bjorn knows that his lead may be over
Thomas Bjorn knows from past experience that his lead in the Ryder Cup singles event can easily turn into a difficult defense.
The Danish player played his first match in Valderrama in 1999, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the American team but managed to win by a narrow 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a strong lead at Valderrama; we had a strong lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but by a few points", Bjorn said, after watching a good team in 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead in the Le Golf National.
So history teaches me and everyone on this team that the game is not over.
We must persevere.
Let's go to the theater and do well.
The game did not end until we had scored the most points.
We have a goal - to try to win the cup - and this is where we should focus our attention.
I've always said that I'm interested in the 12 players on our team, and we know the players we're playing against - the best players in the world".
Enthusiastic about how his players played competitively on a difficult golf course, Bjorn said: "I can't feel alone.
Tomorrow's game is another.
Tomorrow, each person's skills will be revealed, and this is a difficult task.
It is good to play with a friend when things are going well, but playing alone, as golfers do, is a real test.
The message to the players is to be a man yourself for tomorrow's game.
Here, you leave your playmate and he has to do his own thing".
Unlike Bjorn's team, Jim Furyk will want his players to be more consistent than they were playing in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three of the four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the revolution, as he was on the team that won at Brookline before becoming the team that lost when the European team "did the miracles" at Medinah".
"I remember everything", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, encouraged his players on the final day of the game.
"We have 12 important games but we have to get up early as you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When this happens in one, the midfielders are stressed.
We've got our game in order and we've got our players in order and we want to do something amazing tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with starting the team's down-line and will play Rory Mcllroy in the big leagues, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will play the European team based on the European roster.
"I put these players in this position because I believe they will help us to the end", he said of his selection of players in individual events.
The German submarine program is updated
The new German Navy was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace the old Navy's submarine, but the ship will not enter service until next year due to a breakdown in the program and fluctuating costs, the German newspaper said.
According to reports by Die Zeit following an interview with a military spokesman, the launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class railway, has now been postponed to the first quarter of 2019.
The train was scheduled to enter military service in 2014 but the difficulties caused by the delay in its launch.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class trains purchased in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class trains.
We hear that these ships are equipped with powerful guns, tankers, and other advanced technology, including stealth aircraft.
Another advantage is that the ships can be operated for a long time before being repaired - they can be used off our ports for up to two years.
However, the delay in the launch of the trains - which would have changed the German system in other countries - means that they will be available only after the trains have been retired, says Die Zeit.
The refusal to build the F125 became public last year when the German Navy refused to build it and sent it back to the Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was not the first time that the ships had been returned to the shipyard.
The reasons for the return were unclear, but German newspapers reported that there were "problems with the necessary software and materials" on board that made the ship useless once it was in service.
The complexity of the program was a major factor, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class trains are expected to carry 120 people - half the number of soldiers on the old Bremen class trains.
Moreover, it was discovered that the ships were too heavy to operate efficiently and that the military needed to improve their efficiency.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ships weighed 7,000 tons - twice the weight of the ships used by the German army in World War II.
Apart from the technical flaws, the cost of the entire operation - including training the sailors - is disruptive.
It is reported that its budget reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the €2.2 billion originally budgeted.
The problems with these ships are becoming more serious as the German navy's technology is reportedly declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the parliamentary security committee in Germany, admitted that the soldiers were "missing the boat".
He said that the reason for the delay was that the old ships were no longer in service and the replacement ships were not being supplied.
He found that there was no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship for the German Navy.
The National Trust surveys the lives of bats
A new study in a house in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use geography to hunt for food.
Hopefully, the findings will shed new light on these unique birds and help to improve future conservation efforts.
Research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will focus on the well-known species and the soprano pipistrelles as well as the long-headed brown bat and Daubenton bat species at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed around the site to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct surveys on a walk-in basis using mobile screening devices.
Experimental sound recordings will reveal the size and nature of the bats.
A map of the reporting area can also be made to provide information about the location and behavior of the reporting area.
Rob Dewar, a security consultant at NTS, believes the results will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This will help to understand the value of conservation efforts such as planting a good grass and how to care for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen dramatically in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect the way bats congregate for daytime rest and the loss of their habitat.
Wind and light can also pose a danger, as can fly-trapping paper and other building materials, and cat food.
The tongue is not blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated system to detect insects and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 valuable farms and 76,000 hectares [1,400 acres] throughout the country, considers bats to be of great importance.
It has ten highly trained experts, who often conduct research, monitor bat breeding grounds during the day, and occasionally perform rescue operations.
The Society has also established one and only bat sanctuary in Scortland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, the manager, says that this is the perfect location for them.
"Here in Threave we have the best bat habitat", he said.
"We have old houses, many old trees, and all the good land.
But there is still a lot that is unknown about bats, so our work here and at other facilities will help us to understand more about what they need to survive".
He also stressed the importance of checking for bats before repairing a house because destroying one of the bat's breeding grounds could kill 400 female bats and their young, and this could kill all the bats in the area.
The milim is protected and is not allowed to kill, torture or disturb or destroy its habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's director of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to join in.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats", he says, "and many of our species are still in the dark".
Ronaldo's denial of rape has led his lawyers to threaten to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the charge of rape is "false news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers planned to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the case.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was reportedly paid $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say, 'No, no, no, no.
What he said today, is a lie", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said through a camera.
"They want to exalt themselves in my name.
It is not unusual
They want to be known by my name, but that's the kind of work.
I am a happy and good person", the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers plan to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they say are "unconstitutional reports on suspected privacy issues", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player could claim compensation for the defamation of his character to the extent of the case, which should be the most serious defamation of a person in recent years".
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt after his remarks and told him that he was "99%" "a good person" who failed "only 1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but it was done after a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police where pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to resolve the matter on her own because she felt she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to change her decision to handle the matter on her own as she continues to be hurt by what she claims happened.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he moved to Juve, Italy's biggest club, in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' for the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its position as the world's number one car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He also said it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it could temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need unity", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer warned that delays at the border if no agreement on Brexit is reached could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models - produced about 150,000 vehicles last year with 90% exported to other European Union countries.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we could see production cease at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have expressed fears over the prospect of leaving the EU without agreement on how international sales and purchases will be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
A major concern for car manufacturers is what they say is the uncertainty of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota manufactures its vehicles "at the request" of its customers, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for cars produced at the request of customers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border disruptions that industry claims could cause delays and shortages in automotive production.
It would be impossible for Toyota to produce a day's worth of products at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production could be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union "is precisely designed to avoid delays at the border".
"We want to have a partnership. We want to have a very good partnership that will allow as I say not just a matter of winning at the moment but to take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with the successful approach of delivering products to consumers".
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but over time, it suggested that the additional pay could reduce the factory's sales rate against other factories and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and Unite union organizer, says that his members are deeply concerned: "In my case, once the jobs are gone, they never come back.
"We have established a clear and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU", said a government spokesman.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, say White House officials
A meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed by another week" as the battle against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House officials said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump supporters and Russia and the President's potential interference with justice.
The question of whether Trump would fire the attorney general, thus undermining Mueller's rights, has been a source of heated debate in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed installing a recording device to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, where there were reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he "would not want" to remove Rosenstein from office but then the meeting was delayed to coincide with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of his female sexual assault defendants, Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate for a week the charges against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date for this has not been set, it could be this week, I can see it is delayed by another week in view of all the other proceedings by the high court.
But we'll see how it goes and I like the media to be informed about the latest news".
Some media outlets may object: Sanders has not had a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the decline in the rallies was not due to a "TV" media's "popularity" bias, though he added: "I can't deny the fact that they are popular".
He then said direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president who has ever lived", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers".
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to question the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more and you've seen us do this for the last few weeks and this will be done instead of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States directly".
Trump is always available to answer questions when he leaves the White House or when he is in a meeting or conversation with dignitaries.
Private press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president may have shown his reasons, making a free and sometimes unexpected appearance in front of a gathering of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU NHS Scotland staff over Brexit fears
The health secretary has written to EU staff at Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and wishes for them to stay on Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to making it possible to pay the application fee to EU citizens who work for it.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "This summer, talks between the UK and the EU on leaving are still ongoing, with the hope that elections will be held by the end of this rainy season.
But the UK Government also urged preparations for a no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contributions of every worker, regardless of their background.
Friends from all over the EU, and beyond, come as experts who are instrumental in improving health services, as well as helping patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home for good and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie Surgically Rescued from a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after a head injury Saturday when his team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commondores, Tennessee reporter Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred in the first half.
"He came to a side and then passed out", Reed said.
Teachers and doctors put Abercrombie on oxygen on the courtyard just before he was put on a chest tube and taken to the hospital for further examination.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the precise nature of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee is investigating the timing of the injury.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, plays for Tennessee State for the first time since coming from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he had blocked and knocked down five times, bringing his total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher taxes when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes when buying property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
The idea would undermine the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young people to vote for him
Additional taxes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Economists hope to raise £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay higher taxes when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The idea appears to undermine the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract younger voters with promises of affordable housing and better pay.
Additional taxes will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional funding will support the Government's policy to tackle the problem of sleeping under bridges.
The additional - which includes the current taxes, plus the higher rates introduced two years ago on older homes and rental properties - could be as much as 3 percent.
Economists expect to earn 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to make the first move into a home.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially the inner city - have become "desolate villages" because of the influx of foreign buyers who spend long periods abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson announced that tax cuts would be needed to help more young people get their first home.
She blamed large construction companies for raising house prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up her stake in cheap housing to address Britain's "housing scandal".
Corbyn has announced a series of ambitious new housing plans, which include rent controls and a "no-fault" cancellation.
They also want to give the councils more power to build new buildings.
"Last year I said I would give my first priority to rebuilding the British dream - to make life better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a better life here.
However, it would be inaccurate to say that it is as easy for non-UK residents, as for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hardworking British citizens.
For many people, having a home is a dream, and sleeping under bridges is still a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to coach the Scotland team
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says that his "main goal" is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old, who was born in Scotland, is enjoying a successful re-election campaign for the North-East club, who are currently third in League One, three points down.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B rating and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up supporting Scotland in Hampden very much with my father as a child, and it always reminds me of the past.
The opportunity will come, only if I manage the clubs well".
Ross' first spells as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to follow the big names in such a big club, having turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment will be determined by the answer to the question ' can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
"The design and facilities of the club are obviously Premier League", he said.
"It's a lot of work to get there, but I feel like a winner with this club if I can get it back there".
Ross has only spent three years in his managerial role, having spent a long time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell as a regular in the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier, and helped St Mirren club narrowly miss out on winning the Championship.
And Ross says he feels better now than he did when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Maybe it was time to make a big decision", he recalled, about coaching the Alloa club.
"I really believed that the supervisory work was right for me, more than the acting.
It sounds strange because I've done well, I have a good job, and I enjoy other things.
But playing can be challenging.
You have a lot to do each week.
I continue to be stressed and pressured by work but the management job is the best for me.
I always wanted to be in charge, and now that I am, I feel better than I have in all my adult life".

The best time to drink alcohol is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research shows
The summer heat has benefited Britain's struggling brewing industry but has also caused a lot of problems for restaurants.
Alcoholic beverage retailers saw a 2.7% increase in alcohol sales in July - but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who also compiles the figures, said: "The continuing heat and England's unexpected long-term participation in the World Cup will make July's activity similar to that of June, when beer sales saw a 2.8 per cent increase, with the exception of restaurants which suffered the most.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June continued in July.
Both liquor and beer stores perform better than restaurants.
Food and beverage businesses also suffered during the summer, although they did not suffer as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out and drink.
Well-managed liquor sales saw a 6.6 percent increase in the same month, and food sales fell by 3 percent".
Paul Newman, of RSM's leisure and hospitality department, said: "This trend continues on what we have seen since late April.
Changes in weather and social or sporting activities have a major impact on outdoor shopping.
Not surprisingly, the restaurant industry continues to struggle, and the 4.8 percent annual decline in sales is a major problem, especially with the rising demands.
The long hot summer may not be the best time for the food business and the passage of time will show whether the cold weather we experienced in August will provide the needed relief".
Sales in liquor stores and restaurants, including recently opened businesses, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new product launches.
Coffer Peach Tracker is responsible for researching UK beer and restaurant businesses and collects and analyses transactions from 47 groups, with a combined turnover of $9 billion, and their results are highly reliable.
1 in 5 children has a private social media account that they hide from their parents
1 in 5 children - some under 11 - have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the number of fake Insta accounts.
This article added to the fear of pornography being sent
Twenty percent of students said they had a large account showing their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a high number of fake Insta accounts - according to a website in the context of Instagram photo sharing.
This article added to the fear of pornography being sent
Twenty percent of the students said they had a white big account showing their parents, but also had some secrets.
A mother who had access to the private account of her 13-year-old daughter noticed that the teenage girl was encouraging others to rape her.
A survey, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two accounts, with half of them admitting to keeping accounts private.
"It is disturbing that so many young people are being tempted to create social networks without the knowledge of their parents and teachers", says HMC executive director Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle to be "voice of athletes" at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle and Scottish top speed skater and racing champion and chairman Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for the sport's organisers to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past 10 years.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, UK and international athletic community and we believe that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from bringing him to the team", Beattie said.
Doyle said: I want to be the voice of the sport and I hope to really help and promote the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Games among four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC celebrity, was left paralyzed after a drug overdose.
He wrote on Twitter: "Last month I had a stroke.
I cannot walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or not.
It was a hard task, but I recovered, now I can walk again, and today I am running fast!
Thank you for the encouraging message!
An advertisement for a milk pump that compares women to dairy cows has caused a lot of comments on the Internet
A company that makes milk pumps has been the subject of a number of online reviews and advertisements that compare nursing mothers to milk cows being milked.
To "start" a quietly working pump, Elvie has released a music video with a comedy about the freedom that the pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers in a cowshed with grass dance to a song with the words: "Yes, I'm down, but you can't see the tail" and "if you didn't realize that these aren't cow's breasts, they're my real breasts".
The song went on: "Pump, pump, I'm nursing the children, pump, pump, I'm kissing my mothers".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a stir on the internet.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reviews from viewers, many saying it shows the "bad side" of the dairy industry.
It is a very bad idea to use dairy cows to advertise these machines.
Like us they must conceive and give birth to produce milk, unless their young are weaned within days of birth", wrote one.
Elvie's breast pump fits nicely inside the breastplate (Elvie / Mother)
Another said: "It's a tragedy for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who are breastfeeding their babies?"
Another added: "Such inconsistent advertising".
Some liked the ad, with one woman admitting that the song is "funny"
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have had one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little inappropriate but I am not angry about it.
This is wise", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fascinating advertisement about mothers who suckle (usually at work or in the toilet) and feel like "milk cows".
This is not a complimentary advertisement or a criticism of dairy companies".
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that all the dancers have these secret pumps.
The advertising idea is based on the understanding that many nursing mothers say they feel like dairy cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, works quietly, has no wires or tubes and fits comfortably in a breastplate, giving mothers the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go elsewhere while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother added: "Elvie Pump is a new product so it needs to be introduced with care and fun.
By comparing the similarities between mothers and dairy cows we wanted to make the issue of breast-feeding and its complications clear, and to present in a fun and easy-to-remember way the freedom that this new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on a show by designer Marta Jakubowski using this pump.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Smuggle to a Texas Border Camp
The number of immigrant children has increased despite the monthly border crossing being unchanged, perhaps because of the negative attitudes and policies of the Trump administration that have made it difficult to provide children to caregivers.
Traditionally, many foster parents have moved abroad without proper papers, and they fear that they will lose their right to stay in the country by coming to look for a foster child.
The situation escalated in June, when officials announced that asylum seekers and other elderly family members would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the same would be shared with border control officials.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had registered to help these unaccompanied children.
The agency later determined that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are being helped or their family members are in the country illegally, and many of these people are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we continue to search for these people", says Albence.
To speed up the process, authorities have enacted new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of their custody, not 60 days, as was previously the case, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through television, rather than a direct channel, in presenting their petition to the immigration judge.
Those who may be deemed unworthy of assistance will be promptly returned to their homeland.
Children who spend long periods in tents are more likely to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violence or flight, according to shelter workers and reports that have surfaced in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said the complaints were particularly high in a large area like Tornillo, where the signs of child abuse are often ignored, due to the size of such an area.
They added that bringing children to camp without giving them enough time to prepare their hearts or to say goodbye to friends can cause the emotional trauma that many already suffer.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish 'invasion forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's civil war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign troops were in the country illegally, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be punished accordingly".
"It must go away quickly without any further comment", the assembly said.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He also said that Damascus would continue "to fight this holy war until we have removed all the territory of Syria" from all terrorist groups and "illegal foreign visitors".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on duty in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the situation was good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unnecessary fear" that made the refugees unwilling to return.
"We have appealed to international and humanitarian agencies to help those who want to return", he said.
"They are politically involved in a matter that should be a public interest".
The United States and the European Union have said that no more aid will be given to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the rebels is reached to end the conflict.
The UN ambassador says the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe haven in the last major rebel-held area of Idlib has provided an opportunity to resume political talks.
The Russian-Turkish alliance has prevented further attacks on civilians by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the region, which has a population of three million.
Moualem, however, insisted that the alliance "has a deadline" and expressed hope that the military will only target jihadist groups, including Nusra Front fighters affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who will be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to convene the first meetings of a newly formed committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and establish a framework for a smooth election.
Moualem explained the role of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the task of the committee should be to "review the current constitutional text of the country", and warn those who want to disrupt the process.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
With that in mind, Trump will be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, as many observers expect, justice and crime end his presidency prematurely.
In what would be like "The most amazing end to leadership ever!"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, nighttime viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average nighttime program viewership of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the most long-running shows with 3.5 million viewers on a prime-time night.
"This is a problem that people are being brought into because it's not what we understand", said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes President after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another idea
She recalls the time she took a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
She said", Because they make me laugh"," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is something interesting about this.
In fact, unlike anything else coming on TV, the news from Washington could tell the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the global economic health.
Stopping is a valuable experience for lucky viewers.
And, it goes on to become a well-informed citizen if you find in a six-hour panel discussion of how Bob Woodward uses "deep history" to find his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a dress full of super-pride", the Washington Post reported) and the meaning of Stormy Daniels's scientifically-based description of the abusive body parts of Mr. Trump, um.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario again.
"One of the things they do that makes it look like a reality show is that they give you something to watch every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on Trump's recurring shows and daily activities (deciding on a war with the NFL, a nod to Kim Jong-un).
If you miss one section, you're out.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on northern Kauai, but he was too busy inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN news.
He couldn't stop watching, not with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony about his upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee hearing and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did all the crazy shows back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me to say.
"I thought it was just a joke, but it's obviously true".

Large sums of money are spent on midterm elections
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a lot of spending, thanks to the reorganization of legislative districts that allowed two candidates to run for the same seat.
The recent revamp of the Pittsburg County map allows Democratic candidate Conor Lamb to run - who also won his seat in another district in a recent special election.
Lamb is in contention with fellow Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is closely tied to the new 17th district.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been changed in favor of the Republican Party.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a massive campaign spending between the major economic groups, the Democratic Campaign DRM Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb name became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the highly-watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The state has been a Republican-held state for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the state by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a narrow margin of victory.
U.S. Tried to Punish El Salvador for Helping China, Then Retreated
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already begun working with Beijing, without much restriction from Washington.
Trump had a romantic meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until his colleagues removed the Trump Administration.
The State Department decided to recall the American ambassadors working in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to "recent elections to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions are only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in donations from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The sanctions, which include a moratorium on financial aid and visa exemptions, would have been especially harsh for the Central American country, which has a high unemployment rate and a high crime rate.
While internal meetings were in progress, North and Central American officials postponed a conference in anticipation of a later one that discussed security and economic issues following the same conference last year that was seen as a step forward in dealing with immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the negotiating authorities expressed their desire for the conference to go ahead, immediately dropping any suggestion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now preparing for talks at the summit, now scheduled for mid-October, underscoring the importance of the summit, the ambassadors said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the objections expressed by three US officials, including two ambassadors, who agreed to hold internal talks in a confidential manner.
Their accounts were verified by an outside expert close to the administration and reported in a confidential manner.
Learning From the Past
The next major news event could be the release of Robert Mueller's report on Trump's obstruction of justice, which now has clear evidence in public records.
Mueller says he is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in interfering with our election process.
If Congress changes leadership, Trump will find himself facing questions to answer to that body, as he plans to meet again with voters, and perhaps eventually a peer jury.
There are many questions to be answered, and I do not mean that Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor is that of his European counterparts.
There are choices that all of us in all parts of the US can make that will affect the duration of this war.
In 1938, German officials were ready to plot against Hitler, provided the West rejected him and supported the Czechoslovak citizens in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the terrible years that followed.
What happened in the past was done through this unique history, and the process of democracy can be accelerated or delayed by this.
Americans are experiencing several of these conditions right now.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who oversaw the Mueller investigation?
Last year, Rosenstein was in serious trouble since the paper also reported that he had proposed a secret presidential interview and that the president was unfit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
"What if the recent request to the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's case is insufficient or unfair - or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice despite ample evidence of rape and lying?
And most important, will we vote for lawmakers who will hold Trump accountable for his crimes?
If we fail this test, democracy will take a long time to come.
But I hope that we will not fail, thanks to the training I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied my former embassy.
He survived and moved to the United States, and some 60 years later, I was sent to light a Sabbath candle on a swastika table.
With such an inheritance, how can I be without hope for our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans believes he can do well in his team's match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, following their draw with Spanish side Villarreal earlier this month, Rangers are expected to beat the Australian side, giving them a chance to advance to the Europa League second qualifying round in Group G.
A knee injury to midfielder Graham Dorrans kept him out of his first game of the season until the day he equalised with Villarrea 2-2 but he believes the Rangers can use his performance as a good start to great things.
"The point we scored was important for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game confident that we could do well in the game and scored one point.
We may have won the game in the end, but in the end, the match was a good one.
They did well in the first half and we did well in the second half and we were the best team that day.
Thursday is a big game in the UEFA championship.
Fortunately, we can get all three points but it will be a very difficult game because they won the game but we have to take our home champions and I believe we can stand up and win the game.
Last year was a difficult one, especially with my injury and other changes in the team, but things are looking up.
The players are fine and the boys are having fun; the preparations are good.
Maybe, we can plant it now, forget about the past season and do better".
Women sleep late because they worry about how they will make money after retirement
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how to seek care, few people discussed this with their family.
Nearly half of those surveyed in Nationwide said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can get started.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you properly if you do not give your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you should receive care, as those choices may be important in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to find a way to pay the bill.
Your preferred source of long-term care funding may include traditional long-term care insurance, expensive mixed-use life insurance to cover these costs or self-insurance with your assets - as long as you have the funds.
Write your legal documents: Fight legal battles on the way.
Get a health care professional on your behalf to appoint a trusted person to manage your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you cannot speak.
Also, consider involving a lawyer in your financial matters.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your debts are paid if you cannot afford them.
A simple reminder: Your aging parents are in critical condition and are in the hospital.
Can you answer questions about health and medical conditions?
Write down the details so that you are prepared:
"It's not just the money that needs to be fixed, but who are the doctors? " asked Martin.
"What is the cure?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for that.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the failure of the communications system, emergency officials were unable to receive information from Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closest to the magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here is a brief overview of Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is the largest city in Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a small coastal plain on the western side of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake.
Donggala is a region stretching over 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northwest tip of Sulawesi Island.
The district, which is under the county, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are important to the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel is also mined in the province, but it is mainly found in Morowali, a coastal area facing Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunami disasters in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes are common.
Here is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake off the western coast of Aceh, Indonesia, north of Sumatra on December 26 sparked a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them Acehans.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and causes a 10-meter-long tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people are reminded of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami erupted during this period, but more than 100 were killed by the houses that fell on them.
2018: A massive earthquake hit Indonesia's largest tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of visitors temporarily in distress.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, tampering with a report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crimes, the phone was taken from her.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, honestly" after being questioned, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means she faces a prison sentence of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Senior Court
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with a report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
His girlfriend says he was punched in the face.
In 2016 Sarah Palin was criticized by senior military officials after linking her son's abuse to PTSD that she claimed was caused by her service as a soldier in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, on Friday
A magnitude 7.5 quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck in the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
The videos shared on social media show the real-time nature of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek unusual death sentences for NYC terrorism suspects
New York City jurors want Sayfullo Saipov to receive the death penalty, in which he is charged with terrorism in NYC and eight murders - a rare verdict not handed down by a federal court since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented car from Home Depot to commit a bicycle-related terrorist attack on a bike lane near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on the road in October.
In support of the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight and "deliberately" seriously injured others, according to the order on appeal of the sentence, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both cases carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
After weeks of trial, the grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 charges, including eight counts of murder by deception, a common high court offense, and one count of assault and battery.
The trial was "carefully planned and thought out", the jury said, describing Saipov's handling of the case as "terrible, brutal and extremely cruel".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured others, and caused grief to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the appeal regarding the ruling later said.
Five of the victims were immigrants from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York imposed the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse for his actions in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was feeling better about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was encouraged to do so after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to information about his case.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He denied all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's representatives, said he was "disappointed" by the federal prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the idea of accepting the death penalty rather than accepting a request to remain in prison with no chance of release would add to the grief of everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had already appealed to the jury to withhold the death penalty.
MP says Nigel FARAGE should take charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to 'call a mob like a war' today at a demonstration at the Council meeting.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be 'pressured' by EU Opponents - as one of Theresa May's advisers said was the proper way to manage negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a backbencher, told a crowd in Birmingham that the UK 'would have left' by now if Farage had been Secretary for Brexit negotiations.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in regaining the widely divided seats has been highlighted by the Opposition to Brexit taking part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The minister is trying to make his non-aligned plan work against the Brexiters, the EU candidates and the EU council.
His allies insisted that they would continue to try to negotiate with Brussels despite opposition - and force the EU Opposition and the Labour Party to choose between what they offer and 'chaos'.
Bone told a conference entitled Leave means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'call in the Brexit Deal Opponents'.
He also said that Farage should be involved and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge of the matter, we would have gotten out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we want to challenge the Brexit Deal Opponents.'
Speaking against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone denied the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'It is not true that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain.'
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Living in the EU is not what people want, the Opposition cannot accept this, it is not what our party and activists are fighting so hard for.
Please leave the EU and start listening to people.'
To Mrs May, he added: 'Officials like the prime minister keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Farage told the audience at the rally that politicians should be 'forced' if they are unfaithful in the 2016 election.
It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political party,' he said.
'They are trying to be dishonest about Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you do this'.'
In his message to the interest group he added: 'I want you to pressure our politicians, who have unreliable views on Brexit.
'We call on the global military community that fought for us over Brexit and we will not rest until we are an independent, free and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the EU membership campaign passed through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several protesters carried banners saying "Anti-Brexit" after the group launched this week.
The meeting was opened by Labour Party colleague Lord Adonis criticizing the Conservatives over the security concerns they had with their computer software.
'These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT system in the country and all the technology in Canada including, borderless disruption, free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It is a complete joke.
There is nothing better than Brexit,' he added.
Warren wants to "consider seriously" the presidential election
Representative Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider the issue of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democratic congressman spoke about his future at a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is expected to run for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He is considered a potential contender for Trump in 2020
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with a state representative using a question-and-answer format since Trump took office.
A bystander asked him if he would like to campaign for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for the mother to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that included the first lady".
Another arrested for shooting and killing LSU player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday the arrest of a suspected gunman who shot and killed LSU player Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
He released a video of the incident on Friday, asking for help identifying the person seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims sustained head injuries and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, 247 Sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot dead by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the area, carrying a weapon, and admitting that it was when he killed Wayde Sims with a gun.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started 10 games last season averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 goals and 2.9 assists per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton has a good chance of winning the world championship by beating Sebastian Vettel by the rules
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday in the qualifying round that the Mercedes team rules would have a bearing on the outcome of the final.
From the start, Bottas started the race well and Hamiliton was undefeated in both stages and called Vettel to face his teammate.
Vettel took the lead in qualifying, leaving Hamilton behind, failing to win.
Mercedes came in later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on after a wheel-steer that caused the Ferrari driver to come out inside free from the risk of being left behind to secure the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh in the final of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he grabbed his tires to finish fast and caught Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth time.
He later came into the starting lineup on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did a good job on the weekend and was a real hero to be honest.
The team has done a great job to have two winners", said Hamilton.
This Was Not a Good Way to Communicate
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
In a speech to a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the Senate's record shows that society is "cruel and wicked and false".
"One thing that can happen and the best thing that can happen in the last few days in the Senate is, when you see anger, you see people who are cruel and angry and mean and lying", he said.
"Look at the hidden message that comes out of the box, but hear the "iii, I didn't do that.
I did not".
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feistein, did you make it public?
You remember what he said... you said it out loud - "iii, iii, what?
No, not at all.
I didn't say it in public".
Well, let's put it this way.
Did we make it public?... No, we didn't", Trump added in the speech, which clearly refers to the senate.
Mr. Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the Kavanaugh case brought by Ford in July of the previous year, and the case was made public in September - but Mr. Feinstein denied that the revelation came from his office.
"I didn't hide anything about the Ford case, I didn't go public", Feinstein told the Senate Committee, according to The Hill.
"They told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret".
Such a refusal did not please the country's leader, who said at a rally on Saturday: "I assure you, this was not a good way to communicate by physical gestures.
Maybe not, but it was the most degrading gesture I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexual misconduct with three women, the President said the Democrats are using his claims to advance their own interests.
"Their goal is to regain power by any means necessary.
You can only imagine how cruel, brutal, and uncaring these people are about taking power", said the leader, according to the newspaper Mediaite.
For the Cup: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned the insult when they beat the Belfast Giants 5-3 in a replay at their home ground last Saturday.
The Belfast Giants led by two goals in the first half with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Dundee scored two goals in the second half, with Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie leading the way, and Dwyer of the Belfast Giants led the way.
Francois Bouchard scored the equaliser and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen added two more goals to bring the Dundee Stars victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League game of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between these teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute with 3:35 left by Kendall McFaull, another from Beauvillier through David Rutherford just four minutes from the first goal.
It was a busy opening period, with Sullivan returning the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score a goal that tied the score at 15:16.
Dwyer encouraged the Giants in the first half as he scored his second goal of the night's game late in the first period.
The home team Dundee had another idea and Bouchard scored a similarly strong goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played a brilliant pass to Nielsen who scored a goal for Dundee that gave the team a first-ever lead in the second half and added another extra point that brought the total to five in the game.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games in a row, are set to face Milton Keynes in a rematch on Friday.
Assistant Pilot Dies While Helping Hundreds of Passengers Escape Earthquake
An assistant pilot in Indonesia is being hailed posthumously as a hero for helping a plane carrying hundreds of passengers land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continued in the area and many were caught in the rubble in Palu.
While his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace on a tower that was shaking at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
Left to help Batik Air Flight 6321, which was operating at the airport at the time, to take off safely
Then he jumped on the very platform where he thought it was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, says that this decision has saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We arranged for a helicopter to fly him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a better hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very sorry to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster response agency says it is difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to be rising while some bodies are still under rubbish and many are not being contacted to check if they are still alive", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] have devastated Palu and there will be a memorial service for all the dead on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Things are being stolen from small markets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It is already a problem, but it can grow.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you all to work day and night to complete any evacuation operations.
Are you ready for this?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini announces one person is still missing after a plane crashed into water
The company, which owns the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean, also announced that one person was still missing, after initially believing that all passengers had been rescued when the plane crashed.
Air New Guinea announced that by Saturday afternoon, it had discovered that one male was missing.
The agency said it was working with local authorities, health officials and researchers to locate the missing man.
The company does not comment on details such as the age or nationality of the missing men.
The local boat owners performed a rescue operation after the plane crashed into the water as it was about to land at Chuuk Island.
Some authorities announced that a total of seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers had not yet been discharged from the hospital in Leukali, but all were recovering.
The exact cause of the accident has not yet been determined.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed just before it was due to land at the airport.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the road.
According to passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane flies at a very low altitude when it is told to.
"This is a wonderful thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to escape through waist-deep water to a shelter from a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were showing signs of dizziness and screaming loudly, and he said he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that boatmen working at a nearby repair yard helped to rescue people by taking them to shore in lifeboats before the plane sank to about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people died in air crashes registered in PNG over the past 20 years but none involving Air Niugini.
Experts give a chronological list of the steps leading up to the cremation
Prosecutors stayed the trial Saturday of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in a highly sensitive investigation.
He explained to the court how he used cellphones to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting earlier claims, Clarion Ledger said.
When it was shown that his phone was with Chambers at the time he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified that Saturday he was out of town that day.
When asked by the prosecution if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my car was in Nashville at the same time".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks after his death.
Evidence from cell phones suggests that they have known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's records, most of which were songs with his name on them, from his phone.
"They took him out of her life", Hale said.
The prosecutor is expected to give his final argument on Sunday.
The judge said that he hoped to have the case heard that day.
High Breed: What is hip hop marijuana?
Three hip hop musicians are considering changing the perception of marijuana's flaws by incorporating a message of encouragement into their music.
High Breed, a band from Bristol, says hip hop has moved beyond political songs to solving problems in our daily lives.
The idea of the gang is to restore the influence of the marijuana music to the original way of doing things.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York child care worker sues a couple for sending "racial" messages
A NY child care provider is suing a couple for sending racist messages after receiving a missing message from the mother complaining that she was "some black person".
The couple deny being racist, calling the case "a form of theft".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed frustration after learning that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"TWO BLACK PEOPLE", said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxmanto in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending the letter to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her guilt, the "unstable" Plasco-Flaxm fired Sister Maurice, claiming that her former childminder, an African-American, had done a bad job and was hoping to get someone from the Philippines instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was given a day's pay and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the loss of employment, and he wants $350 a day for six months, the equivalent of the concert he was working for before this contract.
"I want to show them, you see, you don't do things this way", he told the Post on Friday and added "I know it's racist".
The two defended themselves against the accusation of racism, saying that firing Maurice was the wise thing to do, fearing that they would lose confidence if they disappointed him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He is not partial.
We are not racist", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone who hurt them, even if it was not on purpose?
Your newborn?
You people".
Likening the case to a "stealing scheme", Plasco said that his wife was only two months pregnant and was going through "a very difficult time".
"Would you go out to fight a man in that situation?
It's not the best thing to do", the banker added.
While the case is still pending, a court of public inquiry has quickly criticized the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publishers of Paddington fear that readers will not be able to imagine the talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It is difficult to replace the person who first reads the book before it is published.
It is exciting to know now what we know about the great success of this Paddington book"
As for her father, before the former BBC cartoonist was inspired to write a children's book with a small teddy bear, it would be a shame to throw it away, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bitter and sweet" after he died last year.
Paddington's book, which he describes as "the most important of our family", adds that his father was very proud that he had finally succeeded.
"He was a calm man, and he was not a rude man", she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of them even though you're not the one who did it.
I think he saw Paddington's success in this way.
Despite his inventions and ideas, he always gives credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon arrival she was rushed with her daughter to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called repeatedly to say it was really bad, and that he didn't expect to recover", says Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad that he would die within the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs prescribed to stop his heartbeat were leaking out of his system.
He had been dead for a short time and this was just a cover-up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family members and others.
I had to take care of it myself".
Later Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with others - unaware of her problems.
"No one knows that", he said.
"My head was down, and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the trip that I felt for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved me.
Grieving mothers send cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two mothers whose children died by suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sending out cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Sister Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to hear how I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was blessed with a good cook who had a big smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
She always says that her smile lights up everywhere".
However, he resigned before his death, being "in great distress".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother dead.
"I worry about the results", says Davis.
Sister Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go to and talk to, even with a friend.
Don't just be silent - you have to talk".
Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her husband, Mark, a companion of 15 years, shortly after her mother.
"She didn't say she was upset or sad or anything", he said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw how he changed.
They were not very happy on Christmas Eve - the children opened their presents without looking at them or saying anything".
He added that his death was a terrible blow, but he had to endure it: "It left the family in a lot of pain.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep going and endure".

Brett Kavanaugh's fate unknown as FBI investigates
"I thought, if we could find something like what they are asking for - such as a short-term, small-scale survey - we could perhaps bring in a little bit more", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid a heated political battle.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is due to events that were about to occur.
Five weeks before the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be very weak in their attempt to get a candidate for the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush has been taking calls to the Senate, urging them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Bush and through whom Bush met his wife Ashley, his secretary.
What will happen when the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Kavanaugh can secure at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to settle the case and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of rebels "has decreased" under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean citizenship candidates has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing information from the office of the South Korean minister of foreign affairs, said there were 1,127 last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the improved border controls between North Korea and China and the high prices charged by smugglers are the reasons for the decline.
Pyongyang has not commented on the matter.
Many North Korean rebels are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee through China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers these rebels illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between North and South Korea - still in a state of war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss nuclear disarmament talks that had failed in the past.
This came after a special June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed in principle to work towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons in their respective Korean states.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the US sanctions had been a major disruption to the peace process since then.
"Without trust in America we will not be satisfied with our national security and in this respect we cannot begin to abandon nuclear weapons ourselves", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "crazy", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and said he lacked the intelligence to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview held Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman did this, she would be 'crazy,'" Pelosi said in her comments about Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he raped Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very upset, sometimes shouting and angry when talking about his family and high school years.
He also criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations "a vicious and defamatory attempt" by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he fired himself with what he would say and how he spoke for the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi expressed doubts when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh by a vote if confirmed, and whether the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"All I can say is - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the bench where he is", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that if a Democrat was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might challenge regarding the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was considered a Democrat attorney.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some decisions in the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a madman, a bigot to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not good,'" Pelosi said.
And wives should make good use of this provision.
With that just rebuke, months and years of wrath are flooding in, and they cannot bring it out without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry", Sister Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it is unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was raised somewhere, who said she too cried when she was angry, but she made a plan that when she was angry and started crying, she could say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I am angry with you".
And he just keeps going.
And I think it was a very good idea".
Tears are allowed as a way to vent anger because tears are not really understood.
One of the most memorable moments of my first job, in an office filled with men, where I once found myself crying in a rage, was being grabbed by an elderly woman - a gentle manager who I always felt a little intimidated by - who dragged me up the stairs.
"Don't let these people see you cry", he told me.
"He doesn't know he's angry.
They think you're sad and are happy to be with you".
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, after Hart was caught committing adultery on board the Monkey Business and was forced to withdraw from the race, Schroede, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he should not explore the idea of running for president.
"It was a bad decision", he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one person.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was a surprise campaign, he was behind in raising money, and he was determined not to participate unless he won $2 million.
This was a failure.
She found that some of her helpers who gave $1,000 to men should give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he wondered.
When the announcement of a no-campaign campaign was made, she was moved - thanks to those who supported her, disappointment at the system that made it difficult to raise funds and the anti-voting system, and anger at the discrimination - to tears.
"If you thought I was in a lot of trouble", Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media treated her.
"You would think that Kleenex was a sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking, What will they put on my tombstone?
"Did he cry"?""
A look at how China can benefit from the U.S.-China rivalry.
The start of the conflict was a scary and confusing one, but the experts who have been following it closely have found that the result will be a good one for China.
The beginning of this came when US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on major imports from China such as solar panels, various metals including aluminum.
The conflict seemed to reach a climax this week when the United States ordered a massive shipment worth 200 billion U.S. dollars, or 150 billion British pounds.
China has retaliated by imposing punitive tariffs on the United States, recently imposing tariffs of between 5 and 15 percent on goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to the attack in the manner the United States can and will.
To stop this trend, the US needs to stop making Chinese goods too expensive and attractive for the US but to openly subject China to the challenges that could bring shame on the country's leader, Xi Jinping.
However, some experts say that the trade deficit could be a long-term benefit to China in reducing the bilateral trade deficit, if China makes the right choices.
"Political decisions made in haste and for political reasons have the potential to disrupt economic activity in the Americas and China more than some people realize", says Abigail Grace, a Center for New American Security and an expert on Asian affairs.
Syria "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Ministry
Syria has said it is ready to return refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the world is beginning to improve.
"The situation is stable and secure so far thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said
The government continues to rebuild the areas devastated by terrorism to restore a healthy culture.
Everything is now settled for refugees to come to a country they had to flee from terrorism and economic policies that affected their daily lives and behavior.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country and need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept help in rebuilding the destroyed city.
But he insisted that it would not receive any aid with other needs or support from countries that supported the terrorists.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the USA by 16 points and a half to 10 and a half at Le Gold National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has won the Ryder Cup six years in a row and has not won the trophy since 1993.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, won the trophy again after scoring 14.5 goals to defeat the United States national team.
US team specialist Phil Mickelson, who failed to show his manhood in the tournament, threw a ball into the wrong hole which gave his opponent Francesco Molinari a field goal.
The Italian players performed spectacularly in all the matches, making him one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was not disappointed when he lost by 5&4 points to European team player Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who did not reach the professional level.
The world's most famous player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may be playing his final game in the Ryder Cup.
Ryder Cup champion, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has been Europe's leading scorer with 25.5 points during his playing career.
"I don't want to cry, but I can't help it.
This was a difficult year.
I am grateful to my teacher Thomas for his patience and trust in me.
I am so happy, so happy to have received the cup again.
The goal was for our team to win, and I am happy to have played a part in this victory", said Garcia, who seems very excited about the success of his European team.
He congratulated fellow citizen John Ram who defeated US Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm more proud of beating the champion Tiger Woods, the older I get watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and has now managed to win the Ryder Cup by a score of 13-21-3.
This is staggering considering that he is one of the world's greatest champions, having won 14 championships behind only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to get a good result except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-flight golf in all matches.
US general manager Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they've worked hard.
There was a time this morning when we bothered the European team.
We fought a war.
All credit goes to Thomas.
He is a good leader.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We'll do more, I can work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love all 12 of my friends and am proud to be their leader.
We can say good-bye.
We have to admit that our teammates played better than us".
Red Waves: Reduced in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a sharp decline in Red Tide numbers in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, red wave zones are found in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a decline in numbers.
The Red Wave volcano stretches for about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Sections are also found 10 miles upstream in Hillsborough County, but in smaller areas than last week.
Red Waves were also seen in Pasco County.
Mid-coastal concentrations in Pinellas County were reported last week, low and high concentrations in Hillsborough County, near and high concentrations in Manatee County, near and high concentrations in upper Sarasota County, low and high concentrations in Charlotte County, near and high concentrations in upper Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory problems continue to be reported in the towns of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No respiratory problems were reported in Northwest Florida last week.
