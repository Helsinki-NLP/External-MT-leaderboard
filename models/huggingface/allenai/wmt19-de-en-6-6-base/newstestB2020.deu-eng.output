Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large-scale fire in a chemistry plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, as reported by the Normandy prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainer were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso's directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety regulations.
About 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when gas methanthiol escaped through a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an industrial accident, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city ’ s wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to look for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job for it extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie was cut off from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was ill," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to reception. "The employee says," She left about four and a half hours ago, "" recalls Carole King opposite "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the Daily Inter Lake, who announced her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a phone call: A man reported and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered loudly, "Daily Inter Lake." The tears were flowing. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her. "
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six machine guns of the type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. Remaining remains unclear in most cases, and the opposition speaks of a "scary" extent.
Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is evident from a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence classified as a shutter, which the German editorial network reports on.
According to the paper from the office of State Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 shots of ammunition have so far reappeared. The still missing weapons and weapon parts are among other things six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six signal pistols as well as two guns of the type P8. In addition, there are missing 30 weapon pipes for machine guns of the type MG3.
The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is "frightening", said the Left Party MP Martina Renner. This applies all the more, as hardly anything has been found again in the course of investigations. The Left Party politician spoke of a "meager balance sheet". Renner criticized that the listing does not reveal whether the missing ammunition is also the one found in connection with the investigation against Franco A., the federal military officer suspected of terrorism. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for possession of these ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but at first it remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official communication from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was found on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Hormuz's Seestrasse on charges of violating security regulations. However, it was assumed that Iran reacted to the controversial temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar, which belongs to Great Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was dragged into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to people ’ s courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the GDR regime at that time, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded among other things of the occupation of the Stasi's headquarters. "The state security was taken away from the horror," she said.
Musk strives to record delivery
Teslas quarter may have a record. Despite the delivery boom, there have been losses at the electric car company.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record figures on the stock market. "We have the chance to achieve our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could place 110,000 orders, according to Musk ’ s circular letter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To this end Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, with six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter of the year. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
Puzzles solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebellum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists from the Humboldt Federal University in Berlin found out this with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question why children fight so violently against tickling, only in order to demand more.
After all, it has also been shown why only the approaching of a tickling hand causes laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebellum, which already triggers laughter in the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
Until now it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contact and contact with others - hence people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This was also so if living beings themselves clean up. However, during the foreign contact and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse had been intensified.
If, however, the self-touch and the touch by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat ’ s brain cannot distinguish between self-contact and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Therefore, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showing escape behaviour or horror rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the tickle is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and people.
Disaster averted: major fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The large-scale fire in a chemistry plant in the northern French city of Rouen is extinguished, as reported by the Normandy prefecture of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to authorities, no substances hazardous to health should have been withdrawn. The samples taken do not give any cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Local residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. Lubrizol belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which stipulates particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical factory already made headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanthiol was released through a leak and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an industrial accident, around 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city ’ s wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister ’ s sister commented on Boris Johnson ’ s speech at the first session in Parliament following the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country on 31 October without an agreement from the EU if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
About Cox, who had worked for Britain ’ s whereabouts in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox ’ s memory and reunite this country would be to withdraw the EU. ” Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum.
Memorial to attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims is revealed in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of approximately 1,000 iron roses. They remind of the roses, which had been laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone ∑ d is to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. At the opening among other Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette and Marit are expected.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing rorist Anders Behring Breivik first set fire to a car bomb in the Oslo government district and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a youth organisation holiday camp on the island of Utöya. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the conflict in Iran. But now there is less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which was held in Iran, could stand back at sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now going to Dubai for medical examinations, said shipping director Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the fixing of the vessel illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards set the tanker on charges of violating the laws of sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. Hånell said that the remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances. They would have behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and frightening situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working on bringing them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that the "Stena Impero" was a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar, where a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, had been put on the chain at the beginning of July. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya" 1 was finally released. London vehemently rejected the assumptions that it was a barter business to get rid of the "Stena Impero".
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important maritime routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world ’ s oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping was dragged into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents occurred with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects that. The USA had left the international nuclear agreement alone in 2018, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time stop its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and enlarged agreement on other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wants to ensure the safety of navigation in the Persian Gulf with the initiative "Coalition of Hope".
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India would actually be predestined to become a "war winner." Given the punitive tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redeploy. Asian financial leaders who are considering moving their production from China to another country, call India one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. That, of course, does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. India seems to have created a giant pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers to play a more significant role in the globally branched production chain.
But now India itself has become Trump ’ s focus. Decried as the “kingdom of tariffs ” by the white-house houseowner, America withdrew the emerging-market trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US denounces India prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, however, the friction with India is only a side stage. America also looks at the world ’ s largest democracy through its security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine concern about China ’ s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India ’ s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken a second five-year term of office, should therefore weigh in safety.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult status in the socialist republic of India. Under Modi, too. His reformist primarily aims at the bureaucratic madness, which suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive quicker building permits for buildings. They profit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more insolvency and bankruptcy law creates prerequisites for liquidating apparently companies with high debts faster.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in India in the first five modes of the year. However, this does not apply in trade policy. Concerning protecting internationally less competitive companies from foreign providers, the national-conservative government even established new barriers.
In the West, modes are attached to the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to discharge anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businesses who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries belong to the original voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Burial of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is reported to be buried in Paris next week. Former head of state will be buried in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, reported the news agency AFP citing the Chirac family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. A public funeral service was scheduled for Sunday in the Paris Invalides Cathedral, as media reported.
The competitor to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swap dangerously in the first run of the men over 5000 meters. He could hardly stand on his legs 300 meters before the finish, ran in an unhealthy posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea and Bissau suddenly stopped him and dragged him to the finish, supporting the last half of the stadium round. However, the forces were still sufficient for both to stop the watch after the finish run. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he drew the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly. Shy he first avoided, did not want to talk at all about his heroic deed. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would become difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances he could not have even started. "Therefore, I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this on the evening with vigour - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroism will remain in memory. Especially since Dabo even let his rival Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end it had nothing to use, because the Busby came only with much help to the finish was disqualified exactly for this reason at the end of the World Lightweight Federation.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to make a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, he succeeded with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes". However, only in training, because best times do not count.
Millions mash: Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. On Friday, a reinforced police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo. Several underground stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched pedestrian mobile phones for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They directed themselves against the government of President Abdel Fattah al and Sisi, accusing the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had not been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. Egyptian building contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in exile in Spain, who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "multi-million march" in central places in the country this Friday. Ali calls for a "popular revolution". The man is for most young Egyptians no "good either, because he acted as a subcontractor for the army millions, but his messages arrive.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) held more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and commented on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "arbitrarily arrested", "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'", HRW informed arrested people, citing lawyers. According to their lawyers, the accusations against those arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, also arbitrarily questioned and searched passers-by in accordance with HRW.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the Cairo government is blocking websites and online gambling services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Approximately 20 million returns land on the trash. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando how to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempted from VAT on non-cash donations, the ministry said on a question from the Green Bundestag parliamentary group, about which the newspapers of the Funke Media group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the German citizens would return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the garbage. Donating them would cost the companies additional money according to current legal conditions, because the financial authorities rate donations in kind as a turnover, on which then VAT is incurred.
Green Party leader Katrin Göring Eckardt called on finance minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products for sale accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online retail, but also to other shops from fashion shops to the construction market.
Banksy - Art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart and Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy ’ s work underlines “the regeneration of the world ’ s oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes. ” From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby ’ s in the British capital until it is to be auctioned off on October 3. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the south-west of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again, at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
At the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, following the suspension by the Supreme Court of a forced break imposed by Johnson, gave himself a hard swap with the opposition. Johnson wants to make the Brexit, which had already been postponed twice on 31 October, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in Brexit ’ s debate. In Dover ’ s southeastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the work every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit premier debate is like a “walk in the park ”
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’ s violent verbal attacks on Brexit ’ s opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a “walk in the park, ” said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation.“ We enjoy that. We will quit (from the EU) and we will win. ”
Johnson had attacked Brexit ’ s opponents in parliament over the past few days and accused them of “treason ” among other things. He dismissed accusations that he could put MEPs at risk because they could become targets of death threats as“ humbug. ”
Cummings said that the only way to restore calm was to finally respect the British ’ s decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the Bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should talk to each other with respect," said a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan ’ s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the Uno Plenary Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, said Khan at the Uno ’ s general debate in New York on Friday. “If that is going badly, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst. ” The United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir.“ You should have prevented that. ”
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn the Indian Kashmir region from the autonomy status and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President Al Sisi.
The government reacts with a hard hand against the current protests in Egypt. It lets fire the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 arrested prisoners join in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protecting has never been harmless in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took over power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything possible to avoid a scenario such as during the Arab Spring.
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by the own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of El Sisi does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the rate of inflation is ten percent. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket have to decide who they finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before the Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be, if large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv's Exams in the Terminal: BER's Chief: No more "Showstopper" for Capital Airport
Two months were checked whether the complex system mesh works in cooperation with the BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October of next year. This was certain, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still deficiencies in the terminal to be dealt with. "We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real show stopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
There are, however, indications that the temporary reserve is not likely to be too large any more. The construction job notification is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of shortcomings in power cables have yet to be remedied; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of the flight operation, intensive work must continue to be done on the processing of the defects", said a written notice.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no approval for all plugs on which the cable lanes hang. The airport chief expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection does not yet work satisfactorily at the transition to the station under the terminal. The problems had already led the project three years ago into another crisis. This time it is about smoke aprons, which shut down in a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and further construction defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was to go into operation in 2011. Since construction began in 2006, the costs have increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year.
As the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October should be held, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new Managing Directors. Finance manager Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Human Resources Director Manfred Bobke and Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs blown up - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several vending machines into the air in the city area of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
In the past two years, the number of blown up cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region had risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German at Bu � rgerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations into explosives explosions in a crime unit with a particularly serious case of theft carried out by the Chemnitzer criminal police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33" Yes ".
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33 year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight deeds.
"With the loot he has obviously financed his drug dependence". Four times the bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on the Bu � rgerstraße between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The resulting total damage amounts to at least 60 000 Euro!
The automatic bomber is now in custody. Police investigations against him continue.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automats and explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa ’ s subsidiary AUA takes over “the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna ”, confirmed on Friday a press officer of Austrian Airlines to APA." AviationNetOnline "had previously reported on this.
The Vienna base of Lufthansa ’ s low-cost Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. AUA will take over these from January 2020 in the “Wetlease ”, i.e. including Eurowings ’ personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings ’ jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Trains from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the speaker said. The flight times will be coordinated on connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the hub Vienna and on the other hand to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings only serves in Vienna as a "Production Company" for the group sister AUA. Barcelona and Rome, for example, would be served with an AUA flight number, but mainly with a Eurowings device. Although the on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair ’ s subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna will be increased to 16 aircraft next summer. Irish low-cost aircraft will send four Ryanair aircraft including crews to Vienna, also in the so-called “Wetlease ”, which the union criticised as a bypass to the collective agreement.
Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair, said that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years' time, and Andreas Otto, CEO of AUA, said on Friday: "We remain the number one at the site in five, six or ten years' time."
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped at the beginning of the month in Italy for the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can hardly wait to be married," the couple who have been together since October 2018 according to British media reports reported in the official release.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie kneeling the pictures
The official engagement photos have been taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information on date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
It is certain, however, that the marriage of number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a similar celebration as the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for the cardiovascular system. But what really triggers a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the genetic material of 9000 people Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, announced the University Hospital Hamburg (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne District Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. The high-mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich, are involved in Switzerland.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Centre at UKE.
More than 4000 of the 20,000 or so relevant human genes are currently known to cause possible changes in the DNA - so-called mutations -, according to the hospital. Each year about 200 additional genes are added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. Data could also be used for research into other common diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Heart and Vascular Centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne sondern Foundation, Klaus Moreover Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data also for the investigation of other diseases. Up to now, the clinic of the foundation in Davos deals mainly with allergies. Now a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created at the medical incampus there and a professorship for bioinformatics be created. To justify his engagement, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bioprobes of the healthy participants originate from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the hospital. In the case of genome decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymised data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the genetic material of a human being can now be decoded within 24 hours, with a mere cost of 1300 Euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million Euros. The study is expected to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are expected to be analysed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police liberate hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still underage, according to Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were abused. Some of them said they had been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. Indeed, the protégés had been detained by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children at the age of nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran School has existed for about ten years. Local residents would have drawn the authorities' attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. Parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They would not have suspected of the suffering of their children. According to police, the operator and six employees were arrested.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 40,000 people fled over the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and Tortured: Nigeria's Police Release 400 Children from School
In a school in northern Nigeria, police freed nearly 400 students from appalling conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after a reference in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "inhumane", the officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school like slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed ill-tempered and injured pupils in a noticeably poor state of health.
World football: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps freestyle
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Trudeau, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe honored
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Federation awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth honour and record.
After Nicaragua ’ s captain declared that he had never voted for the World Player ’ s election, accusations were made against FIFA from other countries. Egypt was not counted at all – with a curious explanation.
Many things have turned out to be offensive in recent years: the FIFA World Cup awards, dubious plans by its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Football Cup election has not been suspected of running out of control until now - if one foresaw that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than for objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua ’ s captain complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies now emerge: Egypt laments that the votes were not taken into account by national coach Hossam El and captain Mohamed Salah. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The FIFA apologizes in so far that "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid." The Egyptian federation was contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan coach also amazed
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to ∑, however, the vote had just as been made, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese federation.
Nicaragua ’ s captain Juan Barrera also raised accusations: “I did not vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you, ” he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The announcement came from the association on Friday: True, but was of course no intention. The completed election documents were "mistakenly" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said in a message of the association. But actually the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We assume the responsibility for the administrative error", said in the communication. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "quite as it stands in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases are now being investigated by FIFA, but emphasises that the election process has been supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Footballers' election - and Jürgen Trudeau World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine ’ s affair: Ranghohe Republicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly declared themselves in favour of an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. “I think the investigation is important, ” said the Republican governor of the US federal state of Vermont, Phil Scott.“ Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are found. ” He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action. An impeachment may lead to the president ’ s dismissal.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe ∑ in Ukraine. Scott said that he was "observing for years."
The Republicans have hitherto withheld criticism of Trump ’ s whistleblower affair, and few have shown unease about it. Scott ’ s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party, with Virginia ’ s moderate governor having repeatedly turned against Trump ’ s policies, such as easing environmental legislation and tightening up immigration rules.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke out for the investigation. “It ’ s a deeply disturbing situation, ” Baker said.“ The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it. ”
Scott and Baker, as governors of US federal states, do not formally have a say in the trial against Trump, about which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, also first senators of the Republicans have critically expressed themselves about the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair may lead to the opening of an impeachment case against Trump, while the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. Democrats could use their majority in the House of Representatives to make a so-called impeachment. However, the decision to actually impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority. Thus, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment to the office.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unlawfully sailed the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was cancelled after a few days by an Italian judge.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea's Watch 3". The suspects were taken to a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have secure information on it," said Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police reported in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "Migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," the communication said.
NGO and relief organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who the ships are coming to. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people flee from Libya. Therefore, it is quite probable that the perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed".
Italy ’ s right former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately called for an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for delivery record at Tesla
Tesla ’ s CEO Elon Musk has given a strong boost to his electric car company with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an E-Mail published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla's employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could place 110,000 orders, according to Musk ’ s circular letter. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. To this end Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Teslas shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not increased so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, with six-digit figures in the current and upcoming quarter of the year. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses.
US Budget dispute: Only one bridge financing again
The new financial year will begin in the US on 1 October, without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase expenditure ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again ahead of the new fiscal year, which begins on 1 October, without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have taken place on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump must still put the decision into force.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is now financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot profit for the time being from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion dollars.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the expenditure laws reflect democrats ’ priorities, which have little chance in the Republican Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely capable of majority voting.
In the Senate, Republicans seem to be trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump ’ s major priorities. Democrats are bothering with the wall plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the building of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The ghosts of the Wall Separate
At present it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the ongoing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve expenditure laws in time, and the associated danger of shutdown, ideas are gaining popularity to automate the process. Presentation, p. 1877, to avoid shutdowns, would automatically continue funding the federal administration at the level of the previous year, prevent parliamentarians from travelling and keep their wages back until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill from the government, according to which all women can benefit from insemination in Vitro. Thus, the demand for anonymous sperm donations is likely to increase significantly.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future numerous "children without a father" could grow up. Also, the French Bishops' Conference is against innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that defended health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm forbidden by dead husband
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women complained in vain of the release of a deceased man's sperm. Opponents of the offense in Paris argued that such a child was bearing a "particularly serious fate".
Many members of the governing party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out against it for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning", if her wish for children would remain unfulfilled due to the death of her husband.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that a widow may in future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination in France is only permitted for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: calls for flight tax for unis become louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities. Therefore, the country wants a climate levy to be paid there in the future. Rectors say that they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also confine themselves to flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion on a climate levy on flights by universities and universities, postponed before the summer break, is reviving. After the state rectors' conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a pedagogical university plead for compensation of service flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate about the avoidability of flights, it says in their opinion. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision originally planned in July is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again captures North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the detainees were allegedly illegally fishing in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time, there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, it was said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were thus travelling in Russian territorial waters, where Russia ’ s coastguard, according to its own information, patrol their marine biological resources.
30,000 cuttlefish seized
30,000 octopuses were discovered and confiscated on the boats during the new inspections. Furthermore, according to the data, three fishing and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia ’ s fishing authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans even after complaints by local entrepreneurs this year. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, the media have been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries and Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be decomposed.
In the future only 18,000: USA lower asylum ceiling
The “most generous nation in history ”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected White House police officials.
The richest country in the world is isolating itself from those seeking protection: as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal migration of refugees is further lowered. In future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees again. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the US Department of State explained. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has drastically lowered the readiness to welcome those seeking protection from around the world in recent years, with far higher entry limits under Barack Obama ’ s previous government.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was launched in 1980. Nevertheless, the US Department of State described the US as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly reminds of the language used by the US President in office.
A “responsible approach ” to refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild them, Trump said. He gets a lot of support from supporters for his tough migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to seal off. Trump imposed a national state of emergency to finance the construction of a border wall. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and possibly imminent impeachment.
According to the Foreign Office, the US Government intends to focus in the future on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States wants to achieve that in particular people from this "northern triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration to the US's southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of Utan from Zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a reception station for apes in the USA at the request of the Argentine judiciary. "Sandra", born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was awarded the rights of a "non-human person", therefore her release was imperative. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilogram human apse is not able to adapt to the life in the wilderness, it is to live in the future in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more oranges Utans and 31 chimpanzees accommodated, among them "Bubbles", former pet of popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" has to pass through a approximately 40 hour quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr -Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated in 2014 by animal conservationists, contributed to the transformation of the zoo in Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education centre for the conservation of biodiversity is to be established there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded at the nearly 3000 meter high Great Tine in the Italian Alps a new Husarenritt.
Without net, double floor or other means, the Swiss conquered the 550 metre high north face of the Great Tine in a new record time.
Clothed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus he forbade the old best-brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose in the past quarter to 1.4 billion dollars (almost 1.3 billion euros), 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses his customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike ’ s sales rose most strongly in China with a 22 percent increase. The Beaverton Group in the US state of Oregon thus benefited from its approach to addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thereby increasing its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. Jesus, a defender from Brazil, had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and called on his club to take action. "@ officialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud of being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted on late Thursday. He had reported the fan ’ s account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporter should never again visit a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scanning racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums", FIFA president Gianni Infantino had said on the weekend. On the occasion of the statement were racist chants in the first-league match between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence last Sunday.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are no longer allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. Thus, for the rest, prohibitions of four to seven years apply.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra and Fang groups in the vicinity of Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are accused of heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are said to be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have blackmailed Juventus ’ s employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - whole vintages are considered with conceptual terms. Look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"Crabs are coming!" This call officially launched the crab catch on Lake Gucheng in Gaochun on September 21, with the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started crab breeding at the beginning of the 1990s. Over the years, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that generated high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun ’ s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively engaged in a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding and technology-based crab breeding, and the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers ’ income.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform on the "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and government services" and has carefully set up the service network for "permits under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending". Thus, the city intends to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages by connecting it to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and takes advantage of the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a showcase for intelligent high-end production plants, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health industries as well as enterprises for ecological agriculture, which are leaders in the "3 + 2" area, to settle here. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone covering all areas and of tourist resorts of national importance. Here, the ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun were integrated, the state of the buildings for civil services and for the public service comprehensively improved, the areas "tourism +" and "+ tourism" developed vigorously and the development of cultural tourism on a high quality level. It is worthwhile to look forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran – US Conflict: Ruhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return to the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the US to lift sanctions, and the United States, in return for talks with Tehran ’ s leaders, had promised an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, President Donald Trump contradicted his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and urged a meeting to take place. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added. The nature of the penalties that should be ended has been debated. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this advance did not take place in an acceptable way, criticised Ruhani. Given the current penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the margins of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani will meet with US premier Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes hit Western Turkey in the shortest time, the fear of a catastrophe grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases the concern for a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shocked the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now, the government wants to use a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul ’ s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential buildings collapse - made up among other things by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which were entered in the centre as sanctuaries, have long since been added. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber warned that estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's earthquake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and about seven kilometres deep, as reported by the Civil Protection Agency Afad. A minor aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. State broadcaster TRT showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in Silivri District for security reasons. Some students cried, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is regarded as particularly earthquake-endangered. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the anatolian earth slab. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. However, it is unclear when it comes to the earthquake. In the earthquake on Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go bags packed with everything needed to stand next door, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wobbles. When the next big quakes come is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of Istanbul ’ s catastrophes and coordination center (Akom), according to which two minarets of mosques collapsed in Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were shaking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday ’ s, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershock. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the earthquake is officially stated at 1.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a aftershock, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shocked the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Even its epicentre was located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority informed Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy calculates that the earthquake is now a pre-warning. It has become more likely by this, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "Sooner or later, the big earthquake will also come".
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great concern also in Istanbul. In Albania, besides, there had been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance this year the earth had ravaged.
Parliament: New ignition material in Ukraine
Two explosive documents are creating a new fuel in Ukraine for the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment process, the US Democrats are encouraged: the complaint about Trump, filed by an anonymous whistleblower, and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president, provide important indications for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once more as the victim of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passengers locked in toilets - flight diverted
Because a passenger was locked up in the board toilet, a flight was diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, according to the US media.
At an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour had she been locked in it, US media wrote citing other passengers. For the onward flight towards San Francisco, passengers had to change the plane.
In a video broadcast on the Internet, which according to the US media is supposed to come from flight 1554, it can be seen how several people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, Okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. Open at first was whether the woman receives compensation.
The Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit's novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with Brexit as a whole? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Metamorphosis", British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit's chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, told Diogenes Verlag (Zurich). It deals with the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is wildly determined to be stopped by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers shamelessly lie like once the Soviet leaders, if Brexit in high positions almost implored the catastrophe of a no-dealer - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." From McEwan had appeared only in the spring of the novel "Machines like me" about Artificial Intelligence.
Kafka ’ s story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society, and finally perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down in front of Kafka to describe a world that stands in its head," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria ’ s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary get whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. Furthermore, sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this is intended to make journeys more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. Funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all journeys until 31 October 2019, one day after his application for insolvency. Travel could not be taken "for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or have been paid in full. As regards travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In consultation with the insolvency insurance the further procedure was examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen victim to the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed an application for insolvency on Wednesday. Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, among others, employs around 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels immediately
On the other hand, as of this Friday, hotels abroad that are still accommodating Thomas Cook ’ s holiday makers will receive money from the Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, the payments made to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas Cook and travellers from these hotels are not immediately asked for individual payment of hotel invoices or otherwise," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance thus responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own data, had been forced to pay their lodgings on site themselves. Some had therefore to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticised this.
How many hotels are affected, will be coordinated on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance spokesman. According to data from Thursday still 70 000 Thomas and Cook were on the way package holidaymakers from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return travel of the Thomas and Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The now announced disbursements to hotels by the Zurich insurance, however, only help the travelers, who are currently still on the way. For Thomas and Cook customers, who still want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening the company informed that all journeys until including 31 October would be cancelled. This applies also for such bookings, which are already paid.
As regards travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance the further procedure was examined, said. Basically, for these cases also the insurance Zurich is responsible. The sale of new journeys has stopped.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price on the Kaera website and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
For a long time Prince Harry has continued the engagement of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly in the footsteps of his mother.
Clothed with a blue shield vest, the British Prince Harry set fire and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in Dirico, he produced the Zündkreis on Friday morning in front of on-going TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosive explosive exploded in the savannah landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961 – 1997). He wanted to travel the way she went with the same warden who once accompanied his mother. Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997, and she too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Since Monday, Harry (35) and his wife (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa, which started in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stockende Brexit – Negotiations: The danger of a no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had unequivocally agreed: with him there will certainly not be a third postponement of Brexit. But what statements are of eternal duration with the polarizing British. The recent verdict of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hovers like a sword of Damocles over the Blondschopf. His suspension of the parliament, in order to be able to conduct his Brexit course until the exit date stubbornly, was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to effect an extension of the bilateral talks in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson considers Deal still possible
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably over Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made suggestions that he would support an extension of the negotiations in case of non-agreement by the end of October:
You know, we will abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I ’ m cautiously optimistic that it works.
And the time is running away from Brexit ’ s negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have six weeks left to prevent Britain from withdrawing from the European Union without an agreement. However, even the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough again. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the date of withdrawal is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister ’ s words. It fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no deal.
U.S. Authority: More deaths from cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has increased to twelve. Moreover, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the US Health Authority (CDC) informed. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected persons, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known so far.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of people have shared the videos of Mohammed Ali in online networks. Spain ’ s builder and actor is calling for a “popular revolution. ” For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass demonstrations with one million participants in central places in the country.
At any rate, the security authorities are alarmed. A reinforced police presence has already been observed in the centre of Cairo. Several underground stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in the past few days, the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos in connection with the protests.
On 20 September, demonstrators gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted hard to it. According to the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) almost 2000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW informed arrested persons citing lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocked websites and online services to prevent further protests against al and Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved fox of Greenland's expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland Expedition on Friday. Upon his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed, among other things, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
In the past months Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the shores of Iceland and Greenland with a team of scientists.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. Among other things, the expedition had been measured with a drone of Greenland glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics, said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the oceans", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "Arved Fuchs is a great model for all of us who are concerned about the survival of the oceans," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
€430 for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euro tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate the question of whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified themselves the local owner. However, this cannot be taken from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 per cent of the bill is normal, the landlord said.
A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an impeachment procedure, the Democrats now want to examine it as soon as possible with their enquiry into the House of Representatives - the talk is about weeks before a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal is allegedly the telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public for concern about national security and for the democracy of the USA with his complaint, is monstrous: The president had abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He had exploited the dependence of Ukraine thereby blackmailing and thus forcing them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be traced in the meanwhile published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. However, the call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, at the center of which is, besides Trump, his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public ’ s point of view, history begins in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani ’ s travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected president Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. “We don ’ t interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation of what we have the right to, ” he says. One might think it is inappropriate, but“ there is nothing illegal ”. Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis – “because this information will be very, very helpful for my client and could turn out to be helpful for my government. ”
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump ’ s counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conjured up with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russia ’ s offensive investigation in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
It is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently to Selenskyj on the phone in July. Giuliani ’ s version and the President ’ s version is that the former vice-president and currently prospective candidate for the Democratic presidential candidature, Joe ∑, as Ukraine, urged Obama ’ s government commissioner to dismiss the then Ukrainian prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, to stop the gas company ’ s investigation that he was responsible for, on whose supervisory board his son Hunter ∑ was active. ∑ senior has financially blackmailed Ukraine to cover up his family ’ s corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Blatter demanded that the Ukrainian Prosecutor General should go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, and Hunter ∑ was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt conduct, and the US Government was far from the only Western partner to push for his release. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp app: Social media are down
Users around the world report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, mainly Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook does not load again and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also the fault seems to be affected by the malfunction, although not so far to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by malfunctions
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And, as in previous cases, users also this time mainly resort to Twitter to make their annoyance air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on the way with a rubber dinghy and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for recovery.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9: 30 o'clock we received the news, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the inflatable boat".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - above all the new iPhone 11th models, we would like to remind you of another study from the beginning of July. Although wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, it is not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If a mobile phone is normally charged by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly located next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. Furthermore, the watt strength of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces its capacity, but also keeps it through for not so long. Therefore, the researchers advise that the smartphone should always be charged by cable. As a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of battery exchange - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are meanwhile already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels as well as cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and laborious plug fummelei. Since with Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) a world-wide standard prevails, in which exceptionally even Apple participates, there are hardly restrictions. Nevertheless, the technology should be applied according to the researchers only in exceptional cases.
Everest and Stau Photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer announced.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He already made international headlines: from him comes a photo of mountain climbers who are standing on the Mount Everest snake viral in the spring.
The picture of the mass attack triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and highest summit of the earth. In May, within a few days eleven climbers had died during the climb.
One problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousand: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One reason for this is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal ’ s government wants to talk to China in order to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals there was also a pregnant elephant cow, reported on Friday. "We suspect that the elephant were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and by many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the animals were presumably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously held harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live. In theory, the death penalty stands for their killing.
Maintained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This was announced by the Maritime Office of Bandar Abbas according to the IRNA news agency. Iranian Revolutionary Guards had accused the British flag tankers of violating the laws of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf on July 19.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critique
The responsible economic committee of the lower house wants to investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. It is to deal with the salary packages of the executive board as well as the question why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the enterprises fighting for survival. "Our interest is the supervision in the company as well as the control by external accountants", the committee chairman Rachel Reeves informed in London. "Apparently we have to deal with a bad example of management greed".
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of the genes in the increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family nutrition habits, are more likely to weigh than previously assumed. DKFZ scientists stress that this has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk.
Elon Musk Increases Tesla Shares
This is what Musk wrote in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand was strong, so that Tesla could place 110 '000 orders, it was further in Musk's circular.
The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customers. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla ’ s shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly for almost four months. Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360 '000 to 400' 000 cars. Six digits have to be produced for this in the current and next quarter of the year. Above all the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom there were losses last.
Will British government bypass Brexit ’ s law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law recently passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. To answer a question, he just said to journalists on Friday that his government will abide by applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that would make negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the post-EU exit period.
Johnson said he strives for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran apparently drives uranium enrichment high
Iran ’ s President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on European contractors in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. “Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions, ” Rohani said at a press conference on Thursday on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not stand by their promises, he offered“ further steps ” away from the agreements of the arduously negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the promise to normalize economic relations with Tehran. In 2018, the US left the agreement alone to force Iran to change course in the aggressive Middle East policy with "maximum pressure". President Donald Trump ’ s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now relying on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently reacted with a repeat of the uranium enrichment limited in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or at least prepared the centrifuges installed with uranium at the beginning of September. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not prepared to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of US sanctions, presumed Rohani. Nevertheless, there would be further talks, which hopefully would bring a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran ’ s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US ’ s assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had known about the attack, but this was seen by the US as a false confession. “We have nothing to do with it, ” Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rohani. However, European leaders would not have been able to do so during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have relied only on the rebels in Yemen not carrying out an attack like this. Rohani had met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Prior to possible talks with President Trump, Rohani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions of the US administration be lifted. He called on the government in Washington to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason. ”
Comet crossed by other star solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This was achieved before. The comet allows conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after its explorer on 2I / Borisov and aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The wide-travelled comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo-Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres in diameter. Afterobservations of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
2I / Borisov is after 1I / 'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object, which was sighted during a transit of our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get a close look at a foreign solar system before it disappears on eternity. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which lies at this distance clearly above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbola track that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which had initially been led under the catalogue number C / 2019 Q4, received the designation 2I / Borisov from it, whereby the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov was already seen in the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible until April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes", explained Farnocchia. "After that it will only be observed by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes".
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. Thus, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object in a first investigation on 2 to 16 kilometers. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our colleague Javier Licandro, de León.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission from the European space agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (comets of interceptors) on a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth. According to the scientific director Günther Hasinger, it is to lurk either on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor like 1I / 'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing ’ s new MegaAirport Daxing
Just in time for the People ’ s Republic ’ s 70th birthday, a first passenger aircraft from China United Airlines has landed at the new MegaAirport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
Around 45 million passengers are expected to be handled annually at the new airport by 2022, and 72 million by 2025. China ’ s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China ’ s latest prestigious project is also called “starfish ” because of its six-arm structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
The Chinese had already announced several times during the construction that Berlin could learn from Beijing. So far, the opening of the - and much smaller - capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, after four years, a first passenger aircraft landed.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - this is what the UK Space Agency dreams of. The US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency to make possible this flight, which was planned for the 2030s, at the supersonic speed a special drive (Synergetic Air and Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire develops. "This is the technology that this could definitely accomplish," said agency chief Graham Turnock to the transmitter. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced".
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. Until now, the Concorde was the only supersonic aircraft for passenger transport that had covered the New York route from 1976 to the termination of its operation in 2003 and needed three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers died. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane", together with the US Space Agency. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed dot to dot to dot to transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus made the "next generation of truly reusable frame vehicles" possible.
Washington uproar: Trump wants to track down anonymous typos in Ukraine ’ s affair
In Ukraine, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House for US President ’ s possible abuse of power.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump said on Thursday in front of the staff of the US embassy to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with such in the past "a little different" was handled than today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate Tippgeber. Actually, the event was not public. However, several US media distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats responded outraged to the President ’ s statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for an impeachment case against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations were mainly based on the written complaint made by an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On Thursday, the whistleblower ’ s account had been made public under great public pressure.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials, according to which the US president "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the US election of 2020.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe ∑, who is concerned with former business of Biden ’ s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. ∑ is in the lead in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with a view to Ukraine ’ s telephone call: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic wording of the protocol had been prepared. However, this had been removed from a usually intended database after the conversation by lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. "The New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the CIA foreign secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called whistleblower had spread second-hand information that would have turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps there were no typos or spies at all.
But, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have information for the whistleblower, indignation aroused. US House Chair Nancy Pelosi reacted alarmed and complained that Trump ’ s statement once again undermines the government ’ s integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been underway in various committees for months against Trump and his surroundings. In view of Ukraine ’ s accusations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new vigour to launch a possible impeachment case against Trump.
“The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation, ” said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked ship, accused him of misrepresenting things, and once again called for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly scolded ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials in the security and foreign policy field, who were mostly under democratic but also under Republican presidents, stood in a statement published on Friday behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible impeachment procedure. If the accusations were to be true, that would be "an unscrupulous abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further procedure. By their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats might try to impose a so-called impeachment. However, the decision to actually impeachment would fall into the Senate, where Trump ’ s Republicans have the majority. Thus, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment to the Office.
VW's Works Council: jobs are "creeping down"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the car maker around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. 500 million euros of this already this year are to be saved.
The "Future Pact", which was negotiated between companies and works council in 2016, already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be dismantled by the car maker if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment protection is valid until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from company council circles, however, jobs in the production, which actually are not in disposition, are "creeping" over another way dismantled - thus the official course over. Thus become free regular places often would not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council had no possibility to force the reoccupation. In the meantime, staff were lacking in many places, the concentration of work increased, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would increase. Thus, the fear that the vehicle could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide even more and control new projects centrally. This, too, is to reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production director Andreas Tostmann said at a manager's conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the imminent trade war between the USA and China we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof".
For example, production costs per vehicle have been reduced for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, has been reduced by 1.1 hours for the first time this year. VW does not specify exact figures for the production time, according to information from our newspaper, the production time for the Golf 7 is around
20 hours.
In our region, the parent plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies internally to VW, that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems with the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust gas test procedure WLTP.
However, as production director Tostmann announced last year, one million cars are supposed to roll off the belt in Wolfsburg. This is intended to make the bundling of the production of golf in the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant transfers the production of golf through the conversion to the location for the e-car production.
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUV are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to build the e-mobility, it is to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburger for the time being.
Forced to prostitution with Voodoo: Condemned traffickers
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six alleged traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused had thrown young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave the country had to take a ritual oath in front of a voodoo.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to process the alleged smugglers' costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, they were completely deprived of their wages.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the injection and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the process. "The work made the women physically and psychologically difficult to create," said judge Isabel Hoffmann in the verdict proclamation. "Some were correctly disgusted".
The judgments are on commercial and band-based entry of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Dauerstreit with the Lufthansa Group once again threatened the flight attendants union Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on October 14 about the labour struggle measures in the LH Group", Ufo's collective bargaining director Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have refused to negotiate with Ufo for months. It is also a question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined to appeal against it. "I consider that a second court sees the case completely differently," said Ufo's board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the State Labour Court in Frankfurt to check the status of Ufo as a union in court. The company argues that the union has not been setting up a representative board for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
It was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the Category Union, during which numerous members of the Board of Directors as well as the Advisory Board resigned, including Nicoley Baublies, long-time union chief. Ufo had suspended an agreement on strikes by cabin personnel at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not exactly been known as an international tourist – Magnet – but this is now to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visas.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the tourism commission announced the intention to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visa is usually given only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules the erzkonservativeKönigreich hopes more income from the tourism business. According to Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of Saudi Arabia ’ s most important oil plants in the east: the country ’ s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production dropped dramatically, and oil price shoots rose. It is likely that it will take several weeks for the Kingdom ’ s oil production to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for the wedding festival
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. On Thursday (local time), the model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. According to the magazine, Reality and Star Kendall Trudeau (23) and others had organized a youth party in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my smoking for the wedding". According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the Yes word a year ago in a New York registry office. There had not been a bigger party at that time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently said that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in a plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the western Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. The dead were a 38 year old woman and a 64 year old man.
The authorities had searched for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent an emergency signal by GPS. A military helicopter was also in use in the search. The accident cause still has to be determined. The crash place is approximately 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are causes of the threat, the World Union for the Protection of Nature IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It investigated the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "endangered", "strongly endangered", "threatened by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide than endangered.
Rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany above all Ebereschen (Sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German press agency. "Most are threatened, because the populations are anyway small or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. Since 2017 they are regarded as "endangered", stage two of the IUCN -scale. Largest threat is the Balkans -Miniermotte beside a fungus. It spreads from south-eastern Europe over the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe on less than 10,000 specimens. In this assessment the trees in cities, parks and avenues are not taken into account.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
More than a fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We must limit human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
34 people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the information, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The earthquake of magnitude 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is regarded as particularly earthquake-endangered. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the anatolian earth plate.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
On Tuesday, an earthquake of 4.6 had already shaken the region around Istanbul. Authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American Bundesliga football finals Super Bowl. That ’ s what the singers announced on Twitter. “It won ’ t be bigger, ” Shakira wrote in a photo of himself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be time in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky during the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists for 100 years and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly wait "to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
In a statement, Shakira pointed out that she felt honored to be on one of the largest stages in the world alongside another artist and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" were on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling spectators
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American Bundesliga Football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you have recently dropped audience numbers: This February, the spectacle attracted the least viewers in the USA for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been turmoil in the run-up to the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl: According to media reports last February, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform in the quarterback dispute with Colin Kaepernick. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, at the time quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had fallen to his knees in the 2016 / 17 season in front of NFL matches at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick triggered a movement with his protest, numerous players took the gesture. This caused great excitement, US president Donald Trump attacked the mostly Afro-American football champions sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unanimous since March 2017 and has not contested any NFL match. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: hotels get money from the insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of the travel agent Thomas Cook. There is a risk of high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse, the Financial Times writes, is also affected by this.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would have to make amortization of up to GBP 1.8 billion (around EUR 2 billion) on their books, according to the report. This would have been shown by the advisory firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to accept depreciation of £900 million to £1 billion and the lenders between £550 and £825 million. Indeed, the amounts to be depreciated are more likely to come at the top of the bandwidth, an expert told the paper.
How big the losses of the creditors in the end will actually be, will show itself after expiration of the insolvency procedure. A person close to this procedure did not disperse too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 planes of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the real estate are in bad locations. Probably the most money can be brought out with the sale of the airport Slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete allegedly brought murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have taken men to Italy, who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have secure information on it," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation, Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency AP.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They were accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they had left on their ships. "They come without passports".
On 29 June, Carola Rackete had illegally taken migrants to the port of Lampedusa and rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects also arrived there. Investigations are underway against the captains for aid to illegal immigration.
United States warn Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt "with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such inquiries, "continues the FCC CEO, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of confidence" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to try first to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" with reference to own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G's technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC's head continues.
He accuses the Chinese group Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the employee company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, "said Pai to the" Handelsblatt ".
The US had knowledge that government officials were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin to promote the US position.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
During the night local residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened on Friday as a precautionary measure, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injured. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals indoors, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still the risk that smell would spread after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 policemen and gendarmes were deployed at the fire site.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
According to authorities, the Normandy factory belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams against the pollution had been built up, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at around 2: 40 a.m., reported the authorities. At first, the cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany needs to invest now, the sooner the better, ” Le Maire said on Thursday evening when presenting the French budget for next year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse to take the necessary decisions ".
Action would have to be taken by those states that have budgetary scope for more investment, said Le Maire, with a view to Germany, among other things.
France has no room for manoeuvre, the Minister added, pointing to his country ’ s high public debt, which is more than 98% of gross domestic product. French public debt must be “stabilised ” and“ lowered, ” said Le Maire.
In recent years, appeals have repeatedly come from France to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than EUR 9 billion for households.
The French government is thus responding to the protests of the Yellow-West movement, among other things. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2% this year, according to an expected 3.1%.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson evades question on Brexit ’ s tactic
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "capitulation law" passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British prime minister to avoid chaos Brexit. Critics fear, however, that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, however, the Tory politician evades.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit, despite the law most recently passed by Parliament, which is to prevent it. To answer a question, Johnson just told journalists that his government will abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that would make negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law to the post-EU exit period. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson ’ s chief advisor Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said that he felt that Brexit was a “walk in the park ” and expressed confidence that the EU ’ s aspiration to leave the park would still come about:“ We enjoy that, we will win, we will leave the park (note: out of the EU), no concern, ” said Cummings, according to the British newspaper Telegraph, at a book presentation.
Cummings, who headed Brexit ’ s “Vote Leave ” campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now serving as the chief strategist in the UK ’ s government headquarters, and is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a seemingly hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the biggest rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) immerses deeply into the very private world of McCartney's family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's front woman Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of Polaroid films."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids did it, some hundred of them are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course there is always one in the center: your husband Paul - as you might never have seen him before.
There he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, telephoning a bathrobe with a bag on his head, or wearing unformed moonboots. Sure, the McCartney were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlight on her farm in southern England or Scotland she also had a very normal life. Thus, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it wasn ’ t always cleaned up at McCartney ’ s.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid is capturing the immediate moment. Linda McCartney ’ s shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It ’ s about the decision click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to knip it in exactly the right moment, ” said Paul McCartney. “If you knip two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. ” And Linda would have had the gift to always capture the right moment.“ She just knew she has it, ” said Paul in the Eshun ’ s essay.
The light, the composition, the cut-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles' fans, but in addition to everything anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also look like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the newly released Beatles' album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
In spite of the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "Erdogan said in New York, where he participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian petroleum, as some companies had "withdrawn due to US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran particularly on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not adhering to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran ’ s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
US Government wants to restrict refugee reception
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US State Department stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The State Department said that the US would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
In the future, the US government intends to focus on the reception of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be accepted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The programme, which was launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The 18,000 refugees ceiling for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current 30,000 ceiling is already low. When US President Donald Trump ’ s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
Humanitarian organizations responded horribly to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Trudeau. The US would thereby further damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is strictly limiting immigration to the US, both legally and illegally. According to his own statements, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Close to a Spigot"
United States President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has hinted to the informant who accused him of abuse of power, “comes close to a spike, ” Trump said, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday.
When he was asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, “This comes close to a spike. ” Trump then added,“ Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. Spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a bit differently than we do now. ”
Observers evaluated the latter ’ s comment on a possible allusion to the death penalty. Democrats strongly criticised Trump ’ s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. Moreover, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Intelligence Services and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote that it was an attempt to obstruct a Congress investigation into a possible impeachment of the death penalty.
The whistleblower accuses the President of abusing his office in a now published complaint asking another country to intervene in the US 2020 election. Specifically, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation, Trump suggested that he initiate investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe ∑ and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and toddlers drowning in Aegean
Time and again, people try to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. At the same time, the often far too small boats capsized regularly. At the sinking of a inflatable boat, seven migrants have died - including five children.
Seven migrants were killed in front of the Greek island of Chios. Among the victims of the deaths were a baby and four other children, the Greek coastguard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. Migrants had departed from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Up to now, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in too small boats. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The Who break off concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has come to a jähes end because of an inconvenience of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the gig on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed the service. On the eighth song Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running".
Lead's guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey could "not speak now". Townsend promised the audience to get his money's worth at a redress concert. However, an appointment is not yet fixed.
The Who will be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74 year-old band mate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork threatens to disturb the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. Just a few days ago, the company had dismissed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British "Financial Times" reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, among other things in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it to members in small units at short notice. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far WeWork burns money with this business at breathtaking speed. Last year the company entered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone the rental costs by renting ever new large areas are estimated to have increased to 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, almost 300,000 square meters of office space over the past 24 months. WeWork ’ s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas on the market at that time. Without WeWork ’ s expansion, the office would have increased vacancy in the US metropolis during this time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider ”. Similarly, it looks like in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in a prime location.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be shifted noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have rebuilt their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions of dollars. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork usually takes place by each specially established subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only within narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a total of 262 poachers who have been illegally fishing in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian internal intelligence service FSB of the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Prior to that, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time, there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters, where Russia ’ s coastguard patrol their marine biological resources according to its own data. 30,000 octopuses were discovered in the new inspections. Furthermore, according to the data, three fishermen and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the coastguard recorded a total of more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, the media have been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries and Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently complained of high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be decomposed. Even the ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian coastguard were injured during the last week ’ s arrests. According to the FSB, another wounded North Korean died later from his injuries. On that September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after the fire had opened.
United States impose embarkation ban against former President Castro
The United States has imposed a ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, and the US Department of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Thursday stating that Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he has a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations by the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump issued a ban on entry on Wednesday, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduros ’ s government to bring him to his knees and to give power to the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduros ’ closest allies. Venezuela ’ s Caribbean socialist island receives oil in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secretaries to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents.
New Climate Protocol from Fridays for Future
Today, one week after the largest international climate rotests, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. The beginning is likely to be due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia before the protests across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more than four million people struck for the climate. We'll do it again this Friday!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries in the framework of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates from Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on their country ’ s politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. From this, within a short period of time, the Fridays were created for the Future Movement. In particular, students and students participate in the climate revolution, but also scientists and other adults are increasingly participating.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global heating and the impending climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York just under a month after a two-week transatlantic trip with a high-seas race-yacht. There she had recently participated in climate rotests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she held an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth urgently in conscience. In her homeland Stockholm she had been awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation for her commitment to more climate protection on Wednesday.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony, which is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow according to the Tass Agency.
Those who smoke nonetheless have to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the same burning candles are prohibited. Barbecuing meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Slap against cybercriminals - Investigators lift out servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as operators of a data centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben and Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally active criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Attorney General ’ s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest darknet market place for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker according to the Prosecutor General's Office.
It was said that such a hoster had been excavated for the first time in Germany. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It was the result of nearly five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
Fridays for Future ’ s New Global Climate Protocol
Today, one week after the largest international climate rotests, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protector Who are Thunbergs backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. All the more astonishing is that a sixteen-year-old girl of all things holds the mirror in front of the people of power of this time. But what is behind it? Is it a helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to gain an accumulation of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a fairer world. At that time, he could also win a host of young people for himself and this persuaded them to cross the sea in order to get to the promised land, similar to Greta Thunberg's recent trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this respect? Why does a share called "We don't have time" need to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold itself extensively, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also well-established followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR and / or the trip with the boat was probably too thick also some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into effect very well in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now divided: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in the rescue of the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stock brokers during the world campaign? No matter which position is ultimately taken into consideration, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore it can make sense to critically question also seemingly pious plans of certain trend setter.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet at the moment crosses our solar system.
The assumptions of astronomers have been confirmed: a strange comet at the moment crosses our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star crosses our solar system at the moment. It was baptized after its explorer 2I / Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope towards the sky and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet, which does not originate from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind, which was sighted during transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get close insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and currently moves on a so-called hyperbola path that leads it out of our system.
Comet was already seen before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe him in detail, because in contrast to his predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on Comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our colleague Javier Licandro, added de León.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may permit a new way of researching certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently a giant Asteroid rested past the earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson appalled at brother
Only his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges with clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", "Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is getting up to date - at least verbally. At the question time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, other critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News, her brother uses words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal were to be "hung, pulled along, quartered, tarred and cushioned." She considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She does not recognize the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken up the anti-Brexit party "Change UK" in the EU Parliament elections.
In particular, she found out that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons who had been murdered by a neo-Nazis a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their memory could best be honoured by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very tasty to refer to a deputy murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," criticized Johnson's sister. The culprit obviously came out of the far-right camp, which feels "reinforced by this kind of language." For all those who mourned for her, it was very tasty.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he answered. The best way to honor them was to stand passionately and resolutely for what one believes in - no matter what view one is. But never should one "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson had resigned his younger brother Jo as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory deputy. "I was torn in the past few months between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson justified the move.
Johnson ’ s language also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is “unworthy of this country. ” In a joint statement they said:“ In recent days, the language has not been acceptable both in debates and outside Parliament. We should speak with respect to each other. ”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is setting a strong signal: in the mid-season show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino ’ s roots appear, promising “an explosion of fun and energy. ”
The super stars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the upcoming finals of the US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino premier community next to JLo, because it has incredible strength in the US," Shakira said in a video.
The finals of the American Football League, which will be celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of pure Korean origin.
"I love the Super Bowl putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas", Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000ies she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" great hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the US every time. This year, many consider the choice to be a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump ’ s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. Usually, far more than 100 million television viewers watch the NFL finals, it is also very popular in Germany now.
There were political controversies in the run-up last year. The reason for this was the quarterback dispute with Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up to play the national anthem in protest against police violence, and for which, among other things, had been hard approached by US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber admits Egypt ’ s ruler: but Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who have had an impact on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them hovered back to Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who in 2013 dismissed the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s Mohammed Morsi, the country ’ s first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis ’ s action against political Islam and had not lost a syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile – in a week in which Egypt ’ s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the President. He had “no reason to worry, ” said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television.“ The Egyptians cannot be misled. ”
In the opinion of the president, Ali tries to mislead the other man, who is currently determining what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained abroad, of course, where he escapes the access of the security forces, which would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice, which dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and tea rooms of the country: with his YouTube channel "Mohammed's secrets" Ali calls his fellow countrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president indulge in luxury and let himself be built magnificent new palaces, it is said. Ali accuses corruption and enrichment of the army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule. Because he did business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second occupation as a building contractor, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least this is the impression of many Egyptians, as the downright exploding clicks show.
After last week, for the first time since Sisis ’ s grip on power, thousands of people had demonstrated against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a “millions march ” for this Friday. That really so many people would venture on the streets was unlikely. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo as well as in the place of Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. At first, these videos could not be independently verified.
On Friday, a massive police presence was reported from the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators torn banners with the portrait of the president in pieces last week. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads. In Cairo, several underground railway stations in the city center were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around Tahrirplatz, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa, where supporters of the truncated Muslim Brotherhood Mursi were stranded in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontent from gathering: Sisis ’ s future party wanted to hold a rally for the president here, of all things.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrirplatz", Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not collide with police officers". As a retreat this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different test possibilities.
Who concludes an Internet contract, does not need to trust blindly the speed data of the offerers. Customers can check in case of abnormalities, how much of it is actually achieved.
After all, the pre-promised transfer rates are an integral part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Association.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different test possibilities. The measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the offerers take place however according to offerer-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated", gives the Bavarian side to consider.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable time limit of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. Affected parties best do this in writing by login letter.
If this does not affect anything even after multiple requests, customers can terminate and under certain circumstances also demand compensation. However, if there is no success, only the way of action will help.
First ranking Republican for Investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out in favour of an impeachment offensive investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are found," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action - an impeachment may lead to the removal of the president.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe ∑ in Ukraine, because Trump has been "for years".
Republicans have hitherto withheld criticism of Trump ’ s whistleblower affair; few have shown unease about it. Scott ’ s statements are a first sign of this in Trump ’ s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump ’ s policies, such as easing environmental legislation and tightening up immigration rules.
Spider And Man Remains at MCU: Further Marvel And Film Planned
It was a shock for all Spider ´ s Man ´ s fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland ´ s Spider ´ s Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" -Universe. It was completely unclear how the films were to continue around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider is coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) for another final third film after "Spider's Man: Homecoming" and "Spider's Man: Far From Home". This is reported by several US media. According to this, the cinema launch is to be established: the film will start in the USA from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel and Kevin Feige are quoted: "I am glad that Spideys way is continued in the MCU. I and all at the Marvel and I are delighted that we can continue to work on it... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey and Verses. You never know what the future will bring".
But how does the sudden good news come about? Sony Marvel is alleged to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would contribute 30 percent to the revenue of Spider ’ s coming. However, the news is not confirmed.
So duchess and prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has meanwhile reached the grand finale. In the last episode, there were many happy ends and just as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his dealer (38), who took part in the series for many years, were charmingly paid tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers to the series finale.
One thing in advance: in the final, Duchess Trudeau did not return for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects showed once again the most memorable scenes with today ’ s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his imprisonment.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned casually in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking straight towards the altar to marry his fiancé Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a very telling remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw himself over a walking skirt, the fucking Harvey wants to know from the groom, just to make a sneak comment: "Louis, you are not the prince of England".
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown at boat crash
When capturing a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children drowned. Altogether, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coastguard announced on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Trudeau has now announced his intention to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU commissioner, he wanted to inform himself in Turkey "about the refugee situation", said Netanyahu on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help in the management.
On Friday, a spokesperson for the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, unusually many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does Turkey ’ s Deal still work?
The increased figures recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016, which stipulates that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants arriving illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each Syrian deported.
However, due to lack of personnel, asylum applications are progressing laboriously on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29 400 people are waiting for Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst thing is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the EU ’ s entry into force in March 2016, Turkey ’ s refugee pact had been so many, the state broadcasting system reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical experts, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "quite certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart's circulation system made high temperatures and large temperature shifts within a short time and led to increased heart attacks. Especially people with heart's circulation are affected, elderly people and diabetics.
Green politician has to be responsible for embarrassing photo pot
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Leader holds in his hand a multiplier cup in a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa / Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed nevertheless. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee mug with metal straw in her hand. On the party's website she was shown in a photo with this mug, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there the mug was still a frightening (Papp) mug, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green leader must be responsible for photography
As a result, the National Post accused May of manipulation and that the party produced fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", right in the middle of an election campaign for the House of Commons, in which it has become increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and raised the discussion about fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and asserted on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. In order to underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, he, she correctly, was made of bamboo. She always had it with him. A spokesperson of the party said that it was only a matter of putting the party logo in the picture and not of covering up something. Of the photo, only one detail can be seen on the website.
May writes that she is suffering for the employee who has done that. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and asked for something from her over-committed team: "If they want to work on a picture again, then they could not do something with my face, so that I look younger?"
The German Greens have also fallen into Shitstorms because of their use of one-way plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the boss of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream on vacation with plastic spoons, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was said to have been promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked for it during the check in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly again with Cathay.
Spontaneously getting an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at the check in offer a change from Economy Class free of charge.
This case shows, however, how it should not be done: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users follow Instagram. On May 30 she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outbound flight, Jaqueline staff refused to upgrade, although she had presented an email in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade, which the influencerin wants to receive from a marketing assistant of the airline. Jaqueline, on the other hand, accused the airline of having forged the mail.
On the return flight Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman is supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they looked after the headquarters. And actually the employee, from whom the mail allegedly originated, denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. That also confirmed the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
The airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) they had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Cathay had reimbursed her for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencerin has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. Furthermore, the terms and conditions of the airline state that they do not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now switches on a lawyer.
Oil prices report on ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon in the shortest possible time. Finally, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen triggered the price slide. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had killed five percent of the world ’ s oil production. Iran ’ s allied Huthi rebels in Yemen ’ s civil war had claimed the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, it could focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the Raw Materials Strategy Division at Bloomberg ’ s Saxo Bank.
Oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
Bloomberg recently reported, citing insiders, that repairing oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September was faster than thought. Accordingly, the production volume has returned to a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting rapid progress on the repair work of Saudi Aramco, a state-owned oil company. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release. Now, the crew prepares the departure while the ship is still anchored, shipping chief Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS.
However, the US announced that it would transfer defense missiles and soldiers to Iran ’ s arch-enemy in Saudi Arabia. Fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Great Britain had temporarily driven up oil prices considerably in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are worsening
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, cover-up charges against the White House have become loud. Several senior officials would have worked hard to prevent access to the utterance of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. An anonymous whistleblower said that. Representative spokesperson Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat, explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers Trump and Kim ’ s third summit questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon lead to a third summit of leaders Kim Jongun and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The US has not yet done anything to implement the summit ’ s decisions last year, said the North Korean Foreign Ministry ’ s advisor. He also criticised the US sanctions and joint military manoeuvres of the US and South Korea. He hopes, however, for a “wise ” and“ courageous ” decision by Trump to bring it closer again.
On Monday, Trump said he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program have stalled in Hanoi since Trump ’ s and Kim ’ s failed second summit in February. Then, in June, they met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states, agreeing to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help with mine clearance
In Angola, British Prince Harry symbolically set fire and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue shield vest. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in Dirico, he manufactured the ignition circuit. In a safe distance, the explosive explosive explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he later called for cameras in front of on-going TV: "I call on all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who did not help with the wayside to commit themselves to help".
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of an early reduction in interest rates, the pound is losing value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon cut interest rates is due to the pound sterling, with the British currency lowered by up to 0.4 percent on Friday to $1.2269.
The sales were triggered by statements by central bankers Michael Saunders, who talked about a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty would impair the British economy for the foreseeable future. Saunders ’ s statement was surprising, as Saunders was seen as an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy caused by Brexit and Hickhack without directly signalling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to bring his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: The British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt's editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is manipulated – this is confirmed by David Howman, former Director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today ’ s Head of Integrity of the Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal are revealed in Russia - and they destroy the little credibility that the Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and only partially. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sport. Thereupon, the Wada had closed the Russian Anti-doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this period, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, the International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes of the country compete under neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cup in the various sports, in the summer even the Football World Cup with the host as participant took place in Russia.
Positive findings missing
In the following September, the Wada resumed the Rusada ’ s ban, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples in question. Data should provide information on the extent to which doping is covered up. They should help to punish athletes retrospectively. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that doping has been manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which have been mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the IAAF ’ s position: the Athletics Federation is the only organization to hold on to Russia ’ s spell. 30 Russian athletes are flying neutral at the Doha World Cup. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond within three weeks to the accusations. Russia is now threatening to re-block the Rusada and, in the worst case, to exclude the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
