Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has rejected today the proposal to derogate the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code in which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko is condemned.
The amendment would open the doors to the excarceration of the express minister, but the parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for alleged signing a disadvantaged agreement with Russia for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not firm yet, the Court of Appeal has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko showed himself convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have arisen doubts about the imparciality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code with which the former prime minister was condemned was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
There were 226 votes needed.
Victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to determine who the winner is.
As it is already usual in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it’s about diluting whether it’s moderate or radical.
The National Council of Transition has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know in some way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves will be cut the hand.
Women can already go forgotten to emancipate and the apostates wait for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, the society, composed of warrior tribes, will unite by the Qur’an.
In Libya there will be an order that we can’t even imagine and that we can’t.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably didn’t fit, instead, the already mentioned Libyans.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters would be grateful for the help of unbelievers dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians serve to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of gaining profits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem with expelling the “crossers”
But, without occupation, will the petroleum companies be able to make themselves with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may be that ultimately the West may presume of protecting human rights.
As long as the sharia followers do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe go to the search engine for investors
A statistical turbine has spread across Europe.
The individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquatrimestral period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5% and France by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany has improved more than expected (a 0.3% increase instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data talked about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew annually by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquatrimestral period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has been stagnated and according to the CSU the trend to gradual slowdown in economic growth is conformed.
The results are even worse than analysts forecasts.
The main events:
Interannual, the Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but quarterly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which meets the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has decreased by 5.2 per cent annually.
The interest of their ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish bonuses has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the ten-year Czech bonds remain at 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany there are voices that say that the ECB should grant loans ultimately.
The Czechs are classified for the Euro Cup.
They won 1-0 and celebrated the ranking with a prize of 200 million.
The football team meets the hardest task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant porter Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second time, defended himself fantasticly from the local team's attacks, so it won't miss the European Championship quotation.
IHNED.cz detailedly followed the development of the party in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the final, and also the excellent match of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the Championship of Europe.
Due to the correct Czech defense, the Montenegro did not press until the second half.
The two damaged were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who left two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the genius Petr Cech, the 11 Czechs will not miss the European Cup date, so the national football arches will get an approximately 200 million crown gratification.
In the first few minutes, a good offensive game was played.
Both teams struggled only to keep the lines and played nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, patadons to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundreds of university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began praying on Tuesday afternoon in front of the facilities and then sparked death slogans to the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundreds of university students formed human shields on Tuesday in the Iranian city of Isfahan around the nuclear technology center in which uranium is worked.
They intend to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a recent report found that Iran, according to all the indications, is seeking nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began praying in the afternoon before the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, Israeli sources said it would reach not only the Isfahan power plant, but also the facilities in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner embedded
More than a third of children aged between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity to 5%.
Obese children come from most families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current research.
It is again demonstrated what the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
On the table, obsessed children feed, for example, of embedded at least twice the frequency of children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no habit of practicing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children of Basic Education from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the “Obsity is not a coincidence” program, which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th course.
A proper diet and sufficient family exercise are determining factors, which make the number of children with overweight and even obesity significantly decreased.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals daily according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," the survey said.
No breakfast but packed for dinner
Experts warn that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, such as, for example, having a fixed hour for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren families breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each one is eating breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households nothing is breakfast.
Breakfast is the basis for a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, crazy fried potatoes are consumed much more often.
Almost all – regardless of weight – drink sweet refreshments daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, in their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study enabled the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 colleges) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from the ideal.”
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
“It’s above all alarming the popularity of sweet refreshments,” the study’s final report says.
As the main food, the palm is taken with the pasta and the bird meat is followed closely.
Practically, children always refuse legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changes to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after completing the prevention program ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’, a significant change was given in many cases in favour of the principles of a healthy diet,” the study notes.
Call attention, for example, about sweet refreshments, where many children would begin to prefer normal and current water.
Children would also often choose bird and fish for the main food in the questionnaire and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals support
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I’ve already complained a little that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Conference of three branch professionals, how to dress up problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course develops every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a filler.
We’ve been studying with the director, Alena, (in the course there’s no man) about how to dress the woman who doesn’t have a perfect symmetry.
That is the vast majority.
Someone is hollow, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers from overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften broad shoulders, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves.
We have given some tricks about how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer López, with huge breasts and heads but narrow belt and at the same time not dress it in a way too challenging.
If, for example, the difference between the ceiling and the ceiling is so much that the fold or pants are not adapted, it is worth cutting at least one extra piece of custom fabric.
You will surely not regret, because the clothes you feel perfectly is impagable.
With a custom fold you will feel much better than with one that doesn’t stop moving, rise up, dancing on the belt, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with plugs, ornaments, bordered or drapeated.
There are many different types of information and bodies, so I’m happy that I have the whole week to put order in my head all this information.
And even so, I am afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than over.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, to whom he will have to design two dresses: one for the day and another for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current aspect, the fashion style that fits the person in question.
I've got to "wear" Miranda Kerr, you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it’s much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently will have fat about a hundred pounds (please keep in mind the exaggeration), or the youngest Selena Gómez.
The clothes we have to cut them out of the magazines or search them on the internet and print them, to then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is how the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, does not only wear physically, but also occupies, for example, the product pages in the magazines (of concrete topics, such as trends, pockets, shelves, etc.).
This is the story of designer and stylist Mario Kameník.
But all this is left for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three special guests encouraged the Saturday conference with information about all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same clothes in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to the classic with cowboys and shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with shirt shoes and photograph it as if it was actually a dress.
Or it’s enough to throw it up and raise the neck to get a completely different image.
“Jug with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
“Then you can break them,” said Jacob.
Finally I’m clear why we remember all those formulas, what’s combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those that are used in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style make them alone, in many cases, the half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not precisely an extraordinary singer, but the image and the markete have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is no clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we have to keep in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a very different size than their real (minor).
Then it’s just guglear and to find out if the heart magazines have already written about the topic, if a certain celebrity has fattened/weighted, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient in fashion, but he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not miss, he defends his opinions.
“When a director contracts you to classify the dress and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t take and throw all that was and say, ‘Hey, what horror.’”
"Find at least a couple of things you can consider and recommend so that someone can put them," says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the job stock.
This is fixed around the belt and there are all the necessary tools.
There are also nailon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as pockets or hates), special clothing stickers in front, if this is bigger (the stickers and other types of stickers are not permitted, because they could damage the tissue), or a costume game.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something in practice, we have learned to cover the soil of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the soil could be damaged and much more the outside.
And we did nothing more than coating and coating.
We couldn’t touch the shoes with the tires so we couldn’t hurt them by accident.
He had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy by praising my work without reservations.
I don’t get that skills very well.
This is just a small part of all that we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that dedicating myself to stylism at a professional level is not a pink way, but it gives me exactly the same as people say.
Need for Speed: The Run is competing throughout America.
Review
A journey, in principle neglected, is complicated due to a series of unfair neglect of a routine journey during the turn of tomorrow.
In a certain extent it was achieved to cover expectations, but this does not serve anything, if, in reality, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new release, to which the title is added to The Run, awakened great expectations before its premiere.
He promised it would give new aires to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as shown, appears as a game that shouldn’t end up being again a genre of action without more.
We also feel curious to know how the inserted scenes would be left, where the main character descends from the car and walks by his own foot.
As it usually happens in the NFS series, the results don’t vary much compared to what we expected.
There are races that can be given as acceptable, but in the total computing points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, errors cannot be called, but it’s rather the incomprehensible failure of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit on the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are localized in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
It is nothing of the other world.
But walking through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Moreover, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sand storm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to this, each of the races is well developed.
There are only a few models, but that is enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a number of rivals required (the normal in a classic race), then you try to win time (chronometrated classic duel) and then you are waiting for a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes appears the police, which does not only make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are a lot less landscapes in the game than you could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not get to be annoying and, in the already mentioned context, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a great thing, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can now look elsewhere.
But a fairly action-conceived race is quite suitable for this style of driving, although we will be able to find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same thing is no longer happening with collisions.
From games of this type you can’t expect to recre deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you can’t predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or circulating the car with a normal traffic, there are only light rocks, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled piruetes.
Or it ends completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in bad mood.
The resetings are scheduled in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or you leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five resets available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it’s nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it’s not very reliable.
Sometimes, neither reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you crazy especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your contrincant advances without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or freeze.
It’s the same when you arrive, because it’s scheduled because the “surprise” will always happen in front of your nose.
The opponents also have another advantage.
During the whole game you will get to sites where, without taking into account the moment, you will always advance the same opponent on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front, so at the beginning you can make the car papilla.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you immediately.
And it’s a pity, because although the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what’s happening or where.
And it really doesn’t matter if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the ranking in the race so that you don’t get bored, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the races.
You have to be attentive to the gas pipes next to the road, because just there you have to change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you will be enough what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic super sports for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
In addition to the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in concrete places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and stories.
At the top level, the driver opens several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last career in history is made.
With the car you get to the tunnel of the metro (pass), where you get to run in the dark through the roads (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the metro convoy reaches you behind and takes you in front without more.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of bubbles.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a sadness that, in the most tensive moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This affects primarily the accidents where there are many participants involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of tastes.
In order to be pleasant to most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "every one of his father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely foolish errors, we would have trouble saying that The Run is the best NFS game of the last few years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is secured, but prepare because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of an airport reflector.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativists and eurosceptics.
“The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions.”
“I didn’t expect a war without a quarter.”
“It will take five or six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms and the new players get used to their new roles,” the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began his conference at the Faculty of Law.
How not to take seriously his motto "clear and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, since it would be the envy of many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of U. Carolina.
Vicenová also considered the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“The first thing arises the criticism, that if it is insulse, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles to perfection.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, how to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new position of representative of Foreign Policy and Security is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? to what number can I call it?".This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union in the face of states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also engaged in the agenda followed, followed and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs took care of the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good hole", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, it is necessary to approve the EU’s seven-year budget, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which less?
The ambassador also reminded her main motto, with which she arrived in Europe: "About Europe with clarity."
“The truth is that I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreigners or jergas that people don’t understand.”
“How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the curved or round pepins, bananas of various sizes, or that no one will prohibit us from Olomouc cheese, are not really invented?”
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of the Speed
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of eurosceptic and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive.
He also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is of a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“I believe that when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a French next to me says, ‘What, have you left, those of the Visegrad Group?’ and it is seen that it does not make any grace to him.”
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, awaits new hard budget policy regulations for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new of the "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen space and we also have the process of strengthened cooperation.”
“It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, let them stay out.”
“These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the two-speed Europe,” Vicenová expects.
In this sense, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
The Brand Story:
IBM starts its second century existence
If someone sought a term that defines IBM’s strategy with great accuracy, the most approximate would be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has already passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-local character was placed by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He has already swallowed the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which he will build the life of the giant future (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it kept faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current CEO of the company.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, worried about the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Baťa in Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first U.S. operators to enjoy paid holidays, secure, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that awards the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication isined by IBM in the customer relationship.
Already from the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (because it was one of the first world companies to end any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, by which Palmisano will be replaced by a woman next year: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
In recent years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, the rain of online ideas, from which infinity of future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that ideas survive, as half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBMined a concept of institution rather than technological enterprise,” says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony from Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develop both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It has the largest number of patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial permuts, bar codes and disquets.
This year it has become the second technological firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Looking at the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on advancing, you can’t emotionally anchor yourself in the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
That’s why IBM has no problems building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, it leaves them).
And this is the difference of the competition, Microsoft, which is basicallyined and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the Future
In terms of sales, IBM is dedicated primarily to services, of which approximately a fifth is from programs and another fifth is from equipment.
However, even in 1990 the teams represented more than half of the share of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-performance assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have followed since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was manifested for the first time.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the big economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the company IBM has been able to cope the crisis.
The value of IBM’s shares since the beginning of the year 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has not ceased to rise.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
We can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will survive.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutting Machine to Space Flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, with its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 – originally it was a brand used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The base that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies that come back to the 1880s.
It possessed inventions such as the famous "chip clock", which allows to control the entrance and exit of employees.
The new company's architect was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also presided over his supervisory board.
Flint filed the head of a competitive company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company’s management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm base on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of appliances for business, from meat and cheese cuts to register boxes.
During the first four years Watson led the company, the billing doubled by $9 million and began the company’s great expansion across the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, almost after forty years occupying the chairman's seat, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360.
The classics "peace", which introduced the computer standard of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, by its part, acquired the consultancy part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering full advice and high added value services.
The strategy that IBM has paid these last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, i.e., “a smarter planet.”
Its objective is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not been improved, for example, in relation to transport and city administration.
For the trade sector, IBM recently presented the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the full trading cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932, she opened a branch in the former Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today here, the IBM ČR also operates the strategic externalization center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here there is a world-famous research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářova about his unfaithful husband:
“Iveta, stay with that fool, I don’t love him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it was over!
After his husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also his lover, Darina was still hoping that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can go home, but no longer as my partner,” Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové in her house during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not leave the singer.
She even declared publicly that she loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn’t care who his wife is with.
If one day Rychtář broke with Bartošova, his wife would not expect him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out.”
"But here I would live not as my beloved and old borric who was wrong, but as a man to whom I have certain bonds," Rychtářova said, adding that he had already dismissed his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
To Joseph so far it doesn’t matter if a woman has closed the door behind him.
“I accept my wife’s decision.”
“I’ll be with Iveta and there’s no change possible.”
“My wife established this as a marriage on the paper and I respect it.”
“The company remains in force, I make the home arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I make the purchases.”
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtář said.
If Rychtář had found a new love, he would not oppose.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care me, nor where she goes, nor if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I assume all the responsibility,” Josef concludes.
The worst victims of women: Are they also referred to you?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vicies of women, generally each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are quoted that succeed in making the blood bear men?
Go to shopping
Do you reproach your average orange that you have dependence on purchases?
Should you buy at least one trapito a week?
Do you like to buy often at discounts?
Then in your case you can say that going shopping has become a vicious.
Some women realize they should calm their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But to see, which woman could resist the temptation to walk without more through the clothing stores, look for well-adjusted clothes and then try them all on the test (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women going shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve told your partner that it’s best to wait for her in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
“I’m not too thick?”
"I would need to lose weight at least five pounds - should I start doing exercise?"
“Do you really like it?”
Do you not hear these phrases?
What is yes?
So she is one of those women obsessed by her appearance.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listen to your partner complaining all the time of your physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning first.
It’s like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, pass the aspirator, frog the ground, remove the dust, frog the bathroom and all that at least twice a week.
Are you reproaching your partner to have stepped the clean ground with a dirty foot, to your children who have dirty a newly cleaned washroom and a shelf with glass doors that it was so expensive to clean?
In case you suffer from this "divergence", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleaning should not occupy being primordial in the family.
This harmless desire for cleaning could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
“The used socks are left with dirty clothes.”
“You want to wear those shoes tomorrow too.”
“The wet trap is not left on the ground!”
If you do those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that you will get it out of your boxes.
You don’t want to say anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Per, if men knew this, women, on their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and Chisms
Some women are also affected by calumnias, jokes, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together of things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Per each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless shock.
With the hand in the heart, this is characteristic of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are shismose women of those who don’t control themselves, who love shismore and often do it, disregard everyone and are dangerous for those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jagr and Voráček helped with their assistance to win Philadelphia
Hockey frontman Jaromír Jágr took part on Monday in the NHL match with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina field and again put the Czech players in the avant-garde of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and made a step further and was declared the best player in the game.
Two assistants were awarded in the match and the Jagiellonian colleague, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to the ultramar journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I had already told him before the match that he would do a triple."
“I presented it.”
"Sometimes they seem emboscated," Jágr explained, after his performance gave him a goal to Giroux, following the first flagship.
A while later, the team’s second intervention also had a Czech trace.
Voráček made the album behind the Hurricanes port and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he set the third goal, after his shot collapsed by the fourth of the Wayne Simmonds portier.
“I love to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the field, but he's among the three best," Jagr told his headquarters.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
“I am very pleased with it.”
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results,” Jágr added.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again of Dwyer, of penalti, until putting himself to a goal of distance.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, although they ended overcome in number two against one.
“Pronger had a good performance in our field.”
“He turned off the album, I took speed and Read went to the distant side.”
"I tried to touch him on the disc and I'm happy because I've achieved it," Voráček described the last goal of the match as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has become the head of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender, Jaroslav Špaček, didn't play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retreated for a injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defense experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec didn’t know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach regretted the great number of injured in the last row, and played the match only with five defences.
“This is bad.”
“We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels.”
“In the end, but it’s that nothing can be done against that, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
“We had to simplify the game even more, get the disc out of our field.”
“And so we leave holes,” explained one of the defences, P. K. Subban.
The goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed with thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over the Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were marked by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the Czech Republic: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist block, since trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists were therefore on vacation to the beaches of the RDA (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period comprised between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime slept to the west and the travel of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist block (i.e., also the Czechoslovak) were not allowed to travel freely and individually nor even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise, the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies offered in those times also travel to the West, but one should put on the tail with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have “good acquaintances” in the agency.
But not everything was won.
The so-called "changing promise" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czech currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there was a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The way of traveling the Czechs has suffered since 1989 an authentic revolution.
While until 1989 for us was the no longer will pass the holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holidays to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which today we are no longer aware, the fact that to the currently favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 it could not travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia of then.
At the beginning of the 90s the visa exemption was imposed to travel to the neighboring countries of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, didn’t look tired of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the groups of Checs slept in parks in campaign stores, as our income from then did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Checs of that time was taking food (conserves, embedded, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our living level increased and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, the agencies began, from 1997 regularly, to prepare the trips using charter flights connections, which made the prices of the trips incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of getting discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90s of the past century, Czechs already traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the U.S., which made our trips even more simplified.
Another interesting moment in the post-revolutionary tourism history happened in 2000, when, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights starts every year with Czech tourists made distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. eliminated the visa for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have spent on travel abroad more than 15 thousand Czech crowns per head, including the expenses on the stay site.
Ordinary General Assembly to elect the president, which could end again in dead point.
For almost five months the Czech football has been without president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will not be known even after the call for the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, there has not yet been an agreement on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, you cannot vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Interested in presiding the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his office in June not without before calling his colleagues with the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to take care of football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era ended, a controversy arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was revealed on September 16 when the new president was elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the conversations had been blocked and not just as to the method of election.
There was no consensus on who in the General Assembly had the right to vote — only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment and due to this single point, a partial agreement was made, supported also by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes on the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation was no longer able to throw even the Executive Committee which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion about the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is the following: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The dispute turns around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who, from the leadership of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will submit his candidacy.
The Moravia Region is willing to reach a commitment so that it can win that candidate with a greater total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have the majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of bicameral system," so Svoboda understands the objections of the morava side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees with this, although it is supposed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
“I would like to vote to the maximum in accordance with the statutes.”
“To make no foolishness about the representatives as in the last General Assembly,” says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who first postulates as a candidate and who directs his observations primarily against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk the new president will be decided and he believes the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All the passions will be calmed with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
“Football will again be the protagonist, and so cooperate more to taste,” says Jablonice’s representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
“I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated.”
“It’s not a conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
“This can result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.”
“In any case, I hope the common sense will be imposed,” Rajchl said.
There is no longer a long time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice-president Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not gone this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the classification match will take place.
Per the decisive meeting, eventually, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to incorporate the parties divided into the country’s most powerful sports organization so that an agreement could be reached.
There is a lot in play: the state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czech Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will struggle for the presidency, because he doesn’t find a better candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an adequate candidate that satisfied all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not present himself as a candidate to such a relevant position.
“If there was a right person, I would be struggling for her and I’t present me as a candidate for the election.”
"But until today we have not been able to find such a person," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, in case of victory, he would remain in the post of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I could take into account.”
"For me it was a madness to hear some say that at this moment they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
“I would like to change that vision,” he adds.
What supposedly most annoys Paclík at this time is the relationship of Pelta with the President of the Regional Football Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential chair.
“If he wins, the status will remain in place and nothing in football will change.”
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious business man, football will make even less profit," Paclík said.
It also mentioned the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out impune.
"I don't know what prestige to football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes the UEFA and FIFA will look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that "will sell the Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday’s elections, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first to follow.”
“He is very capable.”
“I could imagine it, for example, as the head of the representation.”
“But not as a manager of an association.”
"I also don't put my nose there where I don't feel capable," Paclík added, who in September raised a lot of attention to support the suspension of the Arbitration Commission presided by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He recurs to his management capabilities of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of the Pilsen, who with his support celebrated in May the triumph in first division.
“I have the strength to change some things in football and contribute to its safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies to Sparta president Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exercised pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport than the lottery taxes.
“This is one of the key issues to which the new president should be devoted.”
"If they raise the gambling taxes, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money will stop," she said.
Moreover, Paclík now does not even take into account his partnership with the Club Pilsner, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "not party".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
“It is not ideal.”
"But I don't see sense to hypocritically give my actions from the Pilsen Club to another person and then return there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised to the FAČR new statutes that would end with the dead point of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in case of being elected, it would guarantee that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve definitively to solve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral regulation.
Jablonec’s representative is optimistic about the Thursday meeting in Nymburk, and believes the pre-electoral conflict could advance towards a solution today with the possible football team’s victory.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of being elected, precisely on the representation and on collecting funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could go well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
“People at all levels have been engaged in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new President this Thursday.”
“They feel it’s time for someone to manage the association,” the man thinks who associates primarily with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euforia that ruled in the time of Ivan Hašek.
Sadly, in the June General Assembly were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
“If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,” Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a snorkel to win the delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond if this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, it tries not to interfere with its opponents.
In the past, he had warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It took a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave titer with head.
“It takes more than a year in the world of football, and it has already achieved some success.”
"Their attacks but were shameful and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign."
"Therefore many of them doubt about their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the higher competitions.
The latter should be a football promotion equipment.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose due to the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year.”
"I would immediately then engage in negotiations with the public and private sector, to make sure there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told CTK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal modification of the staff.
"It would have to know first the tasks of each employee," he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, implies a understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that vaticine before the next general assembly, he believes the delegates will not travel empty this Thursday to Nymburk.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will surely succeed in overcoming it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only be recovered if it finally has a leader," yet two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would begin to work with desire.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current vice president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, a lot of people would surely show resent.
Rajchl promises that, if he is elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the executive committee members responsible for each field of football individually.
He also undertakes to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue with the work initiated by former President Ivan Hašek.
“As a president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the team, through professional football or training of high-performance young footballers.”
"With this I don't mean I'd do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s competences in such a way that each member can devote himself to a specific area.”
“And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of impulse.”
“Many people will probably don’t like this because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticize the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, it is said that it has considered the possibility of not presenting itself again as a candidate.
“Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder every step," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
“Many people have told me that I should not give myself for defeated, because then the others would be defeated as well.”
“It’s about having faith not to abandon so, without more,” he said.
According to them, he also motivates him to continue the work he already started with Hašek.
“Thro those two years, a large part of the work has been completed and I don’t want it to be lost now.”
“There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I’t want someone to stop them,” he said concerned by the fact that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before the Hašek era.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
“Behind him is above all that people who would take care of football so that it was just a privilege for a few elected.”
“You can reprove me a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make a football for everyone, because only so will everyone feel good and not just the elected," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be Bohemian.
"Al some people try to say the opposite, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
“For example, it’s time to think about the fact of dividing the second division into one Czech part and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division.”
"It would not be given the current situation in which we have only three Moravia teams, which represents a problem for young Moravia players," Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the pugna of presidential elections, Rajchl does not cease to believe in his possibilities of being elected.
"I still feel that I have a strong support from the Czech Federation, which has chosen me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," Rajchl said, whose successes include saving a dozen million crowns of disadvantaged contracts, television contracts negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of guilt that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to recover confidence in Czech football," he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year.”
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already begun and will not significantly change the staff staff in the committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favour,” Rajchl assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sudden baths in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can live their blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the last year and a half, there was something he couldn’t miss in his luggage, a bathroom.
Tumbed back on the water, she looked at the artistic cúpula up, swimming towards the marble angels, who were waiting for her on the edge of the pool and wondered before the modernist covered pool meticulously restored.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his booklet at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder has explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered swimming pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, and the "cotton buildings" in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the bathing culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only annoys you that bathing fans have to conform with blue blacks and chlorine heders, while running fans can breathe the fascinating smell of the abet forests or listen to the joyful trins of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why the swimming pools have to be always so ugly,” the Vienna resident says.
“I started collecting beautiful swimming pools.”
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The swimming pool and the sauna’s etheric oils. The well-being factor in the swimming pools is so large because all the senses are treated, according to Meder.
And if the constructor strives, the covered swimming pools can be a real gift for the sight: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms you have a surface of water."
“On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building.”
Everything is optically doubled: the high wheels, the colored blacks, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about the architecture and history of art in the historic oasis of well-being, but, mainly, gives desire to jump to the blue.
Meder, the swimming pool collector discovers the exemplars highlighted in her research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medical baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, the nitrate waters are found in a singular kárstic cavity (bads in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a therm, whose swimming pools are alkaline waters and are found in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: As the whole city puts the eyes on the roofed swimming pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, snow covered, from the outdoor swimming pool of a bathroom in St. Antón, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski pistes.
The design,, more extraordinary awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal's water cathedral looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open sources steam rises in winter, while from the bottom the mountains of Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
A Meder, the swimming pool collector, did not invade the odor of chlorine in all swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell to sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gasoline pest is so strong that people think they’ve come to a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legam is stick to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and sun baths in the Czech bathroom of Luhatschowitz, he met with a locked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the broken windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the malice growing among the shells.
The decadence was contrary to a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind themselves; not only can be discovered neoromanic elements of times of their construction in 1844, but not also an Arab hall of style Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its sharp modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the swimming pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
“It has a great merit to fuse different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal swimming pool apparently has no much importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the business of raw materials
by Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
of Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans don’t think it is acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global raw materials exchanges causes prices to rise, and banks take responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer defense campaign is specifically directed to Josef Ackermann, the director of the Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, betting on raw materials was thought to protect traders from price oscillations.
The main experts agree that the players have discharged from the offers and demands, and draw profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than the U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank’s directive, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s headquarters will report the consequences.
At the end it could be given a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The rising food prices bet shows in a drastic way how unhappy banks are currently damaging public well-being.”
Ackermann finds himself as the largest bank cabilder, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money on food price bets,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of the hungry people or the fame of the Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it's clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board will change something different from what was unplanned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculation can perfect your image.
And you need that you barely care about possible losses, that will be dealing with your successor.
Two-thirds will cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent found it legitimate that the Deutsche Bank would offer investments on which food prices were betting.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank participated in such: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would disadvantage a bank so to their acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflecting, to cancel their account and switch to another institution.
The 21st House in Vienna
The pavilion moved
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights and a happy end, the Pavilion of the Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels of 1958 received awards, was in Vienna for a museum, left empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture is passionate, the clear shapes, the crystal halls, the courageous curves and the new construction materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels universal exhibition is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
Construction is to date considered a contemporary architectural hole.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the pavilion of Austria in the following universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building placed in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was raised after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated, called the "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the suitable spaces and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is falling more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum was opened, which belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, a blow of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, art patinator on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founder director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and monuments protectors, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a library and a building of offices is also built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensitively reformed Joseph Olbrichs’ secession in Vienna, he expanded it and awarded him the contest, but not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a “important and immense place”, in which he contemplated “ almost every weekend” the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In current reforms there are big problems, the building was “a devorer of energy,” Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the crystal façade was changed, an insulating crystal reinforced with glass fiber was installed and the crystal roof was replaced by a special safety crystal.
The thermal bridges and steel bridges were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos were rehabilitated.
Two undergrounds were used for new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outdoor doors remain, the house is painted in ancient shades of caoba and protected from oxidation.
And the cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this with a strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked at the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and warns of a harsh soil in the underground.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "which wine from Brussels" has been difficult, said Krischanitz recently, a typical "casual appearance in the city's history."
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why it wanted “to awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been a hit of urban luck. The completely new and planned "central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another blow of luck: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another construction of Krischanitz, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporal art hall and, as it is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that rises to millions
The company has drawn up a crisis plan, which would prevent the train failures in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against the failures and delays of the trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent this year more than 70 million euros, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper “Bild”, invoking a group’s internal crisis plan, the investments scheduled until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For this, a better availability of the vehicles and the railway network should be achieved even with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 jobs to remove the snow from the roads and the andens.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice sands for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of errors and delays in the trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and the industry.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the federal railway office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently at the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axes at the central station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank is paying millions of dollars in the US.
After the tumult on President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, the Deutsche Bank has to pay there a million dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement, to put an end to the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA punishes many large banks to induce credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and pulled banks into the depths.
“We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to the courts,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which required a $20.5 million payment.
Debbie Matz, chairman of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA tries to reintegrate the lost millions originated.
Currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts to other major banks and in summer set lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of doubtful mortgage securities, they are the so-called securities supported by mortgages.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial entities.
In September 2008, at the point of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have set up countless processes to receive compensation or punish faults.
The Federal Agency for Housing Financing (FHFA) has produced the highest number of demands.
The 18 major international banks are concerned that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Also the Deutsche Bank has a demand from the FHFA, it is a business worth of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to “substantial losses,” without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debt as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, invests strongly in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technology since the long-term development forecasts of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his opinion about investing in the sector.
It had to be understood far before that IBM offers primarily services and seeks computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed at CNBC that it has acquired IBM shares for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has ascended with this to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the commitment.
He praised the direction that took care of the ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said about the strategy.
IBM has for some time established profitable Information Technologies services such as the operation of calculation centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for.
Buffett has avoided technology companies so far.
He said he only invested in companies whose he would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the opportunity in a commodity train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortiums such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffett, 81 years old, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Their lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His fast and infallible sense of earning money has given him the surname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock shares rose by one percent.
The blue giant, as known to IBM, has a stock value of more than $220 billion and is, together with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is concrete.
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubts the state of German law.
A newspaper talks about a “bloody ideology” that is reviving itself again.
The murders of eight small tricks and Greek entrepreneurs between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost that was thought dead long ago, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of extreme right-wing violence against Turks had occurred.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
“Does the bloody ideology revive again?”, the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk” titled the internet edition.
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the contrary, highlights that one of the murderers was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is worried why German authorities may be involved in the ultra-right pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensately, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil before the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was put on stage with joyful colors, like a story with a happy end.
The information came to some Turkish media as a bullet: "The German gift for the fifth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
"It begins to smell badly," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It highlights that the murderers were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the police behavior and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not searched for long before suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
Some are shown as less rhetorical as to the drastic media: "From now here it is lost, immigrants have nothing more than self-defense and weapons."
“This is the best self-protection.”
“German’s internal peace depends strongly on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network,” Selen writes.
This means that, if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks who live here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that uncertainty and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks aggravate the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past mistakes
In the Turkish press criticized then mainly the lack of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-shaped attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the Colony funeral.
It remains clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media again shows how deep it is, since then, the uncertainty of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, this time, frank words are needed.
The Bank of the Lake Scandal in Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went into bankruptcy in the financial crisis and since then slid from a crisis to the next.
It is now directed by a German.
Axel Weber did not think about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 it would start in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber pleases publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves kind observations about its future companions.
“USB has achieved a revitalization.”
“I am glad to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the bank’s security systems and defrauded €1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, the chief executive of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The chairman of the USB administration council has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber will be advising the bank from February 2012.
And it will take charge of the presidency of the administrative council in May, not early in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation necessary.
He is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just tested again that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently it was the world’s largest property administrator, and on the other hand, for years, it slides from a scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, is saved to the former so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also morning, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a great number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from adinerated customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s great banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent banking professor in Zurich for many years explains: "To my students, I have always qualified USB as a good bank model."
From the present point of view, one asks himself, “How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went out very bad on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the chief executive, who until then was considered a great and very intelligent bankier, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortise billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some would look with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opacous state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, given its wrong investments, the UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic values to the UBS for many billions, the Hellenic Confederation gave six billions of francs for an obligatoryly convertible bonus, through which it became the bank's coproprietary.
The whole Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic it was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland’s economic outcomes (see graph).
“We can’t rescue the UBS again,” said Geiger, a bank expert.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax conflict with America and showed its willingness to deliver the data of the adinerated customers, who possibly had deceived taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these with a paid compensation.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to have helped in tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative board.
and the output of the customers’ funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment banking through the wrong speculation and in the asset management through the aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was somewhat more quiet again, just when it was thought that the UBS was getting it again, this unrighteous story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded €1.7 billion, before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And it revealed, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“With the Adoboli case it is clear that the risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: “The UBS’s problem is that it doesn’t dominate risk controls.”
That’s why the idea of the precaution, with which Swiss bankers presented themselves for a long time, to be the guardians of the world’s greatest goods: no risk too big, instead, the security of the money wants to break the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unbeatable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Bahnhofstraße street in Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, embedded by the snow-covered heights of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are overwhelming, the rental are some of the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewellery like Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss such as the Sprüngli confitery.
The Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, passing through Credit Suisse's palace, to the elitary private banks like Julius Bär.
It enters the UBS reception room through a heavy rotating door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front there are large leather chairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a great letter to indicate the "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have moved the idea of the large Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank considers.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, it says, mainly in the investment bank, where the Anglo-Saxon have gained ground.
The Switzerland had nothing more to say.
“And they have been accustomed to the Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time.”
In fact, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
“These Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in its nation’s history,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “Der UBS-Crash” (“The UBS crash” in Spanish).
The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How does it happen to them?
We talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two different UBS precursors to complement themselves: a rich but sleeping bank with the property management center in Zurich and a poor but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived timely with a lot of money, with which they could run a great financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to open the way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
“It’s a tragic case.”
It is tragic,.
It is clear: the disaster arrived before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the world’s most powerful investment bank.
They covered the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well.
In currency transactions and in stock trading was at the highest.
However, corporate counselors in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has emptiness in American mortgage products.
To fill these emptiness, UBS started an adventure that almost costs her existence.
Avid growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It turned into a powerful machine to own American mortgage credits and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own account.
And also, as other banks sought down for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a bank expert.
So great is the euforia, so deep is the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order was more complicated than they expected.
Positions at the UBS have become projectable seats and are insecure so far.
Nowadays, whoever manages a big bank, has a job almost impossible.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to investment banking, focus on property management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go so far (now).
But the investment banking needs to decrease considerably, it is clear now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought in the Italian-Swiss 51 years as a transitional solution, as the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently run the UBS business, the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to his state in the mid-1990s.
It has 3,500 seats.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking right now.
Until now, he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
the next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burns over the U.S. stock exchange
The imminent recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors in the beginning of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remains in force.
Braking industrial production on the continent squeezes the hopes of stabilizing in its origin a crisis caused by debt.
It could not impose general relief on the government changes in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems are going back to a front-end, said Janney Montgomery Scott's Mark Luschini.
First of all, the financial assets are listed on the sales list.

Europe cannot get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precautions, it is not yet clear if Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, from your point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.

Intelligent grades spread across cities
In many places the grays are considered "problematic paths": these intelligent animals are not expelled from the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grays belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are accumulated for the harshness and the noise of the animals.
Although there has not been any means against the “problematic sheep” so far.
The grays no longer come out of the cities, experts say in the first symposium on grays in Read, Eastern Frisia.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the field migration of certain protected grains; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end with traditional vital spaces.
The hunt, the growing building and the fall of trees that host them make the life of the birds difficult.
The grains are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 reproductive couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district's grays jumped to the negative press holders.
Critics have qualified the hunting of animals by means of bird traps and the murder with palm as especially brutal.
“Expulsing them and evading them in a normal way, nothing is achieved,” said Werner Klöver, urbanist and landscapeist at Leer.
Disparing with water to the nodes or throwing the trees are often unwanted consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert at Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals are divided, the large colonies are divided and distributed elsewhere.”
Removing them only is imaginable as an exception in hospitals, elderly residences or colleges.
“We have to live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
It is possible a combination of evading animals from sensitive residential areas and cabbage so that they can sit again elsewhere.
Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist, makes advertising against so that animals are treated in a completely different way: “The best thing is that we can endure a peak on the face with an aplome.”
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on the grades of Ascheberger, where writers inform about the life of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion about the criticism of bird noise: "Everything is forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grays not only take advantage of the resources to access shadows, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge checked in four degrees how far the bird intelligence reaches.
In a experiment, the birds quickly learned that they should let a stone fall on a platform to thus reach a poll larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape that the stone should have to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the astute grays had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a poll larva on a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their hole with the peak.
But the researchers left them a piece of alambre.
With which the four animals formed a hang, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four grays succeeded in the first attempt.

Jiracek arrived in the Czech Republic
Then, Ergolding's Wolfgang Stark college was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the penati area of Bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing to the ground (36.).

After the break, the 2004 European champion clarified everything with 4 goals.

In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a beginning of dream.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance drop, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not send the ball inside the port.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made place to Ivan Perisic, from Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern of Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni to go to the Eurocopa

Konstantin Vassilyev (57) empathed with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23nd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first great opportunity.

Massacre at a personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The Beauty and the Sorrow: A intimate story about the First World War, "begins with a long dramatic persone of the guy that can make a man falls his soul to his feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and turn it into your page brand.
You’ll get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelist narration, and this dramatic persone will function as your GPS, a phare during those few moments in which, as one of your men and women, you’re confused and disappointed in the cloud of the war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is a rare book, which describes, accurately, as "a work of anti-history".
It contains some notable names, important treatments or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.”
"The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle" combines the experiences in war times of more or less 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from college and botanics to escalers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, become crazy or die.
Their lives flourish here as votive candles burned in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund’s book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that the First World War was only the funeral trincher war on the western front.
"The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall above the columns; one passes Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the ce-tse mosquitoes are an intrusive problem.
This is a great book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stumbles.
When the fire of artillery is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Anyway, who is coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why this war has to be fought.
“The lack of facts,” says Mr. Englund, “is filled with conjections, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"The Beauty and the Pain of the Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German marine of the high sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in his majority of memories, letters and other material already published earlier.
The explanations of their lives can be terrifying or confusing, but they are more life-filled in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and to fix them with what is there.
About telling the story of a German college says: "Sucedate us, everywhere Sucedate."
“Coffee, false aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons.”
He continues to talk about the successive food in Germany.
It describes “meat made from cooked rice and printed in meat fat (and removed with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made of roots and peelings of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soils.”
There are, observes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in salchichas production, 511 coffee substitutes registered."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American acknowledges his own impulse towards wildlife and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best-seller, and pretending that that barbecue means civilization and that there is no barbar behind that strawbery and strawbery."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
“When one resigns to the thought of sacrificing himself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it’s horribly like “a condemned being strangulated in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has become more and more an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the young century bestiar: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass killer with good clothes that performs his carnicery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both unbeatable and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who tried actively to catch a Venerean prostitutes disease as a way to escape the service on the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen as the gonococcus pus trade, which soldiers buy and embodiment with it their genitals in the hope of ending in the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate throw it over their eyes, which often gives rise to a lifetime blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war to “desatated exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels like Without Novel on the Front of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume connects to a unconventional panteon.
His book has one of the most devastating ends I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I will not reveal it.
But it’s like he had come from his book, scratched from your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a pen.
After a false step in advance, a minute-planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying anti-storm helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept in secret for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence emphasized how the operation plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the pulverization of pepper spray on the protesters, infringing the department's rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas".
And therefore the police operation to clean out the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared to see how occupations had evolved in other cities.
A major disaster simulacre was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye looking towards Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called disorder training – counter-terrorist measures that implicated rapid mobilization of a large number of police officers – to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the East River side of Manhattan.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as “a exercise.”
"To the few police I know that they were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter the Zuccotti park," the person said, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to clean up the park, but resigned when hundreds of protesters arose early after they heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents from several police units, including special forces from all over the municipal district – dozens of mobile agents who usually flooded the high-rise districts of crime.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
“It was appropriate to do it when there was the smallest number of people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with focuses and speakers gathered on the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before they left.
The lights and preached messages that came back from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their clear blue curtains, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving time to the protesters to pick up their property.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if it was necessary to make detentions in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said it was attempted to prevent them from seeing the police in action in the park, and that they had been treated suddenly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said the mobile TV units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, could capture images.
As the police moved to the west through the dense marble of the protesters’ personal effects, including baggage and baggage of paper and plastic waste packed with clothes, cleaning department teams followed them, gathering what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp fell among them by their arms.
And two people wrapped into trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the candads.
No arrests were made in the park until more or less 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were because of "change of public order and resistance to authorities," he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the superior officer uniformed in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, “was not directing the operations,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between the streets Liberty and Cedar, if they had to enter.
They raised barricades on the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti park.
At a given time, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people outside.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the noiseest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestant jumped over the capo of a police car, and others were seen taking the air out of the wheels of a police furgonette.
At a given time, a piece of counterchaped came out flying from the crowd.
At the end, an agent and a protestant were hospitalized.
Support workers will demand the city for dismissals
The syndicate representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to demand the city on Wednesday, alleging that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on the schools that care for poor students.
The claim is, possibly, the last weapon at the disposal of the trade union, the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their job on October 7, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, the city’s access to a health care fund in charge of working groups to close their budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
In an audience in the City Council last month, the educational counselor, Dennis M. Walcott, said that dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A council member counterattacked and told him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be dismissed.
Municipal District 37 officials said they submitted the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be demanded. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official submission of the complaint, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as accused, and has eight workers dismissed as prosecutors, all of them black or Latin women, just like the majority of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the claim and therefore could not make comments on its specific allegations.
According to a claim deletion obtained by The New York Times, the syndicate has focused on the number of dismissals in the schools in the poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that the poor schools lost more attendants, since they had been insufficiently subsidized in a chronic manner.
Although there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in District 8 and 9 in the South of the Bronx.
Given the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of adinerated parents who can collect funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.D. District 36 budget decreased by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The syndicate also claims that high school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum that authorizes the parental coordinators' dismissal.
The memorandum used the word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school salary to a job stock, whose salary is paid by the central office.
"Six-six parents coordinators were dismissed," says the complaint launcher, "and not only in excess."
Mission Completed, Congress Ready to Achieve Agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the rise in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion had success, that the veteran dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi had been captured and murdered, and the U.S. participation came to its end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (democrat of Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent of Connecticut), praising the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "valence".
“This resolution is to honour the courageous of Libya, starting to reconstruct their country,” Kerry said.
“It’s an affirmation of bipartistic support for its democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, the lawmakers of both parties fought with each other and with the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that authorizes the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came to vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the Chamber, the Chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress as annoying enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not as angry as to actually seat the grass under his feet.
After that, Congress’ indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell in the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was murdered on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “happy the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves” and “happy the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also "decloses the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition towards democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure gain the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide the legislators as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the chief Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressists and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic that actually a vote of the entire assembly in the Chamber or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far to make their amendments come to the assembly, but not because of lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicated – the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate – and others with slight variations each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment only in the Chamber, and another handful that will "control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors – especially new republicans seeking to refinate their currículums – the opportunity to assert that they were the “authors” of such measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was approved in August, required both the Chamber and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that Congress members can fulfill, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat of New York) wants to remove the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (democrated by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment that prohibits homosexual marriages is a perpetual proposal, as well as one that prohibits flag burning.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that members have been when proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they did not have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Golden but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him to fire in a constituent act in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrated by Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing accompanied by Broadway's melody "The Sun Will Come Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fracturated his chest and perforated the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the Chamber to issue his triumphant vote in the debt roof agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficile".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, “But well.”
The interview with Giffords and his husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special program, which was released on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head swallowed and a long scratch crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers lifted, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting on a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A movement of head.
A friction of the lips.
And then, his first word: “What.”
In a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "tostada", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: You see the congressist singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn’t remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to question for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is arrested in a prison in Missouri and is being treated by force while waiting for trial.
“Many people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
“Hard, hard and hard.”
Kelly told Sawyer that at a moment of her wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
“So, I said, ‘Gabby, you have not been defeated,’” Kelly said.
“You have only been hit.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to return with more strength than ever.”
People feel more sad than respect.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for the homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, seafarers, aviators and seafarers flooded in their positions around it.
The crowd of labels stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring funding.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Mayor, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They showed them like a kind of orphan boy,” the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it was not respect, it was really sorry.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has captured the military and a often distant, sometimes adorer American public.
He praised the troops with praises for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if uniformed people are guilty.
“We’re not victims at all,” Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland said, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to put ourselves in the role of untouched souls."
The topic is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who don’t want to look unpleasant or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger to which the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War faced was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about sorrow are conducted in silence and in private between war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would be wondering if there would be "an angry and violent veteran under the surface," Cancian said, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtilly asked him if he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding job from Washington immediately after his fighting tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to cope with the negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from U.S. indifference towards wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in the Second World War,” said retired general tenant David Barno, who commanded the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a service member.
The troops are recognized by the number of turns they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or the scope of their injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure to end the rape
This week, a historic audience will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity before the rape.
If not, hundreds of prosecutors are preparing for the next.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a companion.
It was October 2008 and he was headed back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague who was carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room to drink a cup.
“It sounded a alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the native of Texas left his concern.
I thought, no, it was 19.
“It’s from Texas,” he says.
“I wish I had heard my instincts.”
A few minutes after entering Lyman's room, the man approached him behind, throwing her down and raping her, he says.
This week, November 18, Lyman and other 27 members of current and former military personnel are looking forward to a judicial decision in a historic trial that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have interposed against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce the widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 prosecutors, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claim that they were raped or sexually agred by their comrades, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or give adequate justice after the alleged aggression.
Burke says he goes to the major plan of the army, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a structure from up to down,” he says.
“Who are the people who are able to eradicate the culture of repressions?
Burke also says that since February, more than 400 survivors have been contacted with her, many of whom could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to say, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy – in essence, that the military cannot be prosecuted by current or old soldiers for the injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court judgment called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damages suffered by the staff in active service.
“The alleged damages are part of the military service of the prosecutors,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in battle, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time for the army to be modernised, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are ongoing, in addition to her.
At the Yale Faculty of Law, the Veteran Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting a misogenous environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the diagnoses of “personality disorder” assigned to the victims of rape in order to give them the high of service – a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it manages benefits claims for people who say they have been sexually agred in the service.
Nine draft laws have been submitted separately in Congress by a bipartistic mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual aggression, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the aggression is notably underlying, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which is approximately 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examine the processing rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the army went to trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The prosecutors in the Burke case, describe his attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, he denounced the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after that occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a kit of rape, and her aggressor's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally absent.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
“I thought I was going to go to work – I found myself screaming from the room.”
“I was placed in the psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember I told my command officer, ‘This was not your judgment, this was my judgment.’
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her not suitable for service.
In January 2010 she was dismissed from the service under less-that-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As for whether the case submitted by Lyman and his counterparts continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington Faculty of Law.
However, she points out, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What is interposed between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres doctrine.
The army has been behind for decades because it has not the same incentive and dissuasion that it raises responsibility.
And he adds: “The chances are strongly against them... but it’s important for them to try it.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing fails to go on its way, Burke, the lawyer of the prosecutors, will put on his other hundreds of prosecutors for future cases.
“We will continue fighting the army on this issue until the reform occurs,” he says.
“Of until we die, what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a killing in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from being alone in the cyberspace: He had spent most of the time he preceded his attack in front of his computer, talking with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy this summer, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't so difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British study center DEMOS.
Facebook’s personal information alloy is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy – the way that sellers have been using for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing groups fans across Europe and then they directed them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that questioned about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
By reaching through Facebook, Bartlett and colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 extreme-right matches in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
“It’s a completely new way to do a research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not surprising at all: The right-wing online supporters tend to be young, men, and angry with immigration.
However, in a kind of turn, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
The work of DEMOS is just an example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "Like", messages on the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a rise in research, pushing the number of academic jobs with the site’s name on the title to a 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study the people you could not approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the match, and they would never allow you access," says Bartlett.
“Facebook removes all that – go to them directly.”
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues, found that university students who talked about their drunk on Facebook had a significantly greater risk of having drunk problems than students who remained silent about the topic.
Moreno suggests that colleagues of students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many state updates with their wipes.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Institute of Child Research, said the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “pinching” its own population to obtain data.
The Data Team of the site has elaborated statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness Index (principally using the information to which you can access - digital freedom defenders long ago who argue that the site should put at the disposal of others their large amounts of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play the Scrabble with a friend thousands of kilometers away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users go into a survey they don’t even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think many users have even thought that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, on a 2006 study he carried out with the public Facebook walls of students.
“In what concerned them, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even off-line, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know what part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his years as a technological researcher, Selwyn believes that a subject paper and a bulgary are still the best research tools that no one can use.
“There’s no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens out of line."
“Free and unhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance at the Oslo court.
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in a room full of 500 people.
“I oppose the court, since it received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I recognize the facts but I don’t declare myself guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for expressing his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik under custody for 12 weeks more, prohibited access to the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have a strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and family members of the victims attended the audience.
Some came with the hope to look at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he is hidden under the key.
Everyone came forward to the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and unhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark costume and blue corbata, Breivik kept calm and professional throughout the audience and looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange notion of being part of a major “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he was not a mental sick, and said there was no evidence that he would act with complices.
It is possible for some to console that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically soften the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," a family member of a victim said.
“It would be much easier if it seemed.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, Show in a Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the technology genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that has been overwhelmed as the advance of a series of special projections on the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the commercial processes and product workflows.
He was undoubtedly a designer, dreamer and self-known hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flow diagrams – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The triumph of the idiots) on the personal computer wings, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time they had passed a few years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensely in his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely’s interview was used in Nerds, he said the original of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full copy of VHS was discovered in the director’s garage.
This file material, slightly re-edited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost 68-minute interview, which comes to the Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate interviews in depth, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silence between the questions and the answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly sweeping his thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster towards the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do well and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computer science.
One thing is to read posthumous Jobs’ career reviews, but there’s something raw and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, the dreamer anxious at the edge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining it all in detail here, it was and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of The Lost Interview:
How to Learn to Lead a Business:
“Thro the years in business, I always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers that give you invariably are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That’s what I found.
Jobs brings in detail his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Disconcerted by the way in which the costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was made to the eye of good cover, and then adjusted with a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that assured that they could determine the commercial costs in detail.
The jokes of the Pope:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box" he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euforia here when describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT & T network to another, while creating a bulk with the greatest number of satellites possible.
“We were surrounding things around the world about half a dozen times and you screamed through the public telephone and returned a minute later to the public telephone at the side door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We two, we didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would never have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box at midnight and asking to talk to the Pope, while he was doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in midnight to talk to the U.S. diplomat, the two exploded in carcasses just before the Pope himself was awake to go to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, on the hunt of spare parts to build a frequency counter, he sought Bill Hewlett in the phone guide and made him a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees."
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, I had a small catodic tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and would waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
Improvisation of innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he dedicated himself to selling a handful of base plates, he asked a customer if he could mount the whole team.
Working with only 30 credit days, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, as he was in Apple, he remembers the struggles he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments... I was screaming that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I hardened and went out and found a designer.
90 days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was completely reliable.
About the big companies losing strength:
Much before he was the leader of Apple’s Renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in his vision, and would lose control of his market share.
“Say that you work on IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopies and printers, and what?”
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so this kind of people end up leading companies and the people responsible for the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to that position of monopoly is pudded because of people who don’t have the notion of good products vs bad products – the knowledge of the necessary profession.
That’s what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could have become part of the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s.
They took the defeat of victory.
Innovation as an artistic expression:
“There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtles of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do – some things you can’t do to make the electrons, the glass makes them, the robots make them, the factories make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain – these concepts – to adjust them all at the same time.
At the end everything is reduced to the taste - it falls down to try to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to which you are doing.
Picasso said the good artists copy, the great artists steal.
We’ve never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who accidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, you might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with health care law rivals while the court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court gathered at a closed door to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were praised at a dinner sponsored by the lawyer signature that will disclose the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit submitted by 26 states challenging the total reform of health care approved by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists throughout the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic allegation of 5 and a half hours is expected for March, and the result will probably further disturbs the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full appeal at the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law should be rejected will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. general prosecutor during George W. Bush's government.
Clement’s lawyer signature, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated for many years to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the result of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the assistants was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This is not in conflict with ethical rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: "A judge can attend events to gather funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honor guest, or figure in the program of such event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the lawyer buffets in the case, as well as to a company with an enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethical activists in the government.
"This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges who acts the court for the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were scattered in a gala funding with lawyers who have pending cases before the court."
Their appearance and assistance in the collection of funds for this event undermines any demands of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticism they say that they too easily mix the court’s activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives argue that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the general prosecutor of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the first instance court.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to abstain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as to now being impartial.
Kagan has not given any indications that he will do so.
Boeing receives $18 billion record order
The Emirates airline asks for 50 double-passenger aircraft Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, a transaction worth more than a billion dollars.
Rarely it is news when a company receives a order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big transaction when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft rises to a record of $18 billion.
It is as big as the place from which Boeing received the order: Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years the airlines in the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its biggest order in history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double-call jet.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show in 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which presumes fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sales price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
“The quality of these customers in particular is very strong.”
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only have the money to pay the aircraft, but a rise in fuel prices – usually harmful for airlines, because it’s one of the highest costs – is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the rise in oil prices.
This is important because they have less chances than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices increase, Dihora said.
“They have a natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the broad fighter aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the air fair occurs four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more impulses after customers demanded an increase in useful load and range.
The shares of Boeing Co rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister, apparently defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón says the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calderón's sister seems to have lost her candidacy to governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped to incline the race in favour of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the forefront in the western state governor race to Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of the organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday’s vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They took over the urns, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote” in favour of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI has the hope to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have overcome for little margin Calderón, who had led the surveys before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently occupies the position of governor, was in third place, a big defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cards specializing in marijuana, heroin and methanfetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against the traffickers in December 2006.
But violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was murdered a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the Michoacán elections appear, a victory will help to boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of the next year."
The BAsD calls on Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, Chief Executive Officer of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said the two largest fastest-growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe in a "imparcial" way and said that Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
“We are all together in this.”
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European Monetary Union has been seriously affected by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s debt costs have been dangerously shining and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised the fears that it could push the world economy to recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered a greater negotiating power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from the decline of exports and the exhaust of foreign capital entries.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to help the rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the billion twenty thousand people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about 2 dollars a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beach and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers on jobs from poorly managed companies, and losses generating such as railways.
Mr. Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens with "important chain effects" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the “risk to the bottom” due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingent plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital leaks from their economies.
Pentagon warns about possible defence cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts that are coming could undermine national security and cause a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battle camps, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digering the $450 billion reductions throughout the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more reductions that can be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on the expenditure.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress' failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "secuestro", would lead to a 23 percent global reductions and a high to many new projects.
"A so large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects unable to be executed - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to dismiss many of our civil officials involuntaryly and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the goal."
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good will.”
Cuts over time would reach combat troops, Panetta said.
"Al the funding for war times in the accounts of Ultramarine Contingency Operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disorders in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
“The hiring of staff would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war.”
“The wage staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in war times, and legal and political support would be interrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
“The consequence of a kidnapping at the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published the Panetta letter.
“This is not a result with which we can live, and it is not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the interests of U.S. national security, and it should not be allowed to occur.”
If Panetta's letter and senators' recent warnings will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify the calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts is to see.
Panetta has been more and more frankly about possible cuts, although she came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets at Congress and the White House and knowing that she faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a dark landscape of what could be in front - an army with a coat, but not a core.
“It’s a ship without sailors.”
“It’s a brigade without bullets.”
“It’s an air wing without enough trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of quarters, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that suffers from low morality, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with the potential opponents.”
“In fact, he invites to aggression...”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta explains new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: it delays in the time of response to crises, conflicts and disasters; it severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed in advance throughout the world; and it constitutes an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the hache, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bombardment, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal fighter vessel and the new ground fighter vehicle that the Army and the Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional tests of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over the course of 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and face the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the latest titles indicates how serious and omnipresent deceit and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The administrators of the Pennsylvania State University have been accused of perjury for allegedly hiding reports that said a retired football coach was sexually offending children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “pilled” with an open microphone saying to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsion countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his denials quickly rejected by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infringements in the funding of the campaign related to the coverage of an extramatrimonial relationship.
And, again, no one who would live it will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has dismissed by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The legends about the trap in school and university exams are very widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the exam answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any day, studies show that they can lie anywhere 10 to 200 times.
That is sure, many of those lies are piadous lies.
Another study showed that the strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or “location of lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclam: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that have carried out deep research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that old myths about lies have been rejected.
The liars look in their eyes.
They don’t always tortue, balbucean, ruborize or worry.
It cannot be concluded either that liars are difficult to detect or unmasker.
An trained lies detector can get to the truth learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, the formation of questions and the times.
I spent several years surveying scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate through our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel pleasant, managing their own emotions and feeling intuitively how others perceive them.
We know by research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more “self-oriented lies”, while women say more “one-oriented lies” – usually to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less frequently to their partners than non-married people (but the lies they usually say tend to be “enormous”).
We also know that if you are perceived as a malicious, others will feel less guilty by lying to you.
How do I know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called “create a base line.”
It helps to provide reference points to then measure changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter and vocal characteristics.
It’s better to know if someone normally strikes with his foot all the time to not make unfair accusations when he sees his feet strikes in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceitful, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signals, not as proof of deception.
People who deceive can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, incline towards a exit, change their posture significantly or show a “post-interview dishogo” -- that exaggerated breath of relief and posture change once all the difficult questions have ended.
Often interrogators make false to see that the interview has ended only to look for that post-interview relief.
It also focuses on the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put his foot to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a national search for her.
People who deceive can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman...Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of “restrictive language” when he answers a difficult question: “Well... to say truth... to what I... to my understanding.”
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magical formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover deceit is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil pipeline plan dismissed after the threat of U.S. delay in its approval
Days after Obama’s administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — angrying the trade unions while calming the ecologists — the company that seeks to build the oil pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it will move the planned oil pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada’s chief executive, Alex Pourbax, says the companyins confidence that over time the oil pipeline will be approved, although it’s true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay the decision for a federal permission for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast subterranean water supply.
“This is a true way of progress,” Nebraska Republican representative Lee Terry told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to separate any decision until 2013, after the next year’s elections, although officials denied that the policy was included in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed all his support.
The 1,700-kilometre oil pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day from the Alberta province to the refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the ecologists, but loved by the working groups, who have bet for the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to oil pipeline.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska opposed to the plan are suppressing the legislation to force a removal from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquiferry, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s general inspector has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a signature that was hired to lead the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of provoking a child vomiting from fear
A New York family claims that the disc music diva, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy in the vesty of her Manhattan building, landing her little daughter to the point that she vomited from fear.
"Lady Marmalade's diatriba scared Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family said at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was the 10th November of last year when the tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a childhood garden teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk drove down to the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Somebody approached behind and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to catch her," she said.
LaBelle demonstrated angry the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "He shouldn't have left his daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘I’m not interested in what you say or think.’
He was angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J in a loud voice...
I had a bottle of water and started throwing the water from the bottle on me.”
He said Genevieve was hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you’ve done to my daughter,’ the girl’s mother said.
LaBelle flattered over her mother—who was still subject to Genevieve—and had to be contained by her surroundings and withdrawn to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so strongly that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but did not get a response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unidentified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it can get to a support association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his behavior,” Davis said.
"This type of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed to a childhood garden teacher who takes in the arms a 18-month-old child."
Climate Adversity Breaks the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and the economy was contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, autodenominated of change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth observed, instead there is a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the ICE report, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damages occurred in 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21,07 percent had partial damage, the main sinistrated crops were those of vegetables, corn and garbage.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate passed to be 5.28 per cent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that in number of people throws to more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase relative to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that from the public policy have been carried out.
"What is being seen is an unemployment growth that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a resource restriction by the legislation that was approved at the congress to fight money laundering, and for people who catch dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something," he said.
Migration Arrested
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering already have also many difficulties to find work, that people are staying and is demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise,” he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloense labour market is worse by considering the high level of informality that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the occupied population in the state works without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
Together with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor payments are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contracts of IED
Together with the decline of economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decline of Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the state IED summed $630 thousand 697 which represents a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the $5 million 143 thousand 312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
The Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos in the year, occurring mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In front of the economic contraction scenario, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the purpose of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a amount of 2 billion 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, expressed that during 2011 he was lacking the harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the government of the state.
“The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of all and above all the good march already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic Lentitude
Loredo López said events like ice cream in early year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is a product of several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn’t turn back quickly enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we’re closing very below the expectations we had,” he said.
redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said it is necessary to cause the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The president of the Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better covers the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different matters, in the field of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown advances in its way of conducting public policy.
“There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to do,” he said.
He was sentenced to 8 kg of mariguana.
Five years in prison and 100 days in fine, a neighbor of Navolato was sentenced for possession of eight kilograms of mariguana.
The General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic that the narcomenudist sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of mariguana for trade purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army elements on June 7, 2010 in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narkoman was circulating in a pick-up, white-colored truck, where he was carrying a black-colored bag in the vehicle’s box and in the copilot’s seat a small bag, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured was at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced continues internally at the Center for the Execution of the Crime's Legal Consequences.
Required contributions for works
Social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being concluded or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of Social Development municipal indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced, they are at risk by not having fulfilled the Government of the State with the contributions that correspond to it which add a resource above the 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is of 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these is made in force.
“They’re almost 12 million what they’ve got to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when from July they had to give us a part,” he said, “we have started the works and they’re very advanced, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
“It has already happened in the previous six years because the State didn’t have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we to be able to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the State left out,” he said.
Despite the commitment of state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the management so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
“They’re almost 12 million what they’ve got to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have not given us a fifth.”
Court validates "analog apagon" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Deputies interpelled against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog shutdown" from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight necessary votes to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed in his attributions by issuing the decree that detailed the actions to follow to concretize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed because it did not reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to make a statement on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and of law reservation.
For the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admiting the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and of all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers decided to dismiss also the demand proposed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his intervention, the president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also consider that if I did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the Federal Executive, who has by constitutional mandate, the State rectorate.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
It would be to delay the benefits of digitalization, which implies a decision of public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he said, "seek the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorate of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and has done it through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in some way invades the sphere of competences of the Congress, since it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he said.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" counting in Michoacán
According to the data drawn by the PREP the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is just 27 percent, yet without accounting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of the electoral process of this year in Michoacán, where according to the data thrown by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the election of governor is just 27 percent, yet without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of linearities in order to harmonize local standards with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As it will be remembered, Michoacán did not approve his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of the State or his Electoral Justice Act, since the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before concluding the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the deadlines provided for in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the 9th of November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state mandate to the constitutional reforms, since it has no right to "sanction them or vet them."
Interviewed around the possibility of the "vot by vote", Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal explains that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM will be possible the realization of partial and total countings of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given in the cases that: the results of the acts do not coincide; there is no scrutiny and computing act in the file of the box or does not operate in power of the president of the box; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations of the acts.
Furthermore, the total count of the vote received in all the fields of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winner of the election and the second place in the vote is equal or lower to a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that postponed the second of the indicated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the presumably winning candidate and the second place is equal or lower to a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of partial count shall be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in that situation it is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and the second place is just 0.16 per cent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.

Three men were found murdered at bullets in different parts of the body and with grace shooting, in an abandoned finca of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

The new Italian government will form on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country at the edge of the economic disaster.
The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy at the edge of the economic disaster and threatened the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrates, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the result of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
“The frame is now well delineated,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard austerity package required by European leaders to recover the hit confidence in Italy.
Strengthening the pressure on Monti to rush, the unstability of the markets placed the performance of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian patronal Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were prompted considerably by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are intended to have a good outcome,” Central Right party secretary Angelino Alfano told the press.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the Technokratic Government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti Government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in your efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief breath at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of the Italian debt have now returned to critical levels among the uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti said his government should last until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before anticipating the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that he should be formed only by technicians, an indication of his repairs before a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual confidence and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rise of the Spanish is higher than the rise of the tics.
Of the 22 footballers named from Spain, ten repay the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 convoked arrived at the 50 matches.
A major contrast to the Costa Rica, if compared the 22 called by both countries for the friendly today, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA’s monthly ranking, account for a wide record of class A inter-selection games, the Tricolor only owns Defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has the 50 international matches.
This figure reached it on Friday before in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in powerful Premier League clubs in England, maintain an intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as the Champions League.
It is added to the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of the Eurocopa and the Football World Cup.
Ticos footballers, on the contrary, possess a limited international stream in a zone, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is of the archer Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equated the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international encounters.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the brain driver of Barcelona, possesses 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by the UEFA along with the other centuries of the Iberic team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ariet, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The Less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain figure Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not approaching the 20th.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still don’t debut.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-year celebration tour
“To go to Costa Rica is a dream made reality.”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts on Sunday, at the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also become reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its two-year celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the band Angelina The X and the nationalists of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcription is on The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican followers, it’s a dream made reality that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made reality for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I’ve been in Costa Rica only once and for holidays; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to stay there a few days.
So it is exciting to bring our music there.
I wonder why there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we regret that it took us so much time to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; so it was how we learned, through people who love surfing.
When watching the tour, they have come delivering enormous shows with many songs.
What are you planning for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we’ve never touched there before, then we don’t have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this due to?
I think it’s partially because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we take a while not to play, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting to people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes and absolutely.
First of all, I think no one of us imagined we would be in a big rock band and having done it for more than 20 years has made it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and it excites us so much that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it’s something uncommon.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it’s far more strange when five or ten bands come out from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his tour, so we are lucky to be friends of all of them yet and we are honored to be part of that sound from Seattle that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like you stay united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and second, we are all worried about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, also opened musical avenues that give everyone freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and could not be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t be too turning because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as one reminds that people are there for music, that reminds you that you must respect music and what brought it, without becoming famous and a rock star, something that no one of us really interests.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was something great at the beginning.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released a album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it would last so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the letter of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he feels.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
They are so many.
In the first ones I think are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all the afternoon about the basists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that emerged at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the cause of this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem more lightweight, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them to me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there is some trauma in your life and a family or a friend is lost, those things begin to influence your art and your music and those two songs, undoubtedly, represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.

Fujimori is interned again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was interned on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength that it presents in the legs, his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including a cancer in the tongue by which he has been operated four times and remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and the loss of strength of his lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of indulgence for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he is known innocent.
He was operated four times of cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 pounds to which other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs have been associated.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people in the hands of an annihilation squadron of the army that operated clandestinely in the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with her Mexican couple, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collectivity of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "a property for the exchange of information in all the political matters between the two nations," the South American Presidency said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get that Calderon supports Uruguay in the incident with France arising when French president Nicolas Sarkozy included the country in a list of tax paradises, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax paradise, a statement that caused Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult with his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico presides since November the G20, group integrated by the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has in force with the South American country, since January of this year, a agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The government has tried in recent years to speed up the concreation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that have not implemented all international standards of tax cooperation.
In the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The bigotudo fontanero passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, untouchable, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the wrath of the evil Bowser, but never so far had it done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will struggle for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work,” Nintendo’s Spanish specialized press manager Omar Álvarez said during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally thought for that support" since so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has claimed that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "sensitive" to engage the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succeed to optical illusions".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also involves the character's turn to a portable console, which was not produced since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes guests to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous deliveries, consisting that the bigot fountain will have to go through mined platforms of dangers with the aim of releasing the princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelty in the movements, the environments, the costumes and the enemies and also to a "jugable" Luigi.
Colom advocates Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he gave trial to the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy for the $70 million washing.
This ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom said his decision obeyed the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a judgment court had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his mandate "he didn't put his hands" in judicial resolutions and gave tramway to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, they will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Walls, both for narcotraffic.
Colom's decision is an executive trial after all judicial and constitutional instances are exhausted to prosecute the ex-mandatar from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has solvented his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was abolished by the Q120 million discharge in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people in risk
The entity was born to prevent the decline in the margin of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of the century.
It adds the hundred-long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make balance at an event held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, unemployed, with dogradication problems or in a situation of falling into marginality.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of responsible entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unit character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the exconseller of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the extent of mayor and current ecosocialist council, Ricard Gomà, attended the event.
They also went to the large room of the Fabra i Coats the current conseller of Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president put Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight the bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
An occupied finca where macrofiests were made
The invaders had owned 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the finca on Wednesday afternoon without offering resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51st Street of Balmes lived has come to its end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macrofiests that desperate the neighborhood, by judicial order and without the need for a police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From now there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The okupas, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building – the rest are inhabited – took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the stage of the multitudinary holidays, which lasted up to two days and desperate the rents.
Near the building is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the discoteca points out that the invaders of the finca made him unfair competition, as they sold the cups for three euros, while in the discoteca they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure site had to respond to neighborhood complaints for noise, while, according to it, the discomforts are not provoked by the customers of the discoteca, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendants to the holidays that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the discoteca explained that the discomforts were so large that it even reached an agreement with the property owner and nine months ago that it "forgives" the rental.
The City Guard also confirmed that during the last few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors for the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to dissolve the real estate immediately to end the problems of coexistence and civism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last months the okupas had gone entering all the floor of the building and almost all the floors, and that some have even been stolen.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be contundent against the incivism that has been generated in the finca."
Also yesterday, the Mossos displaced a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m. the police headed to the 35th of the street of Mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people accessed the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide with the opportunity of the call beyond controversy on fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopen the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the midst of the 80s, in full upcoming of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a few promotional passages of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park again situated itself, in the imaginary of many, as the upper boundary of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (mar).
The rating of Collserola as a natural park rounded in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalys in the role of the bear Yogi.
In these it was until, in September, the municipality called a megacompetiation composed of 16 competitions for other so many doors of access to Collserola.
A door reminds the idea of the park, without a doubt.
Or that or someone intends to put the doors to the field.
The question comes alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its merely organizational vessel and for what it implies of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation between all the Barcelona architects.
It’s almost a recurrent topic to take hand when two members of this ancient cast of elected recognize themselves on an elevator.
And this fact gives foot, justly, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university teachers, have presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it makes it necessary" to debate on "the mountain front", since the discourse of Ildefons Cerdà, the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
This is because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect sentence for whom the title of "Collserola doors" encompasses a "legical trap": there is no need to think about them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where it is to act."
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, quotes the proposal of "intellectual right" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the “incident that is today projecting the public space” after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum “his singing of the cisne”.
The first fear is the own delimitation of some borders on where it can be built.
“Limiting something is fixing the next step,” that is, its overpass.
“We need to think about new urban, planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can give foot to authentic disasters.”
More stunned to the question, Mòdol opens that, simplifying, the Collserola valleys "can be understood as a park, the Barcelona, no", for a merely topographic question.
Mòdol reminds that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "there should not fall into broken bag", although he thanks the opportunity that the municipality offers to his grief to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the self-conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "dubbs" about whether this technical profile is the one that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all one right," pointed out) that have had to be created: "The architects should be just a tool."
Bayona insists that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a global view of Collserola: "16 transversal competitions have been called - says - in the mountain-mar sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, that see and understand the area as a whole."
This causes, at least in your case, that you have opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the door architect on the side.
In his opinion, that yes, the municipality should ensure that the immediate range above the Dalt Ronde should provide, in all its extension, a area of equipment that would make a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of row, Casino Red's legal captain granted forgiveness to Monterrey's mayor's brother of the process that was followed by alleged chantage.
After staying in prison for 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after Casino Red's legal supporter granted forgiveness to the District Second Criminal Court, which follows a chantage process against Monterrey's mayor's brother.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded him the payment of an economic quota so that the regional council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal process against the brother of the panist mayor and on September 2 was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the state.
In that place he remained for the 49 days following a second rotating order after the public ministry’s agent dismissed the crimes of cohesion and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penalty allegedly for chantaging with a million and a half of pesos to the owners of the Casino Red; however, he only stayed a few hours in the mid-security prison since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was sentenced to arrest by District Second Criminal Court Secretary Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months after investigations sufficient evidence was verified to determine Jonas' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, Casino Red's legal supporter, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the region mayor's brother; so in the upcoming hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the Public Ministry agent adscribed to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garcia Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bet house was the one who granted forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 file, the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and in the subsequent will not be able to submit any claim around the process that followed him; in addition that he will not be required for compensation of damage or punishment.
After the hearing to the legal captain of the betting house, around 15:50 the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Breton was ordered.
The Secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been forgiven legally and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the immediate freedom order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, lost his life, and seven more people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) that the results thrown on the accident where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, lost his life, and seven more people, indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot could attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the aircraft was dismissed, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the suitable for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the requirements necessary to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that in the investigations carried out in the impact zone it is not the appearance of pieces on the ground.
“In a search it is that there are no pieces or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural way.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground has a set of seven degrees to the 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the research could last several months, even could reach a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the President's State Mayor's helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened on an ascending soft ground.
“This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact,” he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
The visual flight:
According to aeronautical normativity the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew should have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
The weather conditions:
The reports at the AICM placed adequate conditions for departure, as the aircraft advances towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico presented low-height cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that by the conditions of cloudiness the crew had sought a zone of less elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and side track.
The pattern of dispersion of the aircraft remains allow to assume that the helicopter was hit on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been found.
There are no evidence on the ship's remains of any kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the research indicate that it may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work have been found pieces of the aircraft at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the middle sea level, the ground presents a pending that goes from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it predictively disarticulated along the said journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the site agreed, around the accident, no dispersed pieces of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the assumption that the impact was presented in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity genes
Lead the Social Insurance a research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it will conduct a research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity' protocol, which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, head of the Unit of Medical Research in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research is invited to participate in the population whether or not right-handed, go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Ponent Mexico State) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Eastern Mexico State).
Once the goal is fulfilled to bring together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue at the Sports Independence Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the 14th of November, the World Diabetes Day was celebrated, he said that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and heredofamily history of diseases, with the purpose of avoiding risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
It detailed that on Saturday it applies to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, size, belt circumference), blood pressure taking, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (seeks to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research obeys the concerns of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys pointed out that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of children, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight also a dramatic rise was observed,” the IMSS specialist said.
He indicated that the justification for the search for the markers arises in the fact that the country’s population differs from others by its genetic history.
He that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent Indian American, 30 percent European and five percent African inheritance and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally, the genetics of obesity translates into the incapacity to burn the excess of energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which allows to detect whether they present some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark color plagues (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, to whom each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic suffering: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high content in fats and proteins and the genetic that is analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid backs
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemistry Faculty, develops modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signs that sends the pavement were addressed, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand baches every season of rain in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphaltic pavement is appropriate, the baches could be reduced in quantity or, even, completely eliminated.
A technological opinion of the backs, dictated in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, gave it to know that the laboratory at its charge develops modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of baches.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbons molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltes, which together give the floor their characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it is behaved as a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius presents a solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken.
The above means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but it is changing during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible floor, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, composed of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he said, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, abundantly, a last layer called rotating folder is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, i.e., a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it’s the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it should have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
By being the part of the floor that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder requires, as well, to have the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made should be cared for.
Climate, especially moisture and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground is moisturized, the water is spread inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a remix of all layers of the floor and, therefore, the formation of baches.
In the process of formation of a bush, he said, the first to go out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of baches and, therefore, the thickness of each of the floor layers should always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is fulfilled, to prevent that baches form frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even in the market and allow to repair the backs with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What missed the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the Crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its title number 14 of Princess.
Again the Cauca Valley remains with the desires of the Crown of Lady Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform with being on the podium of winners, look the silver crown and the band that acknowledge her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday night in Cartagena, where the gentleman Atlantic rose with the crown and the cetro, the department already sums 14 titles of Princess and Melina join the legion of vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many are asking is what is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite who in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the Crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury made to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Literary Carreta Leamos.
At the question the vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is ‘The Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Currently I read Crime and Punishment, it is a book of universal literature that we all must read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalizing" and second by not explaining concrete how each of the books he quoted has marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina manifested feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise pass what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist insinuated that being the preferred, the ovated and the candidate that was given all preliminary awards (Gastronomy Oster, public vote for the best crafty costume, and Queen Mother), "this awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore didn't shine on the stage."
And that was noticed in his first presentation in bathing dress on the Hilton beach and his two parades on the coronation evening.
Although it looked safe in both, it was noticed that it lacked the strength and the impulse that the representatives of Magdalene and the Atlantic did prove.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist from the Channel RCN’s “How at Home” program, said that the fact that Melina was designated princess “confirms that the candidate winning the most awards during the contest does not remain as queen.”
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very shy with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the contest they are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his defects in the derrière and the fibrosis that was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
The reines preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there were better, “but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me wasn’t very notorious, dropped her points in the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, from the magazine Cromos considers that the error of vallecaucana was the surgical interventions that was practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
His body was never his strength, and here he was charged.”
For this prize, which for the first time delivered the National Beauty Competition, after the break in a bathing suit emerged a cruel Vatican that yesterday night was fulfilled, since it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted Melina to not give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that brings her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will pass to history as one of the queens who despite her rolling pass through Cartagena, she was escaping the crown.
This was the work of the cane that identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A Cali lofoscopist passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a Cali CTI lofoscopist passed to history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top head of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the quotation of his digital footprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the CTI section, that week he touched the turn of "disponibility" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the start of his career, González worked in municipalities of the Chocó, where he often had to intern for more than five days in the jungle to get to the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after performing the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the friction skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operative against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear clothes for a minimum of three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left the Cauca on a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two bodies and that he was suspected that one of them was of the man who directed the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the decadactil card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his true name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was located, he did not recognize it for his physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don’t lie.
accompanied by a galtonian lupa, ink, a transplantator and a linterna, Eliazar compared the dactilar impressions of the body with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: he was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was charged with confirming to the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the highest head of the FARC.
Looking for the footprint
For a dactiloscopist of Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press round by the operative against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate, error-free science that can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the people captured.
When they are captured, many criminals present false cards or do not have papers.
We take the fingerprint and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he touched to remove a piece of wall from a house, since in that place the thief had supported his hand to get out a strong box full of jewellery and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to get a fingerprint, but in that case we could get the footprint of all the hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different hurt," he recalled.
The footprints can also discard or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
Recently they found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a family could be suspicious of the crime and, effectively, a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he has been the murderer, he places him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactiloscopist explained that in the objects “the footprints are taken with chemical or physical reactors.”
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to lift them up.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As not everything that shines is gold, not everything that touches becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective quotation is made.
The "indignated" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part observed the order of departure and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday in trying to enter again, under a judicial order, to the Manhattan Square from which they were displaced in the morning and in trying to occupy another Grand Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Zuccotti square, where they wanted to access thanks to a judicial order that allows the “indignated” to re-camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the departure occupying a park more north of the city, where there have been new detentions.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again on the square, we will install ourselves somewhere else and will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through seats and peaceful demonstrations,” Mark Bray, one of the spokesman for the “Ocupa Wall Street” movement, said.
Bray detailed that the response of the “indignated” to the displacement of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignated" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located in the confluence of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police went and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray couldn't confirm the concrete figure, while assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been deployed in a demonstration of support to the movements and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square – which is a private property resort – remains closed waiting for the celebration of a judicial view scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation must be analyzed this morning.
Some of the demonstrators deployed until there carried and distributed at these hours copies of that judicial order and even delivered them to the agents who custodiated the square, which caused "some small confrontations," Bray said, who denounced that some officials threw the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from displacing the members of Occupy Wall Street or applying “laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from reaching the park with stores or other properties they used before.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that judicial order, the city had suspended the re-opening of the space to the public and the protesters, whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to be installed with campaign stores and sleeping bags.
The regidor personally defended the morning departure of the Zuccotti square, an operation in which about 200 detainees were carried out and that was decided because the protesters were “violating the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming “a place where people didn’t come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to hurt other people,” since “some had received threats” and the neighbors feared “for their quality of life.”
“The departure this morning was crazy and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, who accused the mayor of “falting respect for freedom of expression.”
The "Ocupa Wall Street" officials also said they are planning to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV
Together with Michael Bublé and other outstanding Canadians, he will appear in the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1st.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue on "Baywatch", Playboy's cousin, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special of Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (balladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian prominent, will appear in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the broad internet distribution of a pornographic home video in which he appears along with his then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary holding in a puzzle a doll that represents Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin who recently acted as a presentator in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas of CTV has the Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "horry" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan resigns after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5 percent thanks to domestic consumption and ends the fall spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still conveying by the devastating earthquake that devoted to a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that Japan has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the government of Tokyo cifrated the material losses of $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the GDP data between July and September served to pass page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annual rate.
The recorded in the second quarter – for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – also represents the highest growth rate from the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the breakdown of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas affected by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital spending that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted rise.
However, the true revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crises to strengthen – or reconstruct – the infrastructure, to serve the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable escalated by 1%, pushed by the increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been committed to the domestic market, when the yen – the Japanese currency – has become one of the “asleep values” chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbulent U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a loose in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic floating line comes determined by the health of the big technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attached their weak outcomes between July and September to the quote of the yen.
As the markets continue to sit in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government does not lower the guard.
“We need to be attentive to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thai floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” Economic Policy Secretary Motohisa Furukawa said.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) precised that most member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflation points in the world economy pointed out that the main powers are braking.
Since it dropped four decades to the 100,4 points, against the 100,8 in August.
The euro area, even, was below the average, which is at the level 100, by precipitating eight dozen to 99.13 points.
Athens regains doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk primes shattered and the uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece continues to wrap in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transition Government comes more imposed by the Brussels demands than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed in its designation may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the official disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear the doubts about his posture: "We have committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader was a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his good view to any commitment letter to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact caused by the order of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tram" of 8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek wood still has a thread for a while.
Dona Sofia: “They are instruments for progress and hope”
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance."
The Queen Donna Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in these two last decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this intrument of cooperation, whose "essence" pointed out that it lies in being a "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
The Queen inaugurated the V World Summit of Micro-Credit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that the type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in that which has as a goal the reduction to the half of the volume of people living with income lower than a daily dollar, with which the "mile of poverty" is fixed.
Spain "continue working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "garantiate the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, and above all for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
They are “many the achievements achieved” and “many the challenges we face.”
The Micro-Credit Summit is proposed not only as a debate forum, but also as the platform from which to promote “two basic goals”.
So, His Majesty explained that it aspires that at the end of 2015 175 million poor families have accessed these financial services and that a hundred million of those households come out of the threshold of poverty in which they are immersed.
The impulse in the conception of microcrédits in Spain and in the rest of the world "ha followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofia as a "acts of justice and due recognition".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he knows for 15 years, when the queen travelled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her loan policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to constate the continued evolution," His Majesty explained, whose connection with this project valued him yesterday the qualification of the "family head" congregated in Valladolid by the "baker of the poor."
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her intervention encouraging the present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical Imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this sense, he explained that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries to periods of economic bonus, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said micro-credit means "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries should work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, the micro-credit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
On its part, the Secretary of State of International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded “the success” of giving “confidence” to the people “excluded to whom all close the doors”; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that “open its doors contained with the spirit of solidarity”.
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the topic was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government’s policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be so in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate, was adopted by virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that won, with his interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis “is not less Europe, but more Europe.”
Not only because Europe implies peace, but also because “nine million jobs directly depend on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “It’s time to open the way in Europe.”
This could be manifested in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to enable strengthening the European Union’s control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also dismiss the election of the President of the European Commission for universal suffrage to “give a face to Europe”.
In any case, that’s one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble’s idea.
Without a doubt, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country of the European Central Bank directive based on the weight of each economy, which obviously would strengthen the weight of Germany.
Anxious to calm the angels within his party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that he has tried to win his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lie to France.
Except for the past.
Two centuries ago, a bloody battle occurred in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleon.
The Incidence of Fraud in Low Disease
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against the lowest by illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and speak a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, which is part of the will to save rigorously, but still reminds one axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the disease-down.
First, to apply budget cuts: the Government plans to impose the workers of the private sector a fourth day of lack before being able to take the low.
In the end, unless there is a specific enterprise agreement, a worker who falls sick would lose four days of salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would allow to save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing the officials a day of shortness without remuneration in case of low work (up to the moment, they have no shortness, against the three days that are applied in the private sector).
As these issues are debated, the majority again puts on the table equally the topic of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of the low labor.
“The controls will increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, he will have to refund the amounts,” Xavier Bertrand warned speaking on the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
Like in other cases, the effects of the ad appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of low employment.
In fact, since 2002 a constant follow-up of this issue has been carried out and various political offenses have been launched that, normally, have given fruit.
French people are sick more than in the rest of Europe.
First of all, let’s look at national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in low labor benefits.
According to the French Institute of Research and Documentation in the Health Economy, the subsidies for the lowest amounted, in 2008, to 5% of the health expenditure, rising to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to the low for maternity and work accidents, while 54% is related to the low for illness, a figure that rises to 6.2 billion euros.
2.5 per cent of the health expenditure.
In 2010, the French have caught an average of 14.5 days of low work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of leaving for illness.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance disease, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the disease-down had a duration less than 8 days, the 22% between 8 and 14 days, the 15% between 15 days and a month, the 15% between one and three months and the 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbors, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to catch low by disease.
A long 2010 study by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the global job absence rate (both for health and other reasons) oscillated, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the disease-based low is not significant compared to unreferred work.
The fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to the systematic controls of the disease-down for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM verified, in a 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term downs were "unjustified or too long", i.e., 37.050 cases.
In the case of the downs of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duely adapted or unjustified; a figure that, having as part a total of 1.2 million, rises to 132.000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 “unjustified” cases are reached among several million workers who got a low for illness.
Unfortunately, an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, i.e., more than the total cost of subsidies by low and, without a doubt, considerably more than fraud in this latter scope.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to address its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said on Monday 14 November before Parliament; he also added that the hundred days that have been granted to his government of union would not be enough to that goal.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," the head of the government said, who spoke his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of trust in Parliament on Wednesday.
The execution of the decisions adopted during the Euro Zone Summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since the country's stay in the euro zone is "in play", he added.
As a result, Papadémos has forecast that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “up to around 9%” of GDP before the end of year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
EU rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for the already approved measures to try out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party 'New Democracy'.
He pointed out that he was in agreement with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as of fighting the fall, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the loan of €8 billion needed without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything due to the external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to collaborate to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take measures to this effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report from the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends the Government to modify the Criminal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted, when the patient makes such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For the beginning, experts quote a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada occupies the tenth place, the study points out that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death.”
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians don’t have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
The highest rate in this sense is Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
In relation to the delicate topic of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the posture of the federal government, which has already declared that it does not want to modify the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of its application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or of assisted suicide with non-competent persons or that they had not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia or assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal.”
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” explained Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken for euthanasia, since they think it would allow people whose death is near to relieve their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
Moreover, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not make it clear that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for the people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents think that a trial against them should not be initiated.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not imply a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be formed in the duty of respecting the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to collaborate to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee calls for, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, to be considered as euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Experts have made reservations
Other experts in the field of Health Law have already expressed their reservations in relation to the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in Health Law, has qualified “extreme” the posture of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the patients in the terminal phase.
“This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to suicide,” Deschamps said, who consulted a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also highlights that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
The health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called a "manifest in favor of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts in judgment especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus denounces ‘completion’
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bachar al-Assad protesters took place in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar al-Assad who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a “complot” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened the sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighboring Syria, have demonstrated in favour of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to “abandon power” in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime forces have already died.
"If Bachar is really concerned about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country of Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
The head of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts carried out by Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
“Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh posture.
On the other hand, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has celebrated that the "consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the repression in Syria, said State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have already died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Another two civilians have died “during bombings and shootings with heavy ammunition in Jobar” in the affected city of Homs, according to NGO.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid Al Mualem, considers for his part that the country “avances towards the end of the crisis.”
He also strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which, in his opinion, constitutes "a dangerous step."
Syria "will not flaque," he added, guaranteeing that "the conspiracy against Syria will fail."
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to contribute to protect civilians from the repression of the regime that, in his opinion, is "paranoia".
A new extraordinary league meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to set up the implementation of the crisis-out-out plan adopted on November 2, which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has judged the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect" while China urged Syria to implement the outcome plan, although it did not demonstrate its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti calls for time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested some time to the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include “sacrifications” intended to recover the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today he met with the trade unions and the patronal.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside the Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a broad program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that took part in the meetings, after meeting with the appointed Council President.
Deputy House President Gianfranco Fini has said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence to Parliament before Friday to ensure the new government has enough support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr. Monti, of a limited list, undoubtedly a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bonds yesterday, asking for time.
In the “democracy, there are some precise deadlines” to form a government and prepare its program, he said, adding that he is “assured that the markets will have patience and will understand it.”
His appointment by the President initially obtained the well-placement of the markets, but then the concern was imposed, after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team primarily composed of technocrates, even if he highlighted that he would like to include "politics".
The new government will work until 2013, date of the upcoming legislatives, he considers.
Deputies' House President Gianfranco Fini said the new government will get Parliament's trust vote before Friday.
Monti has committed that, when he occupies the office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the goal that Italy "recover its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not its objective of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for the adoption of new strict measures.
Italy’s “head of bosses” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her dead, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, “because a country that doesn’t grow can’t meet the requirements in the field of deficit.”
Monti, famous for his competition and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), implies a "changing of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place before April 2012 about 200 billion euros in state obligations.
Russian scientist collaborates with Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the International Institute of Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) and on other documents issued by such UN agency.
The IAEA expressed last week its "serious concerns" for an "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, extensively based on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
It is believed that he cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to a member state informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his country of origin."
Crimes and Crimes Against Muslims Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violent acts committed against Muslims has passed from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in the case of violent acts against Catholics, a 4% reduction in the crimes against Jews and a global 14% increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to the 6,628 cases, of which a 47,3% is due to racial differences and a 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that such crimes and crimes have increased again,” the human rights organization Human Rights First said, “the increase in violence against Muslims is significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he added, considering that such efforts could include improving police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in the U.S. federal law was inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
That legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to more readily and live follow the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or follow you.
This allows you to know if you follow messages, if you subscribe to new accounts, if you qualify for a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before disseminating it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinct functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to send a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre user) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users have debated a blow of "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me to better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,” writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "Golden Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great social-democratic/Christian coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budgetary to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the Austrian sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure much higher than the maximum limit of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest each year,” said Christian Democratic Foreign Affairs Deputy Chancellor Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responds thus to a request from the Brussels Summit to the Eurozone member countries last October 26: in it, the Chiefs of State and Government asked for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and of the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in an Equivalent Law.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to adopt that kind of “rule”.
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of GDP and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities should submit balanced budgets.
The objective is, by 2020/2021, that the public debt be reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new exchange market intervention
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would re-intervent the exchange mark if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we verify that an excessive volatility occurs" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was up to some levels close to the historic highs that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen per dollar to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has risen gradually since then, driven by the purchases from investors who consider it a “aside value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar returned to be quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching some levels close to which the last intervention caused.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was counted at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it incarnates the Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the incomes obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they turn them into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to reconstruct itself" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east), Noda said, who fears that the yen incarnation cuts the weak recovery.
The world’s third economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5 percent compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in the exports and consumption of the households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister considers that the elevated level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", understanding that no greater monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuance institution increased in five trillion yen (47 billion euros) its Treasury Letters purchases, bringing to the 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of the funds it dedicates to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The Eurozone:
Tickets grow, pockets flourish
The risk of infection from the debt crisis continues to harm European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, European stock exchanges hunt a little more in the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 p.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and lies at 3.064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions in relation to the loans returns of the most affected Eurozone states, the stock markets around the world continue to leave part of their recent profits.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional corner at IG Markets, cited by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing the concerns of market investors about Europe’s ability to counter the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to be carried out on a reduced variation margin, so investors will not have evidence that the situation has stabilized,” says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro zone affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 p.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a 0.4% drop.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that predicts, in particular, the option that a country in difficulties would leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates rise by 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same period offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to the interest rates of the southern countries, although also of France, continue to feed the fears of the interventors.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested time to the markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is at risk of affixing with the weight of its debt.
Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Zone Summit on October 27 would be the "main job" of his government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets, while on Sunday there will be legislative elections.
The difference in rates ("spread") between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain, has reached a new historic maximum.
The Eurozone growth figures
From the statistical point of view, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e., a figure more favorable than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the second quarter figure to the bottom, with a 0.1% reduction in GDP instead of a stagnation.
Moreover, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany, on its part, has recorded a 0.5% growth in the same period.
The first forecast for the euro area is forecast at 11 p.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts must be more valuable than dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that a electoral meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it studies the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will mean the duplication of electricity demand before 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing shortage of fossil resources will have to be palliated to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident did not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which only aims to build central power plants of the latest generation.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for some examples, continue with determination with their projects.
The United States, on its side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, restarting the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island crash.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a speech.
The Berlin election will involve an increase in the price of electricity, a greater energy dependence due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
We need to think about the Danish case.
European champion in the wind sector, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the great consumers of coal and gas due to wind intermittence; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and a 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constance of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity invoice 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy constitutes a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would imply a strong rise in the price of electricity, which would rest realism to the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, do not manifest opposition in principle to that kind of energy, according to the surveys.
Let’s remember that our country’s energy policy has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extremely export-oriented, it covers a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and that can create unlocalizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would involve the sacrifice of a large part of those SMEs and the loss of the 6 billion euros annually in French nuclear equipment and services exports.
Which electricist would charge an EPR designed to operate for seventy years, when the manufacturer’s collapse is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no devil source.
Areva’s development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary character of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control of both the existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In a half-century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two unprecedented natural disasters, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these progress and the cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and constructors, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all electric actors want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, as it would leave them free way to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuveres dominate a debate so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights country" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the titles, with the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of May 23) proclaiming from the past that France "not needs foreign talents, workers or cameras."
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The question is that, on this topic, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the direction declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone fixed Michel Rocard explaining that France "can not take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fountains.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that co-development will allow to solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it comes very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and damages employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, the unqualified, by pressing them to reduce their wages.
But the experience demonstrates that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than replacement of national workers and exercises mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
Positive Effects on Wages
Similarly as a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country that lacks anesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of these latter to positively influence national wages and employment.
Given the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows implies a long-term real wages rise of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants contribute to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are net contribuents to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the International Labour Organization calculates that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income less expenditure) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets of average throughout his lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to search for the growth points that lacked him "with his teeth".
These teeth, which disguised immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it just feels to think about a European democracy.
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the coronels in Greece.
Some may have believed that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon the “Little”, that it was something thought.
The universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough by itself and can even become a “instrument of oppression,” as the former Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return from the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruence.
You need to think about this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now moved and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers no longer advance in the good direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to the needs and in a disordered way.
A sign in white to the absolute European monarch or a high to the empty of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we don’t want to get a hit of effect, but a common exercise, of full right, quiet and continuous, of the options and democracy, this time on European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we’t know where to end the list), because there’s only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that plays to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, than the one that suffers its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We are worried about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that the popular sovereignty recovers the timon of the European project.
Because only together Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debt, get rid of the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The outcome from the crisis will require decisions on a European scale that cannot be taken without a complete democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to the disaster.
After struggling for a long time against this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delors, everybody now demands a European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But thinking about it without a greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new dead point.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to “do” Republicans.
The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us be Europeans.
Chip cards “without contact” are generalized
The world chip card show begins on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (banking cards, SIM cards phone, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is the contactless technology, which allows you to pay for joint transport or shopping simply by approaching the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million uncontact chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its quota should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are forecast) and account for 10% of the world chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been rejected with regard to the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million uncontact MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To put the upper march, however, it is necessary that the banks put them at the disposal of their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically spreading in the future, among their customers, uncontact bank cards,” says Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile Phone
But it only constitutes a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is indispensable for transactions.
“They are regaining.”
"But I should finally experience a real rise next year."
“We predict that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide,” explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a foundation that allows uncontact payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is rising
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algeria “has already the certainty.”
“The way both organizations operate and reports from intelligence services demonstrate that they’re cooperating,” he explained, without providing more details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation on the kidnapping of two French soldiers in Niger last January would have rebounded the gateways.
Rapped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the following day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the ruins of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
The Terrorist Eye
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured especially the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, allegedly, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but we must surely wait to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These last months, such “supportions” had become increasingly obvious in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and the same-style kamikaze or explosive devices as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressed Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group as a community of illuminated people unworthy of interest.
A fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the north Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politizes and demands strict respect for the sharia, while its militants go into the struggle against the impious central government.
These latter are first oriented to the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, the Boko Haram militants were especially active and the attacks on the committees were multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and registered 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, is killed in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and leaves its feud from the north.
The past Christmas, claims an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, then, another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacks Abuya, in particular against the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of this kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia passing through Nigeria, annoys all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram arises as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
Republican candidates for the presidency
In relation to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can a America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential elections, the voters might think that’s so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more and more striking statements on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The slogans are spread, often unfounded, about China, Iran, the aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race towards the designation by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring the Chinese before the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency", a key topic in an American exasperated by the migration of whole fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate that possesses a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns himself in the face of an attitude that “abouts” the emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who remains stained in the depths of the surveys, remains unheard.
The style of Reagan
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if the sanctions fail to interrupt its nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with his obligations in relation to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-class candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "intends to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had military atom since 1964.
The Tehran Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. army in Mexico to fight against the drug cartels.
The appeal to torture against the alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, also predicts Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to throw the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They righteously insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the precipitated departure of the “boys” from Iraq and on their tergiversations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy.
The population judges in a rather positive way the Obama national security balance, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is confident of the military interventions that generate a deforestation.
And, arguing that it is necessary to economically reconstruct America to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia passing through the Baltic Sea, has already been placed in service.
It needs to supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pump.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Head of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and their Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have twisted together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western Europe network.
With this new gas pipeline, every year additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe through a first 1.224 km stretch that communicate the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will allow to supply a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas, i.e. enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, we are already talking about the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas supplies directly to Germany, avoiding land transit by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
At a time, these two countries lose some of their power: for them it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening it by closing access to the Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the topic is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater supply security.
But the price is a weakening of Europe’s energy, since the project has generated a gap between the Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has learned, in just five years, to make its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
“This gas pipeline constitutes a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,” François Fillon confirmed during the opening of the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what point the big gas sector contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles in the faces of Gazprom’s headquarters, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline also implies a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-covered steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It is supported at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mining camps that date from World War II.
“It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, by caution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It is also necessary to extend the measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal serpent that weighs as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
It was planned a control platform in the waters of Sweden, but the project managers renounced it by seeing that the Swedish people were not very willing to allow a Russian state society to establish permanently in the sea on their coasts.
“In case of failure, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas pipeline will thus be released to the atmosphere.
But builders consider it unlikely that a flight will occur, since they have predicted joints that, according to the forecasts, will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline is guaranteed by a submarine robot, trapped by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates through the gas pipeline.
With the shape of a pure, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full days of journey at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without the need for any kind of repair.
The circulation of gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the exit 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of its shares.
It joined the German E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company, called Nord Stream, responsible for building and exploiting the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the taxation is especially favorable.
After that, Gazprom rented the entire gas transport capacity to that company, for a period of twenty-five renewable years.
“Gazprom will pay for its total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The funding of the construction of the gas pipeline has ended in a 30% with the shareholders’ contribution and in a 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach €7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom assumes by itself the risk of the expenditure.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pins.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the gas output door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas at arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
A total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand booklet.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return people the taste for writing.
It has an adventure air, from hours of writing to the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular paste, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine booklets with the current appearance were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch on the market a booklet of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company’s consultant, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a barnized cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the bankets.
This type of booklet was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the twentieth century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who since then became responsible for the brand in Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, to reach a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far has remained the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 pounds were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It’s hard to determine the buyer’s profile, since the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers at its beginnings, now possesses about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre, and has learned to impose its identity.
“We’ve adapted to the times and to the need to write, despite the boom of emails,” says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the “Detour” exhibition where architects or artists expose their own notebook.
In August, he also launched a notebook with leopard tapas, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has learned to diversify its products: pockets, schedules, bills, computer funds... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of Disabled People begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among people with disabilities doubles the average rate: 19%, against 9% for the entire population.
is disadvantaged?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress achieved over the past 15 years is considerable.
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“There is still a lot to do.”
Unemployed persons with disabilities are still facing numerous obstacles to access employment.
They usually have an older age: 37% are over 50 years old (a 17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed the bachelor's degree and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for disabled people, against 38% of average.
That is, there are numerous issues that especially make it difficult to return to the work world and that “constitute the quid of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre for the Cité pointed out that the surveyed directors have “a low level of knowledge on disabilities,” with a “excessive representation of people in wheelchair, physical or intellectual deficients.”
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of hiring a 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“Now we reach around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting the contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", like the amount paid out, has decreased between 2007 and 2011, passing from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects a true awareness, among the big groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the societies that own between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their staff, compared to 82% of the companies of between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: “A Joy”
At the point of confronting the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens don’t hide the pleasure that this friendly match generates.
We will not dare to say that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the Stade de France auditorium street, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have actually made the peace.
Five months after his frontman’s rancor gesture against Turkey, the Belgian selector has nothing more than praises for him.
“I was very pleased for Eden, for his progress and for being a Belgian.”
“I want to move forward,” the frontman of Lille replied.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it's a set," it has been justified.
“I’m in Lille all year, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
“I have to position myself.”
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, finally, "brill".
And we don’t forget the “pleasure.”
She has been encouraging the Bleus since she was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been your fan,” he says.
This will strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
“We just met recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
With simplicity, Leekens has made for its part reference to the “orgot.”
“I’m proud to play a gala game.”
"I'm proud" also to check, as a " neighbor", that France "receives to be a very high-level team," about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our small Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
“They’ll be able to see it in the next matches.” including the match against France.
Portugal has a lot of confidence
Portugal’s Paulo Bento faces a great optimism for the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the match, both teams were missing realism.
“When these 90 minutes go through, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selecçao, which leads since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 Eurocopa.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the match of ida (0-0), Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but he couldn't score the valuable goal that would have given him tranquility.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t marked out of home.”
But at home, at the bright Lights Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of a public that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is obvious that the party “is very equated,” a optimistic but lucid Bento says.
"We hope that the match is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the front," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of participating in the 2012 Eurocopa," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz has relativized.
The Friday match in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a match, although they also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven’t marked out of home,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to “do not leave them time to think.”
It’s a good idea, if this time it’s realistic.
