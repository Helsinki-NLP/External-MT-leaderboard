adekoya has been accused since edinburgh 's supreme court of justice of killing her son.
it is in custody with indictment and trial pending, but any presumption of an eyewitness may have been influenced as its image has been widely published.
this is common practice in other parts of the united kingdom, justice in scotland, but it works differently and the courts have ruled that the publication of photographs is potentially harmful.

of the 1,400 people involved in the poll before the federal elections of 2010, those opposed to becoming australia 's republic increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
deputy prime minister julia gillard supported during the 2010 federal election campaign that he believed that australia should become an unfounded democracy when queen elizabeth ii ended.
34% of those who took part in the poll agreed with this idea because they want queen elizabeth ii to be the last monarch of australia.

it is assumed that it will run for the presidency in 2016.
the federal civil aviation service claims that the new generation air transport system would allow aircraft to carry out shorter routes, save gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
the technology it uses is satellite — unlike the oldest terrestrial technology based on the radar to allow air traffic controllers to identify more accurately an aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
no additional transport is being carried out, and the groundstreets will not stop in webley. car parking areas and the parking and transboarding infrastructures are not available on the ground.
fears of lack of means of transport raise the possibility that the fight will necessarily take place in closed doors, without the group fans.
an investigation notified thursday at science spoke of the existence of a new type of bird in the galapagos islands.
researchers from princeton university of the united states and the university of uffala in sweden said the new species evolved within just two generations, although the process is believed to have lasted much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic spine of darwin of the genus geospiza fortes and the demigradation spine of the genus geospiza conirostris.
gold can be smiled in all shapes. it can be formed in shapes of a minimum size.
it can be smiled in a thin wire form, and then curved and knitted. it can be forged or wrapped in cards.
it can be very thin and stuck in other metals. it can be so thin that sometimes it was used as a decoration in handmade book pictures called "pictograph manuscripts".
this is called the ph of a chemical substance. you can make a indicator using red cabbage juice.
the cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acid or basic (alkali) is the chemical.
the ph level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (h in ph) of the test chemical.
hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (as a hydrogen person consists of a proton and an electron).
rotate the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, push them to become a ball.
the humidity in your palms will react with the outer casings, which will create a strange sense and make something like a peel.
the cities of harapa and mohenjo daro had a toilet with a casino for each house connected to an advanced sewage system.
also, in greece, in the homes of the minological cities of crete and santorine, ruins have been found from sewage systems.
they also appeared in toilets and in ancient egypt, persia and china. the toilets in rome were often part of public bannias, where everyone was a comprehensive crowd.
when you call someone who 's too far away, there' s a satellite used.
the satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to earth almost instantly.
satellite was launched through a rocket. experts have space telescopes because the atmosphere of our planet creates distortions in our light and visibility.
a giant missile of more than 100 feet is required to send a satellite or a telescope to space.
wheel contributions in the world are amazing. the greatest of all is the simplest and fastest move.
thanks to him, we have trains, cars and many other transport machines.
underneath them are cats of more mediumsized size feeding on medium-sized prey from rabbits to antilops and deer.
in the end, there are many predators kittens (including domestic cats released free) chasing after too many bugs, rodents, sauroids and birds.
the secret of their success is the idea of the position, a special role that each cat has, which prevents competition between them.
the lions are the most social eluroids, as they live in complex groups called herds.
the herds consist of one to three adult male relatives with each other with up to 30 females with their young.
females usually have a close link between themselves, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
the lion herds act to a large extent like wolf or dog herds, animals that look amazing to lions (but not with other large heteroids) in behaviour, and are also extremely lethal for their prey.
the tiger, as an integrated athlete, can climb (at no very good level), swim, make huge jumps and put five times more power than a strong man to raise something.
the tiger belongs to the same category (panther genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. these four cats are the only ones who can roar.
the roar of the tiger is not like the sound roar of a lion, but it looks more like a phrase than angry, yelling words.
the ottomans prefer small animals. they 'll hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, even birds. almost all the animals that the ottoman is hunting are smaller than him.
scientists believe that the ottomans follow and find animals to feed (hunt) through smell, smelling the ground to see where they are.
they see very well in the dark through night vision and move quietly. the ottomans hunt their game through their adaptation to their environment and then the sudden attack on their prey.
when a small group of living organisms (small population) is separated from the main population from (for example if they are moved to a serum or a river, or if they are moved to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often meet a different environment than in the past.
this new environment has new sources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adjustments to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
indigenous residents have not changed at all, they need to make the same adjustments as in the past.
as long as the weather goes by, as for the new population, adaptation to the new environment begins, the resemblance to the rest of the population is increasingly smaller.
at some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be regarded as the same species.
this process we call it an alert, which means the formation of new species. alert is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution.
plants create the oxygen that people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale (i.e., breathing).
plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. they also offer shadow.
our homes and clothes are made of plants. the food we eat in their majority is plant. without plants, animal survival would be impossible.
mosasaurus was the top predator of his weather, so he wasn 't scared of anything but the other mosaurs.
his long jaws had over 70 teeth sharp as a razor in combination with an additional series of teeth at the top of his mouth, indicating that there is no way out of anything that went through his way.
we don 't know for sure, but he might have had a corrupt language. he was feeding on turtles, large fish, other mosaurs, while he might have been a cannibal.
he was attacking anything that entered the water. even the giant dinosaur, the tyrannosaur wouldn 't be an opponent to him.
although most of their food would be familiar to us, the romans also had various strange or unusual holiday dishes, inter alia, of the following, boar, peacon, snails and some kind of rodent called glyria.
one more difference lies that the settlers and women ate their food sitting in chairs, while rich men preferred to eat in symposiums where they could relax on their side while they had lunch.
the meals in ancient rome could not contain foods that arrived in europe from america or asia over the next centuries.
for example, there was no corn, tomato, potato or cocoa, while no ancient roman had eaten turkey.
the babylons built for each of their gods a primary temple regarded as the home of god.
the world would devote massacres to the deities and the priest would attempt to respond to the desires of the gods by organising secrets and celebrations.
in each temple there is an open yard and then an internal sacred to which only priests have access.
sometimes there were specific towers built in pyramidoid shape called zigurat, and it was part of the temple.
the top of the tower was a special holiness to god.
in the warm climate of the middle east, the roof wasn 't so important.
the jewish family spent most of her life in the countryside.
women cooked in the yard while the shops were open ice looking down the street. the stone was used as construction material.
hanaan 's land had no large forest areas, so the wood was too expensive.
greenland was diluted. scandinavian saga said eric was banished by iceland for murder and, as he travelled west, he found greenland and gave her that name.
however, despite his discovery, eskimos were already living there this time of year.
although every country was "scandinavian", people, kings, customs and history of denmark, sweden, norway and iceland have been very different.
if you 've watched the film on the traces of the lost treasure, you may believe that in the back of the declaration of independence there' s a map written by a treasure map.
however, that is not true. although there is something written in the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
in the rear view of the declaration of independence, it was written as follows "original declaration of independence issued on 4 july 1776".
although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the great parrot document (dimensions 29 keys for 24 hundred inches) was wrapped in storage.
therefore, the officialisation may simply be added as a labelling.
the attachment to normandy and the battles that followed released the french north, but the south continued not to be free.
it was ruled by the government of visas. it consisted of french that had concluded peace with the germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
on august 15th, 1940, the allies invaded south france; this raid was called operation dragon.
in two weeks, the americans and the forces of free france had released south france and the order was germany.
culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
the word civilization (culture) comes from latin civilis, which means civil (politician), which is related to latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or town called state, and that, in some way, describes the size of society.
the cities of states are the ancestors of the states. culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, to a continuous cultural footprint and an excellent dissemination.
often, smaller cultures are lost without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and failing to be recognised as normal cultures.
during the war of independence, thirteen states at first created a powerless central government - with congress being the only ingredient - based on the confederation statute.
congress had no power to charge taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority, it was based on state authorities, which were not cooperative, to enforce all laws.
furthermore, he had no jurisdiction to overlook the law on taxation and the duties between the states.
the articles demanded unanimous consensus of all states before they could be modified, but the states took the government so badly that their representatives were often absent.
the national football team of italy and germany are the second most successful groups worldwide and indeed were the champions of the 2006 world football cup.
the popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, polo, swordfish, football, bike, ice hockey, skating hockey and car games, formula 1.
winter sports are more popular in the northern countries, with italians participating in international games and in olympic games.
in japan they are nearly 7,000 islands (the biggest is honsu), and it is thus the 7th largest isle on the planet!
due to japan 's complex / group of islands, the latter is often referred to as "archipelago", geographically speaking.
the taiwan principle is lost back in the past, in the 15th century, where passing european seafarers put the name of the island as ilha formosa, i.e. a beautiful island.
in 1624, the dutch east india company created a basis in the southwest part of taiwan and started a transformation into the practices with which the native cereals were produced, employing chinese workers in the rice and sugar plants.
in 1683, the ching dynasty (1644 keeping -@ 1912) dominated the west and north of taiwan that made it an administrative region of their empire in 1885.
after losing in the first sinojapanese race (1984 regar-@ 1985), ching dynasty closes the shimonoseki treaty, where taiwan passes into the hands of the japanese until 1945.
matsuu pitsu is composed of three main structures, namely indiutana, the temple of the sun and the room with the three windows.
most of the buildings of the complex have been built from the beginning to give tourists a better idea of how their original view was.
30% of matsuu pizza had been restored by 1976 and his rehabilitation continues until our days.
for example, the most common form of real estate picture photograph is 35 mm worldwide, which was the most prevailing film size at the end of the analogue film era.
it is produced to date, but the most important thing is the proportion of the dimensions inherited by the forms of digital camera image sensors.
the format of 35 millimetres is actually 36 millimetres wide, which creates confusion, and 24 millimetres in height.
the reason for dimensions of this provision (divided by 12 to achieve the simplest proportion of integral numbers) is therefore 3: 2.
many ordinary forms (the aps form category, for example) are equal or closely approaching these image ratios.
the three law, which is often abused and taunted, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while at the same time maintaining order to a measure in an image.
it declares that the most effective point for the main issue is in crossing the lines dividing the image into three parts perpendicular and horizontal (see example).
during this period of european history, the catholic church, which now had wealth and power, was controlled.
for more than a thousand years, christian religion has created unbroken ties between european states despite any differences in language and customs.
his almighty present power affected everyone, from kings to common mortals.
one of the main beliefs of christianity is that wealth must be used to relieve the poor and those who suffer and the money funds of the churches are gathered specifically for this reason.
the central authority of the church has established rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of powers and wealth has led many to consideration about whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
great britain began to block germany from the sea, immediately after the beginning of the attacks.
the strategy was effective, as cuts were cut into military and political procurement of vital importance, although this exclusion violated the generally accepted international law which has been codified by various international agreements in the last two hundred years.
the united kingdom placed mines in international waters with a view to preventing the movement of boats in each part of the sea threatening even neutral boats.
since there was a limited reaction to this tactics, germany expected the same for its unprevented submarine war.
in the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was peace and isolation.
the states, after seeing the horror and brutality of the war during world war i, wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
in 1884, tesla moved to the united states of america to take a job at edison 's company.
he arrived in the united states with four cents in his name, a poetry book and a recommendation letter from charles bachelor (director in his previous job) to thomas edison.
ancient china had a unique way of differentiating each separate time period. each stage of china or any family in power was also a separate dynasty.
among each dynasty there was also an unstable time of divided province. the most known of these periods was that of the three kingdom that prevailed for 60 years between han and jin dynasty.
in those periods there was a strong war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
the three kingdoms were one of the bloodest periods in the history of ancient china, as thousands of people died fighting for the throne of the great palace in sian.
social and political consequences are many and they include the use of the metric system, a shift from absolution to democracy, patriotism and conviction that the country is not a sovereign, but throughout the people.
also, after the revolution, professions were accessible to all men working seekers, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
the same applies to the army, as instead of being classified under category, it was now on the basis of a calibration.
the french revolution also inspired many other oppressed workers of other countries to start their own revolution.
mohammed was very interested in issues beyond this cosmic life. he often visited a cave known as "hira" in the mountain "noor" (light) for a collection.
the cave itself, where she survived in time, provides a very vivid image of the spiritual cliche of mohammed.
the cave is far from the world as it is on the edge of a hill north of mekka.
in fact, it 's not easy for someone to find it even if he knows his existence. once you' re in the cave, you 're in complete isolation.
nothing is visible beyond the clean, beautiful sky and the many around mountains. very few things in this world are visible or can be heard from the inside of the cave.
the great pyramid of giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
the great pyramid, built by egyptians in the 3rd century e.g., is one of the many large buildings in pyramid form constructed for the price of the dead pharaoh.
the giza plateau, or "necropolis of giza" situated in the valley of the dead of egypt, has various pyramids (larger than the pyramid of heopa), some small graves, several temples and the great sphinx.
the large pyramid was constructed in honor of faraoh heopa, and many of the smaller pyramid size, as well as the smaller graves and temples were built for honor of the wife and members of the family of heopa.
the mark indicating that the glory must move upwards looks like v and the sign indicating the move downwards looks like a wire of stapling or square that does not have its lower side.
play upwards means you have to start from the edge, push the glory and play downwards means you have to start with the frog (i.e. the point where your hand holds the glory) and pull it.
the play of glorious upwards produces a softer sound, while playing downwards is stronger and more dynamic.
you are free to put on your own marks, but take into account that what there is is some music function, so they often need to be taken into account.
on 6 october 1789, a market women 's mob forced king ludovico east, queen maria antoinetta, their two young children (the 11-year-old maria theressia and the four-year-old louis carolo) and the sister of the king, mrs elizabeth, who had been terrified, to return from versailles to paris.
they traveled back to paris to a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and threatening the king and the queen.
the crowd forced the king and the queen to open the windows of their wagon wide.
at some point, a person from the mob started screaming at the head of a member of the royal guard who was killed in versailles in front of the terrified queen 's eyes.
the costs of the united states imperialist war on the conquest of the philippines were given by the philippine people themselves.
they were forced to pay taxes to the us colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs and the bond interest was motivated on behalf of the philippine government through wall street banking houses.
of course, the overprofits arising from the long-term exploitation of the philippines were going to be the main profits of american imperialism.
in order to understand the templates, one must understand the framework that pushed the battalion into creation.
the time when events occurred is often called as the ultimate medieval, the period of european history in the 11th, 12nd and 13rd century (1,000 ran-@ 1.300 p.d.).
the high middle ages followed the early medieval ages and preceded the ultimate medieval age, which, under circumstances, ends around 1500.
technological justification is a condition, which includes a variety of ideas in practice, from promoting or imposing technology, until the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to scientific laws and their outlook at technology.
most interpretations of technological dederminism share two central ideas: that in itself the development of technology follows a path to a large extent far from cultural and political influence and that technology exercises in order "influence" in inherent societies, rather than in societies adapted to today.
for example, one might claim that the car necessarily leads to road development.
however, a road network of national scope is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are developed to reduce the ownership costs of the car.
the massive ownership regime also leads to higher rail accidents, which, in turn, lead to new methods in healthcare for the recovery of physical damage.
romance had an important element of cultural dederminism, derived from writers such as gaites, phikte and schlegel.
in the context of romance, geography has formed people and over time has emerged custom and cultural elements in relation to this geography, which, being in harmonisation with the position of society, were better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
as paris is considered a source of style in modern times, so is istanbul the corresponding european source at feud.
his reputation as the center of plenty began to spread around 400 a.d. and lasted up to about 1100 a.d.
his prestige decreased in the 12th century, basically because of the crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which had a higher value than the products of the byzantium markets.
that 's when the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from istanbul to paris.
the gothic style reached its edge in the period between the 10th and the 11th century, as well as the 14th century.
at the beginning, the dress was strongly influenced by byzantine culture in the east.
however, slow communication channels entailed delays of 25 to 30 years in technology in the west.
at the end of the middle ages, western europe began to develop its own pen. one of the most important developments in the time, which came as a result of the crusades, was that people started fixing their clothes with buttons.
georgia maintenance is georgia that takes place to produce enough food to meet only its needs of the farmer and his family / her.
survival georgia is a simple, usually a biological system for the use of stored seed derived from the ecosystem in the region, combined with changes in crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximise the crop.
traditionally, farmers in their majority were dealing with self-preservation agriculture and this is still happening in many developing countries.
subcultures unite people with the same views, which feel marginalised by social standards, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
undercultures are divided by a criterion of how old the member, where he originates, his social order, where he is and / or racial discrimination.
the properties of a subculture that makes it special can be linguistic, sensual, religious, political, sexual, geographical or combination of factors.
to mark their capacity, members of a subculture often adopt a characteristic and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, special behaviour and argos.
the main technique for the meaning of socialisation is to rely on the minimum unlucky incidents of children who, due to negligence, misfortune or abuse, did not interact with adults during their lives.
such children are called "wild" or wild. some wild children have isolated them by humans, usually their own parents. in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to rejection from his parents due to serious mental or physical disability of the child.
wild children are likely to have experienced serious abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or run away.
for others, they are said to have been raised by animals; some are assumed to have lived alone in nature.
a wild child, when raised entirely by animals without having been in contact with humans, presents behaviour (within the natural boundaries) that are almost entirely alike to those of that animal who took care of it, such as fear or indifference in humans.
while project teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, aids are taking another step.
begging is not a way of learning, but more a hand of help to people who are subject to a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
there are virtual and genuine creepy, in other words, the teacher is a form of creepy, but the same applies to microsoft office 's little ran-@ connector.
virtual aids are incorporated into the software and are intended to ask, promote and explain the procedures for which handling may have been very difficult for students.
children are placed under foster parents care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse, even until blackmail.
no child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love and education, but it happens.
we understand the foster aid system as a secure zone for these children.
the foster care system we have is deemed to provide safe houses, loving people offering care, steady education and healthcare.
the care of foster parents is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the house he was removed from.
the internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
the specific characteristics of the internet result in additional dimensions as regards the approximation of uses and remuneration.
for example, learning and "socializing" is considered to be significant incentives to use the internet (james and a., 1995).
the "personal participation" and "continuous relations" were also identified as aspects of impetus by eighmey and mccord (1998) in investigating public reactions on websites.
the videotape has helped great findings in understanding the microscopic expressions, namely our expressions which hold infinite.
in particular, it is said that one can understand whether one person is lying, correctly interpreting microphrases.
oliver sacks in his thesis entitled "the president 's speech", says people who are unable to understand the speech due to brain damage are, however, able to distinguish honesty with accuracy.
it is also considered that these skills in how human behaviour is understood are presented to animals such as domestic dogs.
a twentieth century investigation showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, lanthane and expressed.
mutation adds new genetic variants and the choice removes them from the container of expressed variants.
discrimination and mixing redistributes diversity between the two sides to each family.
outside in savannah, it is difficult for a primary mammal with a digestive system like the human to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant resources.
furthermore, their failure in this particular had serious consequences: reduction of growth, underwater and ultimately death.
the most directly accessible plant resources would be proteins that can accede to the leaves and leftovers, but it is difficult to be assimilated by primary mammals as we are, unless they are cooked.
on the contrary, animals (ants, termites, eggs) are not only hopeful, but are also important sources of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
considering all the evidence, it doesn 't surprise us that our ancestors faced "protein issue" as chimps do in savannah right now.
sleep interruption is the process in which you are consciously awakening during the normal space your sleep lasts and sleep again after a while (10 secret -@ 60 minutes).
this can be easily done using a relatively quiet awakening clock to acquire your senses without fully awakening.
if you catch yourself closing the alarm while you 're asleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so you need to get up to disable it.
other options based on biorythm include consumption of many liquids (especially water or tea, known for its diurinary capacity) before sleep, so that it is forced to rise to urine.
the amount of internal peace one person has is reverse to the size of the tension in his body and spirit.
the less pressure is, the better the vital force that is present. each person has the ability to find absolute peace and pleasure.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. all they stand as obstacles to this objective is the tension and negative of each of us.
tibetan buddhism is based on buddha 's teachings, but it was expanded from the path of mahayana' s love and many techniques of indian yoga.
tibetan buddhism, first of all, is very simple. it consists of quadalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everything.
in kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightening) awakens because of movements, inhalation and exhalation practices, mantra and optimism.
the focus of tibetan meditation is the goddess yoga. through the visionary of various gods, energy channels are cleaned, chacks are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
germany was a common enemy in world war ii, leading to co-operation between the ussr and the uk. at the end of the war conflicts at system, processes and culture level, led the two countries to a breakdown.
as two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and became the beginning of the cold war.
it would have lasted for 40 years and would have had war controversials by representatives, at points of battle from africa to asia, afghanistan, cuba and many other areas.
by september 17th, 1939, poland 's defence had already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup to the romanian bridge.
however, these plans ceased to be a benefit in almost one evening, when more than 80,000 soldiers of the red army of the soviet union entered and created the front of belarus and the front of ukraine, after invading the eastern territories of poland by violating the riga peace treaty, the non-attack pact between the soviet union and poland and other international conditions, both bilateral and multilateral.
the use of ships for the transport of goods is far the most efficient way for the overseas movement of large parts of the population and goods.
the work of the seafarers from the old days was to ensure that your country can carry your own people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from transporting its own and its goods.
one of the most remarkable recent examples was the campaign in the north atlantic during world war ii. the americans were trying to carry men and materials across the atlantic ocean to help britain.
at the same time, the german navy, using mainly submarines, attempted to interrupt this traffic.
if the allies failed, the germans could probably conquer britain as they did with the rest of europe.
goats were probably tamed for the first time in iran 's zagros mountains 10,000 years ago.
ancient cultures and tribes start keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
domestic goats were generally kept in herds wandering around hills or other grazing areas, often noticed by ovine and caprine animals who were usually children or teenagers, respectively of the wider known grazing methods. these farming methods are still used in the days.
wooden tracks were built in england already since the 16th century.
although the wooden tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planes, they allowed the horses dragging the wagons to achieve larger speeds and draw bigger loads than the few harder roads of the day.
the wooden rail links appeared early enough and intended to keep the rail tracks in place. but gradually, it seemed that the tracks would be much more functional with an iron support at the top.
this was an ordinary method, but iron created more destruction in the wheels of wood wagons.
finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron roses. 1767 made their appearance the first railways consisting solely of iron.
the first known means of transport was walking, people started walking up two million years ago with the appearance of homo rectus (which means standing man).
their predecessors, the australians didn 't walk up like usual.
bipoetry elements have been found in australian fossils from 4,2 – 3,9 million years ago, although the sahel man may have walked on two feet even seven million years ago.
we have the possibility of leading a more sustainable life, becoming a member of the environment movement, and perhaps we will act activist so that we can somehow reduce the problems of the future.
it is like tackling symptoms in many incidents. but if we do not want a progressive treatment, we will need to discover the source of the issues and inactivate them.
it is quite obvious that the world has changed very much because of the scientific and technological achievements of humanity, and that the problems have grown because of the overpopulation and the spatter of life.
after congress was approved on 4 july, the manuscript note signed by congress president john hancock and secretary charles thompson sent a few blocks away to john dunlap 's printing office.
during the night, 150 to 200 copies were issued, now known as dunlap 's brunettes.
the first public reading of the document was carried out by john nixon on 8 july in the external area of the independence chamber.
one copy was sent on july 6th to george washington, who had it read in his troops in new york on july 9th. another arrived on august 1st in london.
dunlap 's 25 brunettes that we know still exist are the oldest saved copies of the document. the original manuscript wasn' t saved.
many scientists of paleontology today consider that some kind of dinosaurs survived until today. they refer to birds.
they do not see them in the category of dinosaurs enough because they have a ferocide having the ability to fly.
but many things in birds make them look like dinosaur.
they have legs with veils and nails, they give birth to eggs, and they walk on their two legs like tyrannosaurus rex.
computers are now based on the management of the information coded by a binary system.
to use computer terminology, a binary number can only receive one or two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called two digits or beach.
internal poisoning may not be directly evident. symptoms such as vomit are generally enough to make a direct diagnosis impossible.
the most valid sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open bottle of medicine or some toxic household chemical in space.
read the label for special first-aid suggestions for this particular poison.
the term korean is officially used by the verdict for this group of insects.
this term comes from familiar with the ancients with the bugs, which were insects that were easily adapted to fostering people.

in the united states of america, it is known about 40,000 incidents of width sclerosis (sg), making the main neurological condition among the youngest and middle-aged.
plaque sclerosis is a passion affecting the central nervous system whose brain, spinal cord and optical nerve are parts of.
the investigation shows that women are twice as likely to be diseased by sclerosis on the side as compared to men.
two comrades can decide that raising a child is not in their interest or in the interest of the child they have.
these couples can plan a adoption plan for their baby.
in adoption, biological parents end their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
the main objective of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methodology. this method is essentially directing most scientific research.
but there is not only one experiment, and specifically the experiment is a test carried out to bring down one or more possible cases, the submission of questions and the observation are also directing scientific research.
naturally, philosophers focused on classical texts, namely the latin version of the bible.
aristotle 's positions on scientific issues, including psychology in them, enjoyed acceptance.
as greek understanding lost ground, the west was cut off from its greek philosophical and scientific roots.
many have noticed that often the rhythms in physiology and behaviour depend on intragenous cycles, as well as on their production made through biological clocks.
periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living beings, including bacteria, muscles, plants and animals.
biological watches are self-preserved smugglers, which continue their circular function instantly even when they do not have external stimulants.
the hersey and chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that dna is genetic material.
hercy and chase took eats, or germs, so they could put their genetic material in some bacteria.
they conducted two experiments noting either dna in the eat using radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the eat using radioactive sulphur.
mutations may lead to a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the role of the part of the genetic material on which it influences and whether the cells affected are stem cells.
only mutations in stem series cells can be inherited to the offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause the death of cells or cancer.
the tourism of nature attracts people looking for natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the region.
examples of activities at a given location are hunting, fishing, photograph, observation of birds, and the parks visit, as well as the ecosystem information study.
for example, some people visit, photograph and learn about the uractanges of vorneo.
every morning, people leave small cities with their cars to go to their workplace and meet with others, where their destination of work is the place where the first ones just left.
in transport dynamic shuttle, everyone is linked to each other somehow and support a transport system based on private vehicles.
today, science shows that this huge coal economy has removed the biosphere from a stable situation that has supported the evolution of human species over the past two million years.
each person participates in society and uses a transport system. and everyone almost expresses complaints about transmission systems.
developing countries rarely sound complaints at the same level about water quality or bridge collapse.
why are the transportation systems making such complaints, why are they failing every day? is it just that the transport engineers are incompetent or is it something more substantial?
traffic flow is the analysis of the circulation of specific drivers and cars between two parts and interactions between them.
unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to provide for drivers behaviour in full confidence.
fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; so traffic streams tend to have reasonable consistency and their mathematical representation can take place approximately.
for the better representation of traffic intensity, relations between the three main characteristics have been established: (1) tension, (2) density and (3) speed.
these relationships helped prepare, design and functions of road network facilities.
the first animals that took off were insects. their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies easier and find food and comrade more effectively.
most insects have the advantage of the ability to refold their wings along their bodies backwards.
this gives them a larger variety of small hiding than predators.
now, the only insects that can 't fold their wings are liberia and newspapers.
many years back, the chief said the solar system was turning the perimeter of the sun.
some believed he was right, but many considered the opposite, namely that the solar system was moving around the earth and the sun (even around other stars).
it makes sense, since the earth doesn 't look like it' s moving, does it?
the amazon river is the second largest in length and the largest overall river on the planet. it carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
the amazon is also the river with the largest width of the world, which sometimes reaches 6 miles.
20% of the water exposed by the rivers of earth in the oceans comes from the amazon.
the main river of the amazon has a length of 6.387 km (3.980 miles), raising water from thousands of smaller rivers.
while the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the old kingdom, no one exceeded the pyramids of giza in size and technical integrity in construction.
the ancient egyptians of the new kingdom were impressed by the memories of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
the residents of the vatican city are approximately 80.it is the smallest independent state in the world and this with the smallest population.
the vatican uses italian language in its legislation and official communications.
the italian language is also used in daily quality by most people working for the state, while latin language is often used in religious ceremonies.
all the citizens of the vatican city are roman catholics.
the man knew the existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper from antiquity, as all this can be found in nature in raw form and mining them with primitive tools is relatively easy.
the philosopher aristotle believed that everything was created by the involvement of one or more of the four elements, i.e. earth, water, air and fire.
mostly it seemed like the four forms of matter (with this sequence): solid, water, air and plasma, although it even assumed that they are changing to new substances to form this presence.
alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. remember that there are many chemical elements in the magazine table.
elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. there are other metals such as silver and gold.
there are also alloys containing small quantities of asymmetals such as coal.
everything in the universe consists of material. the whole matter consists of very small particles, individuals.
the size of people is so very small that trillion of them could fit at the end of this proposal.
so the pencil when he showed up became a good friend for many.
unfortunately, as younger graphics appear, the position and usefulness of the pencil has been degraded.
people are now writing messages on computer screens without ever having to catch a scratch.
someone can ask themselves what happens to the keyboard when something younger comes up.
the fiscal bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to form a core with many protons and neutrons.
as if he 's sluggling a heavy cart over a hill again, breaking the core is released part of this energy.
some people have unstable cells, and that leads them to splitting if they 're under small or even no pressure.
the moon surface consists of stones and dust. the outer pile of the moon is called bark.
the bark is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the remote side.
he 's thin under the seas and thicker under the altitudes.
it may be more seas on the nearby side, because the bark is dilute. lava could better go to the surface like that.
the contents theories focus on discovering what clicks people or what attracts them.
these theories argue that individuals have certain needs and / or desires that have been internalised as they grow up and reach adult.
these theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will lead them to do or not do specific things.
two popular contents theories are that of the hierarchy of the needs of mallow and that of hertzberg 's two factors.
in general, two behaviour can appear if the directors start guiding their former petitions. the one end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the children" (or one).
this kind of director is having trouble making non-popular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, performing evaluations, assigning responsibilities and putting people before their responsibilities.
on the other side of the spectrum, one can be transformed into an unknown person who feels that he or she must change everything the group has done and be familiar with.
in the lower ran-@ downstairs, the one who is finally responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
this behaviour often ends up breaking between the leader and the rest of the team.
virtual groups are created with the same principles of integrity as contractual groups, however, there are small differences.
the virtual members of the group often act as a liaison to their immediate physical group.
they are often more autonomous than conventional members of the group, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
the existence of a true "invisible group" (larson and la fasto, 1989, page 109) is another unique element of a virtual group.
everyone is presented to the "non-visible group" management. it sets out the specifications for all participants.
why would an agency want to pass this timetable process of introducing the learning of the agency 's capabilities? one of the objectives for the practical implementation of the concepts of learning the agency' s possibilities is innovation.
creativity and intelligence shall be favoured when appropriate use of all available resources in the functional parts of an organisation is made.
as a result, the procedure under which an organisation cooperates to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes in favour of serving the customer 's needs.
to enable an agency to be innovative, the administration must create an environment of innovation, knowledge exchange and organisational learning.
the explanation given by angel (2006) for the approach to continuous learning describes it as a method used to help organisations to reach their level of performance.
neurobiological evidence offers physical evidence for a theoretical study of the disease. so they limit the width of the investigation by making it clearer.
the relationship between the pathology of the brain and behaviour is a help for the investigators and their study.
it has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries and volumes have affected behaviour and may cause changes to certain psychic functions.
the emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that man has never seen before.
this gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that are done in our minds.
although artificial intelligence largely refers to scientific imagination, it is, however, an important part of it that deals with adapting behaviour, learning and intelligence to a machine.
research into artificial intelligence includes the construction of machines for automating work requiring intelligent behaviour.
examples include control, programming, responses to client diagnoses and questions, but also manual writing recognition, oral rationale recognition and facial recognition.
these are now separate principles, which focus on providing solutions to real daily problems.
the ai system is often operated in the sectors of economic, care, engineering and armed forces, while it is, in fact, involved in various applications of household and cyber computer software and toys.
trips are an important element of every class. very often a teacher would like to go with his students to places where bus access is not an option.
technology offers the solution with virtual outlets. students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while they are in their class.
in fact, participation in a trip is also an important opportunity to consider the journey and share experiences with future classes.
for example, every year students from northern carolina 's bennet school are planning a website on their journey to the state capital, and every year it is renewed, but old versions are kept online and serve as a scrapbook.
the websites can also contribute to improving the formula of the student. while students' experience in the websites often begins with bad grammar and spelling, the presence of a common generally changes that.
as students are often the most critical audience, the editor of the website begins to do its best to improve his way of writing in order to avoid criticism.
also, participation in "forcing students to become more understandable about the world around them." the need to maintain public interest inspires students to become smart and interesting (toto, 2004).
the management of a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and urges students to learn more than they learn classic at school in the morning.
the proper use of websites "can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active response to internet material, students can define their positions in the texts of other people, as well as express their own views on specific issues" (oavec, 2002).
ottawa is the magical, stimulating capital of canada, which includes a large range of paintings and museums indicating the old and modern canada.
more south are the falls of niagara and in the north lies the unexploited natural beauty of muskka and even further.
