The Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament has rejected, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the draft cancellation of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Yulia Tymoshenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected in second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former prime minister currently imprisoned.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for concluding an a priori unfavorable agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court is due to decide on the convict’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime and has provoked a process of suspicion of court bias also in the West.
The bill to repeal paragraph 365 of the Criminal Law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Victory of Libya
Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its defeats.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners remain to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but whether they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia and we already know what it is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a theft one cuts off the hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the eventual non-respecting of the faith are punishable with the death penalty.
It is the Qur’an that will unite in the place of the dictator’s personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
There will be such an order in Libya as we cannot imagine and as we would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial to the Libyans.
It is surprising that Islamist warriors accepted the help with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who directed the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
Therefore, there is no problem for locals to get rid of the "crossroads".
Without land occupation, oil companies would easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Per not so much and the West will eventually boast of a protection of human rights stakeholders.
This is not the case for the Sharia disciples.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sight of investors.
A tornado of statistics hit Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published GDP data for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistics offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5% and France by 0.4%.
Both countries modified the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better positioned than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of 0.1% expected), however France a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a question at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decrease in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts predicted.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy grew 0.5% in the third quarter according to the forecasted and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had forecast.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 percent.
Ten-year yield on bonds is 28.45%
The yields of Spanish and Italian bonds are rising to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation in the region deteriorates.
There are voices in Germany that say that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualifying for 200 million
The football team has achieved their most difficult task of the season.
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the Super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football safely defended with also a good share of luck in the second half of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech national team also won thanks to the super-Czech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for the European Championship.
The Montenegro were under pressure until in the second half due to a precise Czech defense.
The victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and in addition a prize of 200 million crowns in the box office of Czech football.
In the first few minutes we played football.
Both teams had difficulty mounting combinations and the game was mainly concentrated around the central line.
The pressure from the national footballers did not get through the Czech defense which responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Some hundreds of high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
Students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the U.S. and Israel.
Several hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Isfahan where uranium is being processed.
They openly expressed that they would defend their country’s nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose goal would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: Don’t take breakfast and take food for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren are over-average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This once again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the patterns that surround him are.
On the tables of obese children, for example, charcoal is found 50% more often than in families of children with a normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an action of awareness "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of the big little sports is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 students from Czech primary schools.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight, or even obese, is the lack of proper nutrition and insufficient exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case-lunch-tasting-dinner, which is one of the basic principles of good nutrition," one of the findings of the survey says.
No breakfast and snacks at dinner.
Experts draw attention to the fact that in order to have a healthy development you need some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families eat at the same time.
Most families eat breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that one-tenth of the population doesn’t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of good daily nutrition.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sweetened drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed do sports regularly, but for parents this is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own meals from options offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from the ideal in terms of healthy eating.”
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a high preference for sweetened limonades," the survey finds.
For lunch, it was the pasta that took the first place just ahead of the white meat.
The children did not want fertilizers at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head to Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
“During a control of a group of survey participants who had filled out the questionnaire after the ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’ awareness session, a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet was demonstrated,” the survey finds.
The most striking was, for example, when it comes to sweetened limonades as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweetened dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potato chips).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I did not think about what would happen next.
The exhibitions of three professionals of the specialty, the dressing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it will be worse.
The closer we approach the final exams, the more practical exercises and information we expect.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it’s really “drunk”.
This time we have with director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
Such women are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy’s body, with no particular curve, the other is overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically handle wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus come to accentuate the character beautifully and also not to dress too apparently types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and thin waist.
If there is, for example, a difference between the height and hips so that the shirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth making it tailor-made.
And you won’t regret it because the clothes that fall impeccably are invaluable.
In a tailor-made shirt you will feel much better than in one that continually slides, wraps and doesn’t stick to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style dress, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even brothers.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I’m glad that I have the whole week to sort out all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that in terms of what I have to do at home there is too much.
Each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to consider the current appearance, the fashion type of the personality as well as its appearance.
I’ll have to “dress” Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the Victoria’s Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it pleases me, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred kilos lately (do not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search on the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as they say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only clothes the body, but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphic designer, talked to us about all this.
And that until Sunday.
The designer needs to have a general view.
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka, fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one clothes differently.
Variability is the primary example.
Like for example this trench-coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scarpins and take it in photo as a dress.
Or just pick up the sleeves or neck and get a new look right away.
“Play with it,” he said.
But I liked the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
“You can then start violating it,” Jakub said.
Finally I understand why one struggles to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines one sometimes sees something else.
No comments on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for a fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be prepared to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We need to take this into account when creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half of the success has been confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services remains frigid.
And familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (I just know something, but what I appear goes to the second place).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
It remains to us then to navigate on Google and make sure if the boulevard information states the celebrity in question, if she has leaned or fattened etc...
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to be oriented in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He needs to communicate with the people he dresses up and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not flatter themselves, to keep their opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items, you can’t throw it all away and say, God, what a horror.”
"You'll find a few things that you'll find beautiful and he'll advise you with what to wear them," says Mario.
This showed us specifically what everything should contain what is called the "placovka"or the stylist's bag.
It’s the one you hang around the waist and have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rolls for depilation or nursery sticks, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the sticks or other type of clutch are not useful because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we were not only people who listen but who tried something practical they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sol may break down, fortiori on the outside.
So we grabbed and grabbed.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors to avoid being injured inadvertently.
Indeed, there is a need for competence.
Mario was delighted when he congratulated me for my creation.
The responsibility I’m referring to is not for my wife.
This is just a short summary of what we learned during the second class weekend.
I am increasingly beginning to understand that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The Need for Speed Run is disputed all over America.
Revision of
Originally a trouble-free race turns into a set of stupid mistakes by people who have nothing to do with a routine morning trip to work.
It fulfills everyone’s ambition to a certain extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do anything else.
The new subtitled The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already outdated Need for Speed racing series and bring out a kind of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be during which the main character gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the set shoots down because of a few unnecessary bugs that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fancy on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught in the adventure in which the main character Jack has character problems and to resolve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 courses.
As a result, each race is done on a different route and the stages are planned in different environments that differ quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are pretty beautiful even though the technical level is the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowed mountains is very pleasant visually.
The trials are in addition occasionally decorated with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
Sometimes you struggle to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race), then you run against the clock (classic duel with the timepiece) and then yet another duel with an opponent awaits you.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The main feature is passages outside of the vehicle.
It’s rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is this because this element does not risk bothering and places, in the context described above, in the elements that adorn the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of the previous games.
That means that at the moment there is nothing extraordinary, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As for the realistic simulation you will have to go see elsewhere.
But while one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of race design.
So everything is OK.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, that of the collisions is not yet in point.
We do not expect from this game complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it is not entirely good.
During tight surpasses you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self goes into crazy voltages.
Or they find themselves in trouble.
With the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken your figure or you have gone out into the setting the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
Once you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it’s more a tool, in case something isn’t going well, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and you need to find the solution by remembering the route in question.
The great thing about this game is that the same things happen in the same place.
For example, there are certain turns that must be passed in some way otherwise it doesn’t happen.
Otherwise you encounter in a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration whether you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or a minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and conturb them or brake.
It doesn't matter if you go in front of him because it's "calculated"so that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During the whole time of the game, you get to certain places, again without worrying about the weather, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This is most annoying at the end of the game when you drive on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must go ahead of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides you the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a lot of times.
One can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a pity because through a simple driving pattern the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it does not matter if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during races.
You should be careful of gasoline pumps on the routes as you can change car there but most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. cylinders for straight highways, and super sports cars with exotic performances on highly technical routes, for example on rough roads in mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main scheme of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog function that, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car into the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway wheel that sends you the car directly to the wheel.
At the editorial board we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really think of us as idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What annoys is that in more extreme situations, the image does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This especially applies to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image is no longer useful.
The sound is good and the track is good.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack was created in the style of "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game does not seem to be over.
Fun is really good but be prepared for mistakes tapping you in the eye with the strength of an airfield reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," this is how Milena Vicenova began her exhibition at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU bodies and their relationships in such a understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from the Charles University Law Faculty could envy her, she showed how she takes her motto "understood and open about Europe" very seriously.
Ms Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, criticisms resonated that he’s dull, that he’s a rookie, that he can’t fulfill any mission and I have to say that he cut off everyone’s breath because he holds his role to perfection.”
"He is a man who can listen to the 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to be taken by Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of a response to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "Which phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards uniqueness and greater legibility of the EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our syrecky (cockroaches that smell very strong)
Ms. Vicenova also stated the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs solved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to Ms. Ambassador’s words, “activity has reached its full” not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve itself now.
In addition, the new seven-hour budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and in terms of savings, which branch will have the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted corns, differently large bananas, or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.”
She wants to better use the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
In addition, it is regrettable to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, results from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she subsequently highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when the Polish, the Hungarian, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, ‘Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group of Visegrad doing?’ and he is not at all happy.”
According to Ms. Vicenova, in the near future it is new tough fiscal policy rules that await member countries.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, which prevails rather than a “new European Federation”.
“We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
First, it was said that countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that don’t want to remain in their corner.”
"There will be a lot of institutions of this type and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
From this perspective, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues affecting the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not just the eurozone members.
History of a Brand:
IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the word that most closely expresses IBM’s strategy, the closest one would be “long-term”.
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the company’s first CEO, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a lot of global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENS!" became the footprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the foundation of Watson’s care business culture.
For us, IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it remained faithful to its core values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will even more"declared for the birthday the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began taking care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic – IBM people were the only among the first American employees to have paid vacations, an employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-designed system of rewards for inventors and commercials.
Similarly, IBM has a well-designed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has done what is called the jamy, the online brain- storming from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the company there are almost 500,000 people working.
A company with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a secure position in the field of business.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is known in the United States because of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest global firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology company – it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services from server products to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the disquette.
IBM was the second largest technology company in terms of market capitalization this year with $220 billion (the first was Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Viewed in advance
It is not all the innovations and manufactures that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example failed to bet on an operating system own OS/2, the online service Prodige or the computer IBM PCjr:
“From the moment your business is built on moving forward you can’t emotionally stay stuck on the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the competitor Microsoft, which at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
Technology in perspective
In IBM’s revenue, services, which are made up for a fifth by software and hardware, have a leading place.
However, even in 1990 it was with more of the motivated participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during which period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM traded according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Is it now apparent that IBM goes through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM stock has progressed from 2008 to 120 percent, the company's net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect that this flexible giant will cope with other crises.
IBM’s story: From cheese slices to space flights.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 – initially it was a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They possessed technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendules that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 was chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then shadowed the company's founder - it was on Watson's ideas that the company's identity and culture so far rested.
Watson headed the Kusqu' Company in 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, started with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - from cheese and meat cutters to cash.
During the first four years of Watson's reign, revenue multiplied to $9 million and the company began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the company that after 40 years of management his son took the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM’s people and computers helped NASA guide flights into space – on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 on the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but acquired the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM over the past three years – is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet”.
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and urban management.
In terms of business, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps marketers manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
You can keep that donkey, I don’t want it anymore.
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said it is over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of d'Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can go home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum to Bartosova in her home in the summer, she did not suspect that her couple would not stand.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push back the singer.
He admitted in public that he loved him.
Over time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband’s bond and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
“He’s the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my old beloved and lost donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has separated from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I will stay with Iveta and will not change.”
“My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it.”
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk completely normally but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he will not stop her.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she’s going, with whom or if she’s in a relationship.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility,” concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does it apply to you too?
If you ask men to determine typical female vices, everyone, just like each other, is able to get them out of their sleeve.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices that get to pump the blood from the veins of men.
The purchases
Does your partner tell you that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one clothes a week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of sales?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should limit their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would resist the slide of clothing stores, to look for beautiful clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for men.
Just remember how many times you have told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
“I’m not too fat?”
"I need to lose at least 5 pounds - should I start doing sports?"
“Do you like me?”
Do these words not remind you of anything?
Yes to?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It’s not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase, the more poisonous women become.
Cleaning and cleaning in the first place
It is like an infinite maneuver.
Wash the windows, switch the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, dust, cut off the bathroom – and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on clean floor, to the children that they have salted the toilet, stained the living room window, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In the event that you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of Sapa
“The clothes used in the garbage.”
“Do you want to wear these socks tomorrow?”
“A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor.”
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly, you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew this, women’t have to do so much hard work.
The defamation, the defamation
Defamation, persuasion, but also insults against someone are also characteristic of some women.
Women are focused on relationships and are therefore happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Per each of us leaves away a little harmless stumbling here and there.
Hand on heart is a characteristic of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persuade, even despise others and are especially dangerous to their surroundings – especially at work in a women’s collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by participating in Philadelphia victory
Hockey striker Jagr participated twice in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again at the top of productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big evening.
"I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick."
“I felt it.”
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricane goals for the pallet and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a drop, but the beginning of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
Together with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds scored a fourth.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league, but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
“I never thought I would play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.”
“I’m really happy about that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends up with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended two against one.
"Pronger performed excellent attacks in our area."
“He tapped on the pallet, I took speed and (Read) went to the furthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got it," describes the last goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in the second third due to an injury to the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender their advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not turn any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the backline was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than losing punches because they played the match only with 5 defenders.
“It is zero.”
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
“But there’s nothing to do, it’s like that,” said Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement that wasn’t enough and we couldn’t resist.”
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits,” added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender participated in the 30th Winnipeg attack and the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered tours mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination to the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
The travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but you had to keep the queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
Even after that, it was not yet won.
The deal for currencies that was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought themselves and this custom lasts until now.
The Czech travel industry has undergone a major revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at their maximum,the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in Western neighboring countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations were making the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or pension.
The typical feature of a trip from the Czech Republic at this time was to bring with you your own food canned, sausages, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists after decades to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to the growing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 started to prepare tours with air charter connections that, thanks to contracts, have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
By the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except for the U.S., which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully rank in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including the attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but it risks ending with a situation without a solution "one pat"
The Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and there is a risk that Ivan Hasek’s successor to the head of the Czech Football Association will not be known after a general assembly to be held in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement on which voting procedure to proceed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the management of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
It was only during the post-Hasek era that football returned backward to differences between the chambers of the Association that could not agree on a common candidate.
On the 16th of September, a new president was elected.
Delegates from the General Assembly gathered unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a matter of dealing with how to elect.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only the statutes representatives or also officials with full powers.
On this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the help also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Disputes continue over the election regulations.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also made no contribution to the situation.
Opinions about the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The apple of disagreement lies in the following: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, wins in the third round the candidate who has received the most votes in percentage within the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that wins the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both houses.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentage of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to whom it would be best not to change the regulations and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also in agreement even though he considers that the election arrangement established according to the statutes is the most Pelta advantage among all candidates.
“I would like to vote in accordance with the statutes of the association.”
"So that there are not yet any surprising ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself mostly against Pelta.
Pele is optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President at Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualifying today in the European Championship should calm everyone."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more ground for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer who of the three has the largest experience in managing football both professionally and at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This could cause a blockade at the General Assembly again."
“I still hope that common sense will win,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some meetings are expected to take place directly in Montenegro but that can tell if the entire direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially hired flight on which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, were scheduled to travel to Podgorica, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee to the reprisal field.
In the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
Youth and Sports Minister Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the split parts within the country’s strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state allocation, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes on to fight for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen football leader Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have answered everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put into the campaign for this high position.
“If such a candidate exists, I will support him, I will fight for him and I will not run for him.”
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech news agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation was to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT, which a priori would be given favourite for this election.
Paclik also stressed that in case he would win the election he would hold this position as President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the position an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at this time."
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
What, it is said, annoys especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist able to influence the voting of delegates' the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is unacceptable that Pelta holds this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-end merchant, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik proclaimed.
What shocks him even more is the fact that Pelta’s name was pronounced a few years ago during a hearing in a corruption investigation, in which Pelta escaped without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the event that Paclik triumphs on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
“He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with.”
“He has great abilities.”
“He would be able to present himself, for example, as the leader of the representation.”
“But as a manager of the association he’t be able.”
"I don't put my nose into what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September attracted a lot of attention when he voted for the cancellation of the arbitration committee with Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and that he has also led since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring some culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of certain stakeholders who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," Paclik added, who does not tame his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power of lobbying high-level policies would allow more money for sport from the game tax.
"This is one of the key issues that the new president should address."
"If it's about gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be “above the parties.”
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
“That is not the ideal.”
I don’t see any reason to pass on my shares from the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the quarrels about the arrangement for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that today's success of the football representation should calm this crowd before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised to dedicate himself to national representation and obtaining financial means if he was elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President on Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily connected with the club of Jablonec, has worked a lot of years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies an euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly, statutes were approved that were not perfect as everyone noticed.”
"If there were not all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civil association that has caught all the attention of delegates.
“If I become president, I take it as a personal task and am ready to take all responsibility for it in case it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl who he recognises in terms of his legal training and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice President.
He has also not long attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has been playing football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football from competitions of the lowest level to national representation.
It should be a part of football.
“And I would also endeavour to end all the affairs that begin with that of the Bohemians or the follow-up to the corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not lead to any change of people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there has been understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he thinks delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," as Pelta said optimistically two days before the day likely to be decisive for his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT will begin to work hard
"If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected the new President of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not like a lot of people, it seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that if he is elected, we will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football in its entirety.”
“International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and youth football performance.”
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the executive committee so that each member takes care of a specific area.”
“And I’ll distribute tough missions so that football takes a big step forward.”
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said he would not be presented as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“You know about me I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and emit doubts about every one of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
“A lot of people have told me I shouldn’t give up because they’d give up too.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“There has been a lot of work in the past two years and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return to the way it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
"Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
“You can blame me for a number of things, but you can’t tolerate any of them.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it, not just those who have been chosen.
And he confirmed once again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
“And if anyone says otherwise, I’m ready to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to consider the second division being divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division."
“There would be no situation like it is now with only three moral teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech House, which has elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contract negotiations with television and on the game law.
He says, on the contrary, that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose credibility," he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
“No one can doubt that Plzen has done a great job this year.”
"If he were elected he would continue in what Hasek started and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the commissions."
"He't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue

UFO swimming pools, magnificent swimming pools of Budapest: Travellers across Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let their tired legs rest in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was one thing that shouldn’t be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marble that was waiting for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a covered pool pleased her, she promptly recorded in her notebook all the interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools were surveyed in this way by architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her previously published book: "Badefreuden (Joy of the Bath". Munich's municipal covered pools, historic bath palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She conducted her "most exceptional bathing trips in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Along with Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fan of bathing culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in sports but he feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It’s annoying that swimming enthusiasts have to just contemplate blue tiles and accommodate themselves with the whirlwind of Javel’s water as joggers breathe the charming scent of spice forests or can listen to the joyful bird whirling of the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
“So I started a collection of beautiful baths.”
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A diving in a pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more effort, swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, we have a water surface in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other side it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are presented optically in a double way: high curtains, multicolor tiles, tremplins.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it gives a desire to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Alongside splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a spa whose basins are filled with alkaline water and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) located in a bottle-shaped building.
In contrast, the open-air heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from one roof of the Zurich bath you have the whole city in your eyes, you can admire the snowed Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can watch the animation on the ski track.
Per the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaux, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel water does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emit a smell of sulfur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emits a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its lemon sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool – a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was in the meantime closed.
Looking through the red-white-yellow window of the Art Nouveau building, she observed the flowering of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only Neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder – and not only because she is native to the Black Forest.
"It's already a nice yield to merge such different building styles into such a formidable unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the spa swimming pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
The German central bank examines in detail the speculation on commodities
by Christian Teevs
Is the German bank giving up its speculation on commodities?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg –
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities is pushing prices upwards and that banks share a complicity in the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is concrete against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts, meanwhile, share the opinion that gamblers have separated themselves from offer and demand – and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from American competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, “No affair is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors should be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the bank will announce the consequences to be taken.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Speculation on rising food prices shows in a draconian way how bad today’s banks are to the general interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be obligated today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his position.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would end investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey Tuesday, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires among 1001 people.
Only eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many customers of the bank would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, as a result of the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would not recommend such a bank to their neighbors, 49 percent said they would consider terminating their account to change banking establishment.
21st House in Vienna
The flag that moved
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins.
It is now re-opened as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its vivid and bold appearances and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its lightweight and suspended steel and glass construction.
The construction is still considered to be an important milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian Universal Exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW home and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the Universal Exhibition in the Garden of Switzerland at the Southern Vienna Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and increasingly degraded.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvedere Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a hit of luck in all respects.
The new start was led by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things in her youth as an art skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she carried out especially well the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public and private sponsorship and established its exploitation.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name were exhibited there, a café and a bookstore are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht’s secession and had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was “an extremely important place” where he had seen “practically every weekend” the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and by its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was “an energy gap,” Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass façades were changed, insulating glass reinforced in fiberglass was placed and the roof replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements made room for the new exploitation, a tinted light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a protection shade against rust of red-brown color.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that were good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also pleased the office of protection monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and lightweight.
It would have been difficult with the Flag, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical story of “Drop-in-the-City.”
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and nevertheless wants to “wake up a good conscience.”
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Jardin Suisse stands precisely the newly planned "central station district", with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million in this regard this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung in advance, citing an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of a total of approximately 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in case of extreme weather.
The number of domestic and external employees for the snow removal of railway facilities and roads, among other things, is expected to double to 16,000 people.
The goal is to get rid of the snow and ice shells until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track devices needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, station manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had enormous problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is why many new regional trains have waited for years for a permit from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot to do for years, since it has to have the axes of the ICE trains checked significantly more frequently at the workshop, after an axle break took place on an ICE at the Cologne Central Station.
The German bank Deutsche Bank is paying millions of dollars in the U.S.
After the case of chief Josef Ackermann, there is something new in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the industry giant's past catches it in addition to the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison $145 million (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
Financial market regulator NCUA has accused major banks of inciting cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and drove banks down.
"We are pleased that we were able to find a solution to this issue without the parties initiating a court proceedings," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank did not recognize any fault.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and it intervenes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion-dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in the summer he assigned before the court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the question of mortgage documents is concerned, it is “Mortgage-backed Securities”.
Credit institutions are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events date back a few years, at the moment there is a storm wind blowing on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous lawsuits to obtain reparation or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for having benefited themselves in nature during mortgage deals of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank has also filed a complaint with the FHFA over a number of transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter be held accountable for "substantial losses" but without naming a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett raises $10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, is investing huge sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett has repeatedly explained not to invest in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies leaves only bad forecasts.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his mind on investing in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business gives itself the right to now be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he has bought $10.7 billion of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM had never known anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had secured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time put on profitable IT services as "exploiting accounting centers."
The IT pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consultancy as well as high-performance enterprise computers.
Buffett has so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies he understands the business of.
But Buffett, on the contrary, is attacking rail freight, lubricant manufacturers or machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a series of major groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world through smart investments.
His lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname of “Omaha’s Oracle.”
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock market.
“Big Blue,” as IBM also calls itself, has a total market value of over $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the “Cell of Zwickauer” Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology”, which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the 2000s to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish, the specter that was long believed dead has reappeared: since the Mölln bombings in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been discussed.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology", "That was the title of the appearance on the Internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors was a V-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities could be involved in the far-right bullying.
The Turkish community in Germany has reacted reasonably: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought about a ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have the effect of a blow: "Gift of Germany for the fiftyth anniversary" is the title of an article on the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also the German appearance of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of drawing out univocal conditions.
“It begins to puer” is the title of Ahmet Külahci’s book.
He stressed that people would have been murdered, paid taxes, and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived very critically on the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their searches.
Why it has not already come to the mind of the German authorities much earlier to do research in some suspicious circles of extreme right, the authors wonder.
More than one is prepared at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: “If the matter continues to be messed up, the migrants will have nothing but self-defense and weapons.”
“This is the best self-defense.”
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, to what distrust and distance through acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, sharpened our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat past mistakes
In the past it was especially the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be measured by the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report once again shows how deep the suspicion of many German-Turkish people has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake of Zurich bank scandal
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and patins from one crisis to the next.
He is now a German leader.
This is not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July that he would occupy in 2013 an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly praised, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and passed friendly observations on future colleagues.
“The UBS managed the turnaround.”
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
By September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities trader in London had hijacked all of the bank’s security systems and stolen about €1.7 billion.
UBS board chairman Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
UBS Chairman of the Board of Directors has since been seen as suffering – and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board already in May – not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and President of the bank, and he would have needed a period of adaptation.
At one point he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has proved once again that it has long earned the title of “the largest scandal bank in Europe”.
Indeed, the UBS is on the one hand huge – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been patching for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also astute, she combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of investment banking, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s largest banks.
This made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later banking professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
“In the current perspective, we ask ourselves: how could I have just been so wrong?”
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn’t turn around in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who was previously regarded as a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, I realized why he left.
The bank’s division had blown up with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this, it actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have broken their eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that one never even learned its name.
However, this was only the first blow.
In April 2008 things got worse.
The bank was again due to announce billions of dollars in losses, with the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was, given its investment mistakes, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank purchased tens of billions of problematic bonds from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken – because she noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to be home to such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We couldn’t save the UBS once again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster followed the second.
A few months earlier, UBS had already surrendered due to a tax dispute with America and said it was ready to publish data on the wealthy clientele, which had possibly scammed the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million – in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
So the UBS more or less published that it had helped tax evasion.
At the same time, it lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
Exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid to tax evasion.
And, as there was some return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of securities traders: a single securities trader flashes 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it’s published: with risk management in investment banking this still doesn’t seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, we found that risk management has changed too little,” said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
Also, the chief financial officer of a major German bank is sure: “The problem with the UBS is that it does not have the control of risks in its hands.”
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, that of becoming the guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too big risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliche of the Swiss private bank – it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditions stores as well as those at the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the National Bank through the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We enter the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank’s logo, a large label for “safe”.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another driven away from the market – or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small private Swiss bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS would have become far too big, he thinks – especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say.
“And yet they have long adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs.”
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the disaster: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash".
With up to about 68 billion francs, or €45 billion, the politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks jointly formed a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and continued to grow.
What helped is that the two different UBS predecessors completed: a wealthy but lethargic bank with as its strong point asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already heavily internationalized one.
Suddenly, international investment banks favorably gained access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very good at models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made a way to the summit with the learning of banking."
But Ospel would have relied on Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were the reality,” says Geiger.
“It was a tragic fall.”
Per tragic though.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the leaders’ meetings during which the head of the Wuffli Group always uttered the same motto: demolish Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which documented at that time the success of banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go up the top.
Some steps have already been accomplished.
In the field of currency and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
Corporate advisors, who were responsible for this, however, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has transformed into a massive machine that packaged and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages – but which also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
“Even during the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought it there,” says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when ending the attempts turned out to be harder than thought.
Jobs at UBS have become exhaustible and are so far banking.
The man who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to go so far.
But the investment bank must be vigorously atrophied, as is clear so far.
On Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be temporary when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has imposed himself: he must lead the UBS’s business sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
It will cut 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already asked himself.
He has so far only said publicly that he was going to find an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged American investors.

The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I still had last week only half-filled, not half-empty - but now the problems are pressing up again in the forefront, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: “It’s not yet clear whether Europe will be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early from his point of view to invest in bonds coming from European states and banks.

Smart cranes spread across cities
In many places, frogs are considered a “bird problem” but experts say these highly intelligent animals have not been hunted out of cities for a long time.
Some love them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible.Cornel has belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the “bird problem” is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch symposium on cornflakes, experts said it was no longer possible to chase cornflakes from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Nature-protectors also founded the problems of cities on the exodus of especially protected freezers: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, arranging and slaughtering typical coveting trees made life difficult for birds.
The crops are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 couples in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements due to the corneilla massacre in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with bats brutal.
“The normal expulsion, the eviction, is useless,” observed Leer’s city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressure water or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are moving away, large colonies are divided, and they are scattered elsewhere.”
The eviction is conceivable only in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of evicting animals to aversive conditioning and captivating offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospects “info panels instead of truncers” in order to establish completely different relationships with them: “We can finally better withstand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence.”
Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein Ascheberger-Cheming-Educative baskets, road signs informing about the life of these highly intelligent freeks.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "Here is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Freezers not only use working instruments to get to a shelf but they manufacture their own tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge recently tested four frogs to see how intelligent birds are.
In one experiment, the birds learned quickly that they had to crumble a stable with stones in order to reach a larva.
Without much training, they resolutely recognized that a stone must have some thickness and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second trial, the clever corneilles then had to solve a more intricate problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers placed a small bowl with a larva.
The birds could not reach their prey with their butt.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with which they fished the small hole of the small pipe.
Three of the four hits have been successful from the very beginning.

Mass slaughter of individuals
Peter Englund’s new book, titled “The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War,” begins with a long list of characters that touch your heart.
A tip to get started: scratch this page carefully and make it your page tag.
In this novel narrative by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a tag during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mist of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately describes as “an anti-historic work.”
It has a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is hardly any ambassador or discussion about strategies and equipment.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a “book describing what it might look like.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" summarizes the experiences in wartime of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, to doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war. Some will lose members, get mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives vacillate here like the candles of a church: while some turn off, new ones are lit up.
Peter Englund’s book differs from traditional history books.
He denies the idea that the First World War was merely the terrible war of the tranches on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully describes other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the hills; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an untouchable problem.
This book is exciting from the first page.
War has invaded the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you’re a home mother, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “The lack of facts has been aggravated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young seamen in the German offshore fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be frightening or exciting, but are most preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes “meat made from cooked rice crushed into sheep fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made from dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe socks.”
He claims that “837 permitted substitute meats are registered in sausage production.
Some stories talk about honor and courage.
One American acknowledges his own urge for savagery and says about war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, cigarette and whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a vernis is synonymous with civilization, and that there's no barbar behind your squeezed and nailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice, one hopes to have a public,” he wrote.
Unfortunately, this is rather comparable to “a convicted man strangled in secret.”
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls “a new species within the early-century bestiary: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass killer, in well-cut clothes, who performs his slaughter while sitting behind a counter.”
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid front service.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund’s prose is flexible but not ostentatory, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures how the war has “shaken out exclusively uncontrollable forces: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "Nothing New in the West" by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund’s work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming one I have ever read in a non-fiction book.
I will not reveal it.
But it's as if he came out of his book, grabbed this page with the list of people in your hands and burned it with a fireplace.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret to everyone except a few senior officers and others who had been informed from the outset that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not have been repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the department’s settlement and sparked a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police were preparing themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A major exercise was organized on Randall Island, in view of the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are being better trained against riots—anti-terrorist measures that involve rapidly moving a large number of police officers—to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
The orders given to move through the park arrived “at the last minute,” one of the officials said, referring to the operation as “a simple exercise.”
"The few policemen I know who have been called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person said.
"The only ones who know they would go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean the park but were rejected by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood – dozens of officers accustomed to criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, in the way of migrants.
“It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people,” he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and messages recorded from the speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their bright blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their stuff and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 p.m., police said, leaving time for occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the head of the police department, said the measure had been taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, severely held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the protesters' thick business hole, including luggage, plastic lawn and leaf bags filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged.The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hanged together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut off the chains.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 p.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disruption of public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, is the most qualified officer to be on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr Kelly, though present, "did not direct the operations," Browne said.
A second group of police officers were standing along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses to the north of the park, as well as Pine Street to the south.
There we saw the police widen the perimeter well beyond the Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
There were 28 people on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 p.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped onto the cover of a police car. Others were seen crushing the tyres of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of counterplaque emerged flying from the crowd.
A police officer and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
School Assistance Unions Prosecute City for Reductions
The union, which represents hundreds of school aid workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to file a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals.
The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the trade union, the Council of the 37th District, in an attempt to cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school workers, parental coordinators and other employees, among the city’s lowest-paid, lost their jobs on October 7th. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to a political revenge for not letting the city access to a health care fund run by workers’ groups, which would have helped close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the council responded, mentioning that dismissals of school grants were not specified in the budget at all.
Officials from the 37th District Council said they would fill out a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City’s Department of Education will constitute the defendant party. The complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of whom are black or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and can therefore not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of dismissals in schools in the city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no dismissals on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school allowances employees at Harlem’s 36 public school, where 68 percent of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutors say that “it’s not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill the budget gap.”
The 36 public school budget was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaint, “seventy-six parent coordinators were fired,” and “not just because of excess.”
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
It would seem that Republicans and Democrats finally reached an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the uprising in Libya.
It would have required a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi, as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democratic - Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and U.S. troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
“This is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may be harmless, but the debate about Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties have come into conflict, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the U.S. military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at cutting funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission has thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory—the Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
Congress’ indecision has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee’s resolution “blessed the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “blessed the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide lawmakers like last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is expected to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, backed by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring – the same bill proposed both to the House and the Senate – and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would “control federal spending.”
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters – the new Republicans who want to gold their CVs – the chance to boast of being “the author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August required the House and Senate to vote on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments to guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As avid as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed compared to the early 1990s, when members typically proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added – the 27th – was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," Gabrielle Giffords said in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him at a point in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrats - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television show, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said she first wanted to recover rather than return to Congress.
During her appearance on the television newspaper "20/20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show addressed his difficult return after the bullet fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing his head.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "pretty well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special show traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, with his head shaved and a wide scarring on his forehead.
She can use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A sign from the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: “What?”
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask for a change in her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated until trial.
“There were a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
“Hard, hard and hard.”
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
“So I would say, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been beaten,’” said Mark Kelly.
You have just been massacred.
And you will get out of it, recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for the homeless veterans of New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie dress stood at his feet to applaud him.
“The military, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, the organizer of the spring fundraising.
A senior military official present at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of the U.S. Army Staff, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the military senior wrote in an email.
I think the organizers had good intentions.
I know it.
It was not mercy, it was mercy.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have established between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
The soldiers are praised for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is acting more and more as if sorry for men and women in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they were faced with insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface,” Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington, said.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who gave him the interviews were subtly asking if he would be able to hold the blow under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from fighting.
“When you approach the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalls as he speaks to his sons.
The military difficulties arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely celebrated by a country so unfamiliar with the military and who sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as during World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, congratulations from politicians and people largely focus on the depth of a military’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to seize against rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could come to her room for a drink.
“It was an alarm signal,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texas has put its concerns aside.
I thought, no, he is 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I have to follow my intuition.”
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will wait with anxiety for the court’s decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a trial against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the spread of rape in the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military did not investigate, prosecute or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to struggle with the galloned military, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
“Who are the individuals in position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?”
The lawyer also says that since February she has been contacted by 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, headed by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Defense Department declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely exclusively male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, female troops are playing an increasingly important role, in connecting with local women.
Result: In these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives – two-thirds in combat.
It’s time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four leading military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogyny atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the military, focusing on the diagnoses of “personality disorders” attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave – a relatively common fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of benefits claims for individuals who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded, according to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated.In fact, according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report released in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the military were the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke’s case describe their assault as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of the rape less than an hour after the events.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a “rape kit” (literally a rape kit), and her assailant’s blood – due to a cut in her arm – was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, at a trial during which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was delivered,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions.I started screaming after the court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander, ‘It wasn’t his trial, it was mine.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and other complainants will go ahead or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, “I think they should be able to move forward.”
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrence posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavily against them... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things change only when the good people have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will gather her hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the military on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy expressing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught up in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being in cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
It is easy to connect to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t that difficult to find them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific accuracy – the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way to do research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thought groups, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study all the topics that affect health issues such as social trends, through “I like”, walled publications, and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the “data supernova” is generating an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to conduct investigations into people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should have gone to the party, but they would never have allowed you in," says Jamie Bartlett.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken feats were much more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” says Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site’s data team studied statistics on love situation and Valentine’s Day, the 2010 midterm election participation rate, and a national happiness index (thanks to the only information available – digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information otherwise than by going through the Internet, there’s a whole other thing about online.
“I don’t think a lot of users have ever thought about a researcher studying their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students’ Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks a notebook and pen is still the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and the social, it's not in front of a computer."
“Cold and Inhumane” by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” in his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he said in front of a hearing hall filled with 500 people.
“As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who took a paper speech with him, speak to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for another twelve weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind bars.
Everyone attended the hearing to see the end of the trial.
“I found it cold and inhumane,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally moved a little further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy.
The July 22 attacks, therefore, seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it's not," one of the victim's relatives said.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 Lessons from the Lost Interview with Steve Jobs in Cinema This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, some have compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing himself by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find more revealing in a recently recovered Steve Jobs interview, which will be released this week as the first part of a film on major markets, is how well that creative mind had understood product processes and workflows.
He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from a "disease leaving them to think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds".This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple.He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that major copies have disappeared in transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly upgraded, is the basis for the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired in cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions – between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
There are also moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism reappeared, where he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him elbows to get him to speed up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then follows them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a company:
“Over all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues to give details about his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed about how costs were recorded—often starting with a “standard cost” estimated in the nose, then adjusted with a “variation”—he developed an automated factory that guaranteed accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phone networks and make free long-distance phone calls.
The device has been the subject of many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you yelled at the public phone and it happened to you a minute later at the public phone next door,” Jobs said laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn’t know much, but we were able to invent a small thing that could control big things.It was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go out laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About his love for technology (and Bill Hewlett’s demeanor):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searched for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gave him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated.”
Steve Jobs later became one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for that machine.
Improvisation of Innovation:
In the interview, Steve Jobs talked about the invention of new products.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles to sell a few printed circuit cards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember big quarrels... I was screaming at them saying that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I got enough, I went out and went to see a designer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and which proved incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are falling:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had predicted how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, you’re making a better copier or a better printer, and then?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these kinds of people] end up leading and product-specialized personnel are put aside from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotted by people who cannot imagine designing a good product over a bad product – the required manual work.
That’s what happened with Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
Xerox could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s.
They brought defeat to victory.
Innovation as an Art Form:
“A lot of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
Some things you can’t do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste.It’s about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product you’re creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Health Law Opponents as Court Meet
On the day the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to examine the issue of political discord, namely whether opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the Supreme Court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a landmark for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected next March, and the outcome will likely favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision will be made.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue on the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. General Applicant during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health law.
The guests starred at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
Nothing goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would argue by the Canon 4C code, which stipulates: “A judge may attend fundraising from law-related and other organizations even though the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appearing on the agenda of such an event.”
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraising with lawyers who have cases in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disproves any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
Furthermore, Conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general applicant of the Obama administration when the first objections to the law were raised at the first-instance court level.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would do so.
Boeing orders $18 billion for aircraft
Emirates airline ordered 50 Boeing 777, two-corridor aircraft, with the possibility to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order covering 50 of its products.
It is, on the other hand, an affair when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of $18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that the Middle East airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing announced the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridor.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai that passed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, raising the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed the Dreamliners, a model that features significant fuel savings and comfort for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
“These customers in particular have immense value.”
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in fuel price – usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their highest expenses – would not be so detrimental to them as the country would make money with rising oil prices.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural risk coverage,” he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing’s dominance in the bulk aircraft market and helps to curb the attempt of competitor Airbus to engage with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautics show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the larger version of the A350, which directly rivals the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is postponing its debut to increase its push after its customers demand to increase its loading capacity and range.
Boeing’s shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister defeated in Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to gain access to the Michoacán governor's post during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favoured one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the forefront of the race for governor of this western state.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in an interview on Monday after the election.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized the polling stations, installed road barricades... and forced people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have only slightly stand out from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, who currently holds the positions of governor, came third, a painful defeat ahead of the 2012 presidential election for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the state’s capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A week before the election a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates resigned locally from the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections seem, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, “I think this victory is very encouraging for next year.”
BASD Urges Asia to Help Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the euro zone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that would hinder the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers should “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and noted that Asian financial support alongside European leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in this crisis.”
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it is not safe.”
“So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them.”
In recent months, the eurozone has been severely shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian loans has dangerously climbed and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy will go into recession, and has prompted major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would forward any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – would offer greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, Anand Sharma, said India "will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a tightening of foreign capital arrivals.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and go on holiday in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, like in the railway sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis could have “significant repercussions” across Asia.
BASD’s forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face “loss risks” due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop rescue plans" to protect themselves from economic turmoil and significant capital leaks.
Pentagon warns of potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more amount of compression is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called seizure would result in 23% cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a large reduction, applied so discreetly, would make most of our ships and construction projects impossible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously impair other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost have to send civilians on unpaid leave in order to the goal."
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect combating troops, Panetta continues.
"Al wartime funding of foreign emergency operations accounts is not directly affected by the seizure, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in basic budgets," Panetta warned.
“The contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support war.”
“The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in late payments to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Defense Ministry.
“The consequence of a seizure on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It's not a consequence we can live with, and it's not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself reached the top post of the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a shell but no core.
“This is a ship without sailors.”
“It’s a brigade without bullets.”
“It’s a fighter aircraft, with not enough trained pilots.”
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to deal with potential opponents.”
“In fact, it calls for aggression.”
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new cuts could “generate significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cut, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a key step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Discover a Lie
A look at recent headlines shows how ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, turned out to be an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violating campaign funding related to covering an extra-marital relationship.
And then, no one who has lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legionary.
There have been instances where teachers gave test answers to students in order to show themselves well on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
In a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lie to each other three times within the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone needs to acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a company game like, say, charades, where the goal is to scream: "I got you," the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research of such projects, notably in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been demystified.
The liars are looking you in the eyes.
They don’t blush, red, or stir up all the time.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A skilled lie detector can discover the truth by examining the statement structure, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I’ve spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge about cheating, and it’s clear that cheating detection is a modern skill that’s easy to learn and useful to navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled at reading others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more “self-centered” lies while women say more “other-centered” lies – usually to protect someone’s feelings – that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called “establishing data benchmarks.”
This helps provide a benchmark for measuring future changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves their feet constantly so as not to cast unfair accusations when you see them moving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for signs of verbal and non-verbal misleading behavior.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, bend toward an exit, change posture significantly, or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated soup of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson stumbled away using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Misleading individuals may also use a distant language: “I didn’t have sex with this woman... Mrs. Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of “wood tongue” when answering a difficult question: “Well... to say truth... if I remember goods... to my knowledge.”
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for lying detection, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan will be overturned after late U.S. approval threat
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico – provoking trade unions’ anger while calming environmentalists – the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada said on Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department’s announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska Dunes and Ogallala Aquifer, vast groundwater springs.
“It’s a real path forward,” Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials deny political involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a State Department decision, and expressed his support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries of Texas.
To do this, it would have to go through six countries.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to this plan are pushing for a law to force the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer away, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the Department’s inspector-general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, centered on two issues.
One is that a TransCanada-held lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was a Hillary Clinton campaign adviser in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit from fear
A family in New York claims that the Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched into a riot of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point that she vomited out of fear.
"Lady Marmalade" shocked 18-month-old Geneviève Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was last November 10 as stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hallway of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and laid her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone came behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to get her," she says.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman with anger.
“She told me in an aggressive tone: ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’ says Roseanna Monk.
“I replied, ‘What you say or think doesn’t matter to me.’
She became angry and began to use jurons—the word "" and the word "" of a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me out of the bottle water.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle threw herself onto her mom—who still held Geneviève in her arms—and had to be held back by her surroundings who drove her toward a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she started vomiting.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and the family is considering donating all the money received to a child cancer charity.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying a 18-month-old child."
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated high expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the rise is not observed, in return there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing trillion-dollar losses to the agricultural sector, limited the opportunities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the frost damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which a 78,03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21,07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year has seen an accelerated rise, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4,53 percent of the Economically Active Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand sinaloans unemployed one, up from the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by Congress-approved legislation to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars illegally it's not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and use them in something," he says.
Immigration detained
López Cervantes noted that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to work abroad, in the United States has been limited, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is worsening considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without paying a contribution as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Aside from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the state’s shift is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contracts of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 we recorded the highest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State IED reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent from the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, registered mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, the State Government in July requested the public congress approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no debt benefit was observed in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we had to align the effort of all and above all the already synchronized good running of this new Government team, hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events such as the early frosts of the year held the state’s economy back and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, among which the freezes, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that doesn't spin fast enough to generate an economic momentum that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close well below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employer Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms, we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa be exploited," he said.
A lot to do
The Chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that better channels the Government’s efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in how to manage public policy.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do,” he said.
Arrested for 8 kilos of marijuana
A person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was travelling in a white pick-up truck in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle’s luggage compartment and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s seat where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convict is still in the Crime Legal Consequences Execution Center.
Debt to contributions to works
The works of social character contemplated in programs such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes risk not to be finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programs have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation, because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end soon they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a portion," he says, "and we, in order not to register delays, we started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not pay the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the State Administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the state authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing."
The Court validates the "analogous cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has defeated the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Representatives have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogic cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was defeated for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft judgment, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the regulation in the field of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Representatives promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also decided to debute the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for them.
"I also do not consider that if he did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has as a constitutional mandate the management of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this results in better exploitation of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, “because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These questions, he stressed, “require the operation of a whole established system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompassing a group of attributions that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the State Executive.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vot per vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote per vote" is a reality with regard to this year's election process in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not homologate either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, while the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to come into effect and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided by the State Journal Act, arguing that he had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the Local Legislative Power and called the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal", as he has no right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to carry out partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no ballot minutes and counting in the file of the ballot is not with the president of the same; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the votes received in all the polling stations of the election may be carried out when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or below one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the party and/or coalition that submitted the second of the candidates.
The total counting of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the joint counting it turns out that the difference between the supposedly winning candidate and the candidate of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial counting are excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of Morelia's election, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the total 923 minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapaliname serra, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tribute and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname serra.
After receiving tribute alongside the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the guard chapel on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends visited.
At 17:30 a.m., he was presented with a tribute to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues at the Bachelor of Technology and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part as he prepared for the Bachelor.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and let his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname serra, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family a lot."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enroll at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had truck pain; but he always pursued his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, for this he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
His Last Farewell
With honors was said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute to whom headed Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the square of the group, where he was awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and teachers.
Three abandoned bodies found in Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shootings in different parts of the body and with grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place noticed that in the property, whose fence has the beige and coffee color the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with blades.
A meter away there was the body of another individual wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because no doubles were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one group of organized crime to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have connections with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the published information, in a first incident on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was rescued.
They confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 6:00 p.m., military personnel made a surveillance tour in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a registration card with two subjects on board.
By stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 a.m. one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed in its majority of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
“The framework is now well drawn,” he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy struggles with a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels unbearable.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability has placed the 10-year yield of Italian bonds BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success have been greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He will end his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was about to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 football players called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited participants took part in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convened by the two countries for today's friendly match, at 15:05 a.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, have a comprehensive record of class A inter-selection games, Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) against Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs in the English Premier League, maintain year-on-year intense activity in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience limited to one area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) matched the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the 106-year-old brainstormer of Barcelona.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other hundred-year-olds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's forward center Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol has 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least .
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest do not even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not start yet.
Spain’s historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"To go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that it will also be a dream made reality for them to perform in this country.
That’s what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
That day they will perform on the National Stadium, starting at 19:30, alongside the Los Angeles group The X and the national of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcription of which can be found in The Nation on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream made reality.
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to spend a few days there.
So it’s exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we’re sorry that it took so long for this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We gave a giant two shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, alongside Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned it, through the people who love surfing.
As you watched the tour, you offered huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the record.
What is this due to?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to play each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we loved those songs and we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes absolutely .
First, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue making music together is very emotional.
We love each other and we love to make music.
We’re lucky to go to places in the world we’ve always wanted to go to.
Things could not go better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with them all and it’s an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and that couldn’t go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time on touring because it’s easy to fall into this game of large crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He is the one who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge up, despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if that’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s a music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney now make the best music than ever.
At first his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
That’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, classified as very obscure songs, even though these can sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs probably represent that for me.
I also think that one can also be happy and even so one can make dark music.

Fujimori hospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he has in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the sentence relief for humanitarian reasons, undoubtedly, he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated four times for cancer of the tongue, he has a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in custody since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 people because of a military annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official gathering, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of various ministers and employers, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highlight of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by his ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in effect with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to postpone the implementation of tax trade agreements to get out of the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the trade of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber goes into three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the wrists of the evil Bowser, but he never did so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The game, which is coming to everyone’s stores this month, was designed from the outset to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who must tell how the stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Nintendo’s spokesman in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the video game’s presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this support", as so far hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and smooth gameplay.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to make a "second round" at the level of play, which this time is more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real-time between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and “do not succumb to optical illusions”.
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also implies the character’s return to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a glance at the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumber must scroll through platforms mined by danger to free the princess Peach.
Even if I player find some novelty in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom Approves Portillo's Extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus the trial ends for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom said his decision obeyed the independence of the judiciary and executive power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his tenure "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and that he had given rise to all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did presupposes an executive move after exhausting all judicial and constitutional instances to judge the former president from 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after settling his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolved for the misappropriation of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Prosecutor’s Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of youth without training
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter-century.
To this adds the long century of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make a balance in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the goal of helping people with low education, unemployed, with drug addiction problems or marginalized.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of Trinijove’s work.
Along with the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor of the mayor and current municipal ecosocialist adviser Ricard Goma attended the event.
Also attended in the large hall of Fabra i Coats the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the general director of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president gave Trinijove an example of how to fight bad circumstances and give hope to people in trouble.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-party, evacuated
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they illegally occupied and where they organized micro-partys that desperate neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
“From that day on, there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of that of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building her business has fallen by 80%.
The discotheque owner mentioned that the invaders of the property made her unfair competence, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had to respond to neighbors’ complaints about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the discotheque’s guests, but by the inhabitants of the busy house and especially the participants of the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the nightclub explained that the trouble was so big that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgives her" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the municipality's PP, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civism that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost every apartment and that in some apartments there have been thefts as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in property."
Yesterday too, the Mossos (local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 a.m., police moved to Rue Mont-ral 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people were entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the possibility of the call beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors once again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed Collserola’s promotional posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the grand park of Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper boundary of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that is not oriented on the north-south axis, but high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with swans in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the city council convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
The idea of a park, no doubt.
It is this, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all Barcelona architects.
It’s almost a recurring theme that two members of this former cast of elected speaks when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of the green houses, has not been completed.
"We have to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Especially because of its high accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which one must act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in the 1980s and which had in the area of the Forum "his singing of the swan".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“To limit something means to establish the next step already,” that is, to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
Holding more to the question, Modol thinks that, by simplifying, the slope of the region of El Valles de Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "should not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Furthermore, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the sapphire that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success," he says) that we have to create: "We, architects, should only be an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because the basics of the contest lack a comprehensive vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 cross-competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole."
At least in this case, he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and define with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the city council should ensure that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entire extension, an area of equipment that performs a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino Forgives Jonás Larrazábal, Will Be Released
After 72 days of interim arrest, the legal founder of Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 years in custody, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding legal authority of Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Tribunal, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
Following the attack at Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Property Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued to him after the Prosecutor’s Office detected the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta criminal centre allegedly for blackmailing with one and a half million pesos the owners of the Red Casino; but he spent only a few hours in the mid-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
Authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the District’s Second Criminal Tribunal secretary, Jorge Yánez, who said that after two months of investigation there were sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás’ guilt, such as the one relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Prosecutor’s Office officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Pursuant to the case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and subsequently no complaint can be made regarding the trial brought against him; no compensation for damages or punishment will be sought.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 a.m. the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be classified.
He will also communicate the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven others lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter struck directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the climatic conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the pale had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it meets the requirements for transporting personnel.
Furthermore, he said that the investigations conducted in the impact area did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
“In a search it was that there were no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural way.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for carrying them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For now, the secretary has assured that one priority is to get results as soon as possible; but the investigation can take a few months, it can even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and auxiliary services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and this happened on a soft ground rising.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operation cruiser at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
and visual:
According to the aviation regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
The meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border zone between DF and the state of Mexico, there were layers of low-altitude fog.
The selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew sought a lower altitude area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Localization of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was neither loss of control nor alteration of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact took place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The dispersion model of the aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected.
At the site of the accident there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above the average sea level, the ground showed a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated during his journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in an area wider than the surrounding site, around the crash, dispersed parts of the aircraft were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security leads an investigation to uncover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to uncover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the Protocol 'Genetic Obesity of Children and Adolescents' which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 20th Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social worker had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
To the investigation is invited to participate the population with or without the right, to appear at the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the tests are carried out to minors every Saturday from 8:00 pm.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After achieving the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the aim of this investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific dietary questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic measurements will be applied to all participants (it is sought to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López that this investigation is the result of health professionals’ concerns about the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls, 47 percent; in the case of overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed,” said the IMSS specialist.
He pointed out that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
He that on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American heritage, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila even says that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic changes and even pre-diabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors hand it over in writing to parents, to whom each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to implement to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another reason is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat-to-meat paste corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid crashes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Zone, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of the bitumen pavement is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing modified asphalt with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and consequently, the formation of cracks.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heaviest molecular weight, called asphaltens, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents a solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes fragile, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he noted, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it generating effort, this allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, a last layer is laid called a layer of rolling, made of fine stone, that is, of sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the bearing layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as they greatly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, water spreads inside the layer and it is difficult for it to get out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes cracks.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first to break is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated at the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle load is another important factor for cassis formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement should always be linked to vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent cassis formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to be investigated and worked on asphalt, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair the cracks easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What’s missing in being Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her number 14 title of princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico rose with the crown and the sceptre, the department has already added 14 titles of Princess and Melina to a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people are asking today is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been voted in vain Queen of Police and Best Beautiful Face of Vogue, titles obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury’s decision to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question “What was the book that marked you and why?” asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it’s a form of culturalization, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is The Little Prince, it’s a pretty deep book.
Now I read “Crime and Punishment,” it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a very beautiful book called “The Burning of Blood.”
This answer did not please, firstly because of the term “cultured” and secondly because it did not specifically explain how each book cited marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the outcome "the universe and wise, it's happening what should happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, “The Little Prince” is a great book.”
Among the hypotheses raised is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the applauded and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "this aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in her first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and her two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although in both parades she seemed confident of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the RCN channel’s “Como en casa” program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess “confirms the fact that the candidate who gets the most prizes during the contest does not receive the queen’s crown.”
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before the contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his back defects and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because it is precisely the jury that elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there were better ones, “but her abdominal fibrosis problem, which in reality wasn’t too notorious to me, left her points the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos magazine, considers that the mistake of the candidate de Valle were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle did not know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest gives out for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came up a cruel prediction that came true last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo was making to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her blinding passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
This was the work of Cali's person who identified Alfonso Cano's body
A Cali dactyloscopist has gone into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4 a Dactyloscopist of the Cali CTI went into history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the local CTI offices, this week it was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of criminal investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the woods to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much slimmer.
Fingerprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian lump, ink, a pickup and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of Fingerprint
For a dactyloscopist of Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against “Cano”, is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, with no margin of error, which can be crucial in resolving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprints support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identities of the captured people.
When captured, many criminals present fake identity cards or lack documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in one case of theft he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had pushed his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in various thefts," he remembers.
Fingerprints can also dismiss or confirm suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a man was found dead, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and indeed a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it puts him on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint scanner explained that "fingerprints from objects are extracted with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a pickup or tape is used to pick them up.
Fingerprints are subsequently sent to Asif, the declinant database, or the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers," the CTI expert said.
He explained that everything is not as shown in the CSI television program.
As not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch becomes a footprint.
However, it can be used, if the necessary confrontation is made.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large number of people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, thanks to a court order, in the place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing out in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allowed the “indignants” to camp again in the place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupe Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the 'indignant' response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation from the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the “indignants” occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists to whom they had also passed gloves.
The organization assures that there were hundreds of people who settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of members of the movement and tried to intervene in their favor before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property - remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation this morning will be analyzed.
A few displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of the court order at that time and even handed it over to the officers who oversaw the square, which caused "some small clashes," Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials struck the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupe Wall Street or enforcing "laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with tents or other properties they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city council personally defended the evacuation carried out in the dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases, to hurt other people" because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
“The evacuation this morning at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that in the end Bloomberg is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, who accused the mayor of “failing to respect freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not plan to organize "major actions" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear in the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed today images from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary while supporting in a nursery a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas program also presents the Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a fuck during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan recovers after earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends fall spiral from early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, recovering still after the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the Japanese country's worst catastrophe since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's initial estimates calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of decline, the GDP data between July and September served to turn the page permanently: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter – for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 – also represents the highest growth rate since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital spending observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted rise.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate – or rebuild – infrastructure, to use shortages to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened mainly due to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refuge values” chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and U.S. outlook turmoil, a privilege that weighs like a plate in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious downturn for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed for their low earnings between July and September on the yen.
While the markets continue to have their headquarters in the EU’s peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower the guard.
“We need to keep track of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries showed clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being curbed.
Because it dropped four decimals to 100,4 points, from 100,8 in August.
The eurozone was even below the average, which is at the level of 100, falling eight decimal points to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk bonuses triggered and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to get caught up in the maze that leads to the exit from the big European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellenic transitional government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, signaled yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period established in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, that of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the civil servants disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras no raises doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The Conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by Papandreou's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: “These are instruments for progress and hope”
The Queen stresses Spain’s “prominent” place in this type of finance
Spain “has achieved a leading place globally in the role of Microfinance.”
Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Micro-Credit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in one that aims to halve the volume of people who live with income below a dollar a day, to which the "poor threshold" is fixed.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated during the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges".
The Micro-Credit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which “two basic goals” should be pushed forward.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families that have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families get out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofia stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
She described the instrument’s father as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of fighting poverty,” whose work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experiment was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging the people present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez has warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, because it is a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez considered that micro-credit presupposes "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of compression.
For Spain, micro-credit is “one of the main lines of development cooperation.”
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to those "excluded to whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European president by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned on the agenda but was set in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who consider the government’s policy too lax toward the Greeks today and the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which they were entitled, after their speeches, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European finance minister, did not leave room for doubt.
The chief idea of the Chancellor – and of the motion – stands in a slogan: the response to the crisis “is not less of Europe but more of Europe”.
Not only because Europe is peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, "the time has come of a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU’s control of the euro area’s fiscal policies, but it could also result in the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suffrage “to give a face to Europe”.
This is, in any case, one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected with an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the ECB executive board according to the weight of each economy, which obviously reinforced the weight of Germany.
Concerned about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she also did not seek to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty prompt to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except in the hole.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is disease fraud?
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the government are launching the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less promising of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First, for the purpose of budget savings: the government is considering imposing on private workers a fourth day of shortage before taking over a work stop.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who gets sick would lose four days of salary, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks raising anger, but would bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of absence not compensated in the event of a work stop (they have not until now a period of absence, compared to three days in the private).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also resumes the topic of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work-offs.
“The checks will be much larger and, in addition, if you are caught, you will be reimbursed,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As with other cases, advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work-out fraud.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often yielded fruit.
Americans are not as sick as anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over 237 million euros of daily benefits were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of healthcare spending in 2008, with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
It accounts for 2.5% of healthcare expenditure.
In 2010, French workers had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they did not take a sick day off.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, specifies that in 2010, 37% of illness stops were of a duration of less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbors, French workers are not more prone to work stops than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) ranged, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The ill-treatment fraud represents very little compared to black work.
As for fraud, it reaches only a small scale.
Strengthening the legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 performed for short-term shutdowns were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of cases "inappropriate or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, there are 169,000 “unjustified” cases, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of fiscal deficit per year, more than the total cost of daily compensations, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will need a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to restore its economy.
This was stated by Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos in Parliament on Monday, adding that the hundred days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said, speaking his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the “main task” of the new government, as the country’s participation in the eurozone “is at stake,” he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
European Parliament rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, supported on Monday the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said during a meeting with MPs from his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and fighting waste but hostile to any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, experts say
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
On palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements for that.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is necessary, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada was ranked 10th, the study notes that “Canada’s medicalization of death has created a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death.”
Medicated or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And despite the wish that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Quebec is the country with the highest rate of deaths, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change anything to the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on people who are not competent or do not consent.
On the contrary, stated Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, in a teleconference yesterday, more cases of such overflow would be found precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
In terms ofining or stopping care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The committee also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained on the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
On palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee calls for it to be considered, when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signatories of the report "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 could ask for help in suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Me Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But “in society, he says, there are tags and constraints.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she called "manifest pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President Assad to resign
Damascus denounces a “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the foreign ministry.
Diplomatic pressures have intensified yesterday on Syria of Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a “conspiracy” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors to Syria, have taken a position in favor of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime forces have yet to be killed.
"If Bachar cared about the interests of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbor to which Turkey adopts an increasingly tough line.
The United States on its part welcomed a “strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly tough tone” in the face of the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have been killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "in exchanges of gunfire and gunfire with heavy machine guns at Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a news conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said that the country was "going toward the end of the crisis."
He also reacted vigorously to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was “a dangerous step.”
Syria “will not flip,” he added, assuring that “the Urdish plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also said he is in favor of sending U.N. observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he says is “paranoid.”
A new extraordinary League meeting is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to make a point on the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2 and including the withdrawal of armed forces from the cities plagued by the protest and the release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement its plan to get out of the crisis, while avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for some time for the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively narrow cabinet composed of technocrats outside the Parliament.
“Monti talked about an important programme with a lot of sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the appointed Council president.
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Monti’s presentation of a limited list, probably a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In “democracy, there are precise deadlines” for preparing a government and its program, he said, saying he is “certain that the markets will be patient and will understand.”
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns resumed in particular after an unexpected drop in euro area industrial production in September.
The appointed prime minister should form a team comprising mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicians" there.
The new government should last until the next parliamentary elections in 2013, he said.
Speaker of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said the new government would get the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti has pledged, once he took office, to work in the urgency and in the goal that Italy "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not its budget balance goal in 2013, despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further measures of rigour.
Italian patron Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters."
Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editors.
The big stranger will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must deposit 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist supports Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risk said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week it was “seriously concerned” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS largely drawing from IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades starting in the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He later co-operated on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA evokes "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a member state informed the Agency, worked for the most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his home country."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or improved slightly, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” Human Rights First said, adding that “the rise in anti-Muslim violence is significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered as a serious violation of human rights,” adds one of the organization’s officials, Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses,” he said, adding that this could go through improved police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hatred crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King’s death to punish violence related to race, color of skin, religion, origin and now sex.
Twitter changes platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" lets you more readily, live track the activity of other "Twittos", the users whose messages ("tweets") are followed and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they are tracking messages, whether they are subscribing to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the initiates happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were discussing the importance of this innovation in “tweets”.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” wrote @jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed,” wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austrian
Inclusion of a "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of the great social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to insert a "golden rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision after a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's creditworthiness were to be reduced by a single cranium, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more interest each year," said Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus follows a request from the eurozone summit in Brussels on October 26: the heads of state and government had then demanded that by the end of 2012 the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts be included in the constitution or in a law of equal value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP annually, while regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets at balance.
The objective is to bring the public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Yen Strong
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen continues to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of validity since 1945 against the green note.
But the yen has steadily risen since, driven by purchases from investors who see it as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was valued at around 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago as it increases the cost of the products made in Japan and reduces the value of the revenue derived from abroad by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), Noda stressed, fearing that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter by -1,5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a boost in exports and consumption in households plunged by the disaster.
But the prime minister ruled that the yen’s price did not reflect “Japan’s economic fundamentals.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” suggesting that no further monetary easing is expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuer increased its Treasury bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), raising to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of amounts it devotes to various financial securities purchases to flood the liquidity market.
The Eurozone:
Rates rise, stock markets climb
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in weakened countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock markets plunged a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt has 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With the new tensions on the borrowing yields of the eurozone countries in trouble, stock markets around the world continue to return some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7 percent, suffering in turn from renewed concerns from market participants about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of fluctuations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro zone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is valued at $1,3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing for the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish interest rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the south, but also in France, continue to fuel concerns among stakeholders.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by suffocation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is at the forefront of the markets as parliamentary elections take place on Sunday.
The spread between Germany’s and Spain’s 10-year bonds has reached a new record high.
Expecting growth figures for the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, the Insee revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth issue that worries economists the most.
Germany saw a 0.5% growth in the same period.
A first estimate for the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 p.m., as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of.
It is healthy that an election appointment is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear power in them.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic changes will result in a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will need to be tackled in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate disruption, a missing topic in the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is neither the case of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only state-of-the-art power plants.
On the contrary, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name only them, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
Berlin’s choice will result in rising electricity prices, an energy dependence aggravated by increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, and a boost in CO2 emissions driven by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
Within a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark has to be considered.
European champion of wind power, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; according to which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than the French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy constitutes a key competitiveness factor and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would result in a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest opposition in principle to this energy, polls show it.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has enabled the construction of an industrial chain of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Heavily exporting, it drives a galaxy of specialized SMEs into international markets and makes them highly job creators that cannot be relocated.
If France decided to quit nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity, nor that there is a diabolical one.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power,ining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a safety authority in France that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the reactor design and unforgivable human errors caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did with the previous two.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR is designed to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, leaving them the way to seize leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles – the encroachment of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with France’s self-proclaimed status of “country of human rights”.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming at the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, Masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot welcome all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared both on the left and on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity we are willing to give to immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande covers banality, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be payable electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p.
Restricting immigration undermines growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are at risk of replacing domestic workers, especially low-skilled workers, putting down pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes to domestic workers, exercising for the most part professions in sectors with shortages of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow job offerings.
Positive effects on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrival of immigrants have a positive effect on nationals’ salaries and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows results in an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in long-term real wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, accounting for an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will contribute a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth."
The teeth in question, serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
It is known, since Napoleon the "Little", that this was an ease of thought.
The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not its sufficient condition and can even become a “instrument of oppression” as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are living in is an economic crisis, but it is equally and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum has in this regard had a double revelatory value: that of the necessity of a powerful return from politics, but also that of the troubling feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence has to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic fighting have now shifted, and that, for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in dispersed order.
A whiteboard to the European absolute monarch or a joint leap into the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common, full-right, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal – we would no longer know where to stop the listing – because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is plunging under the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe – but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent need is to give back to popular sovereignty the steering of the European project.
Together, Europeans will be able to reduce their debt burden, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at the European level that cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy, unless, of course, they lead us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now demanding a European economic government.
to be.
But thinking so without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We need to take on a new stage in the European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson is valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe politically, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
“Contactless” smart cards are becoming widespread
The world exhibition of smart cards opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (banking card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most portable segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transportation or settle your purchases simply by approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bottles.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically spreading contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology essential for transactions.
“They were late.”
“But they should finally see a real boost next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
Banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next year in Caen.
Approximately 200 customers and employees’ iPhones will be equipped with a box that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Company, too, said yesterday that it is preparing the launch of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
Long suspected links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algeria has now “acquired certainty.”
"The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is a good cooperation," he said without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French citizens in Niger in January last year would have opened the doorsteps.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by Akmi's relatives, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their kidnappers in an operation launched by French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
The terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls focuses on several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are interested in investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we should probably wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
"It has been known for years that the sect benefits from external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this “support” has been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or its operational modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and equal to those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminati unworthy of interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which means in haoussa “Western education is a sin” – advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politizes itself and demands strict respect for the Sharia law while its militants engage in the struggle against the impious central government.
The latter are primarily targeted at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were active, multiplying attacks on police offices.
Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invades the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its northern feeds.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security specialists.
As Aqmi has invaded Mali and Niger, as al-Chebab Somali operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all intelligence".
The Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplism and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
In the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the toning statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican stronghold.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans — often unfounded — run out.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and challenge them for "manipulation of their currency", a theme carried in an America exasperated by the migration of entire branches of its industry to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if it involves triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has strangled in the face of an attitude that “flatters” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
by Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, displays an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for counteracting China’s military threat because Beijing “is trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks on Iran, says he is ready, in turn, to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president replicate that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine on anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq, on his tergiversations in Libya, thus sticking to him a label of weakness.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population views Obama’s national security assessment rather positively, which eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it is suspicious of military interventions that lead to the collapse.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It will supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brightness.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on Tuesday, on the banks of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte together turned the wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first 1.224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is to be completed at the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, or the equivalent of all French consumption.
There is also the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site is a victory.
The project was heavily contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
The issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies there.
But it’s at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, which are heavily consuming gas and whose deposits are declining.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way,” Fillon said when inaugurating the pipeline, demonstrating how much the major gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number at Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mining fields dating from World War II.
"A hundred had to be abducted or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Measures have also been taken to protect flora and fauna.
The tube is a long metal snake, weighing as much as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts throughout its length: neither valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the Swedish coast, but the project officials abandoned it as the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company establish permanently off their coasts.
"In the event of a breakdown, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders who planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, pulled by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, a meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it delivers accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
There are 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to this project.
Gazprom holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
Its headquarters is in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transmission capacity to the company for 20 renewable years.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy shore planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine is a brand book.
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
He has a smell of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine booklet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (taupe skin), which refers to a lacquered cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of book was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who became the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million units.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 booklets were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, as the notebook attracts both the businessman, student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception, now has 100 employees and has had two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center and has been able to impose her identity.
“We have followed the weather and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own booklet.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand stands on a whole range of supports.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of people with disabilities so high?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th Week for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities begins today.
Despite a voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice the average: 19%, compared to 9% for the entire population.
and discouraging?
“No,” points out Éric Blanchet, general director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people.
“The progress that has been made over the past 15 years is considerable.”
At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.
“H, there is still a lot to be done.”
Unemployed persons with disabilities have many obstacles to access employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities, compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that singularly complicate the return to employment, and that "constitute the node of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is about the objective brakes.
There are mentalities that are evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the City indicated that managers surveyed have “a low level of knowledge of disability”, with a “overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities.”
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a 1987 law.
The last known figures, dated from 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre Blanc, general director of Afif, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also translates into real awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: “Let’s be happy”
Before confronting the Blue on Tuesday evening (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match provided them.
We will not go to write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has only praise to say about him.
“I’m very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he’s Belgian.”
“I want to go ahead,” assures the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his services in the club and in the selection, "it's a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my mark.”
Defeated against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the concept of “pleasure”.
He has encouraged the Blue since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been tolerant,” he says.
This must contribute to further reinforcing the “particular” character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, “there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“We just met recently.”
"To be able to play against them is just happiness."
With goodwill, Leekens spoke of “pride.”
“I’m proud to play a game.”
“I’m also proud to see – as a “neighbor” – that France has “reverted to a very high-level team” a little over a year after Knysna’s trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a thunder job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blue direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
“You’ll see it in the next matches, including the one against France.
Portugal is confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimism his return barrage against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been at the control since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away.
But there is one match to play, and one opponent, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the match go (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score this so valuable goal, which would have relieved it.
“It’s a good result, which, however, carries some risk because we didn’t score any outside.”
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public that should be there as hot, even if the game is obviously “very tight,” said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz.
The zero by Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score and win.
One zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, which, however, carries some risk because we didn't score a goal outside," Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible from the start in order not to “give them time to think.”
This is a good idea, if you are realistic this time.
