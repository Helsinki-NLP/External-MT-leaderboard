Leave them for us.
Here's the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even though I was invited.

Who is Tom visiting?
It's Tom's fault, not Mary's.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.
He's single.
That's not what people usually say.
Ask your mother.

Tom is wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than red to live.

According to Tatoeby's guidelines, members are advised to either add sentences in their native language or translate them from a language they understand into their native language.
