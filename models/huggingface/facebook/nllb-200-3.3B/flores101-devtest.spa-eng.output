USA Gymnastics endorses the United States Olympic Committee's note and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We concur with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be more appropriately served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than with the removal of the certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can clarify how the abuse of proportion that Larry Nassa's survivors so boldly described could have gone unnoticed for so long and is willing to make any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive, and empowered environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy in an advisory capacity and, later, for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumage, an already widespread theory, it also offers specific data that fossils usually do not, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid hue on the lower part.
The discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but does have other features of feathers (pig and barbels), the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but that they were used to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the analyzed sample has features of the feathers of an adult and not a chick.
The experts' assessment was that, even though the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrated the plumage of an adult rather than that of a chick.

The community's anger led to the current efforts to draft a policy on the site's sexual content, which hosts millions of openly licensed media.
Although it was a purely theoretical work, the program was written with the aim of simulating the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would trigger the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a pulling force on our planet and causes tides.
Experts came to the conclusion that dark matter affects each other just like regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is situated around it in a halo-like form and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululand.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant was generating a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate.
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus within the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health workers from that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total TB patient group still appears to be low: 6000 out of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at any one time in South Africa.

As we can see from the infrared images, the temperature variations during the day and night indicate that these are probably caves.
During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface and, at night, higher.
"While their thermal behavior is not as regular as the large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep cavities in the ground", said Glen Cushing, of the archaeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and insert a pre-printed sheet into an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials corroborate the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the ballot and that no envelopes are added other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorized.
Candidates have the power to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process, and at night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The Director of the Attorney General's Office, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the Cabinet.
February 16 is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25 and 21 years old, respectively, were killed, the latter driving the car.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed while aimed at a fifth man's head, Schneider suffers permanent pain, can't see with one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified through a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the championship apart from the competition on Wednesday.
The first was the slalom, in which he earned a "Not Finished the First Race" as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she placed tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined running time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four seated skiers failed to complete their runs and a total of 45 participants from 117 in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, stated: We have placed five individuals who abused the Swiss woman under arrest and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the home at the time of the car's impact, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were pulling the driver of the red Audi TT from inside.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh County Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting arraignment and trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questionable, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is common practice in other parts of the UK, but because Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, told reporters that no further comments would be made at least until the auto de processi was dictated.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the boundaries in force before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics also discussed, reportedly, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to five.
During the complementary pest control test, the rangers had to closely monitor the shooters as the shooters were monitored and their effectiveness was evaluated.
In a joint venture between NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., eligible volunteers were recruited into the Sport Shooters Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage office, noted that comprehensive safety and training was provided to the four shooters selected for the shooting operation.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, he's Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that seek to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's way of responding to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the fact that elections have not been held, in some cases since 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPods with malfunctions and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company categorized as "not serious".
The ministry spoke out about the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 am local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency said there was no damage on the national territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 on the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old woman because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and entered work for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland around 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
Their study showed that the fetal pulmonary maturation of the baby could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators managed to recover the flight recorders from the black box on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of Extremo. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman".
Dustin Gold in Dust Runnings stated, "Luna was as weird as me; even, more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she's in a better place".
Since 2008, among the 1,400 respondents in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, there has been an 8% increase in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term.
34% of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen Australia will ever have.
At one end of the poll are 29% who believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end are 31% who believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He has not been able to take pain medication, because it is forbidden to use in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Many people tested the find using various types of hardware and software and in early February and it was released on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets - in particular our own - originate, since comets have crashed into the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor at the start of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration claims would shorten airline distance, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It employs satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be implemented and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to concern over possible lack of transportation, the possibility of the game being held behind closed doors, without the team's fans, was considered.
On Thursday, the magazine Science released a research reporting on the appearance of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take all kinds of shapes and roll into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it to a very thin wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and adhere to another metal, so thin that it was used to decorate hand-made illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make a pH indicator using cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron, so a hydrogen ion is the result of a proton being stripped of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with hygienic and wet hands, squeeze them to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in your hands and your outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, which connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems have been found.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, public baths were also common, and in Roman civilization, public baths had latrines, some of which were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space, because the light from Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision that we have.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet high, to be able to take a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, and the most important thing it has done for us is it has given us a much simpler and faster form of transportation.
Thanks to it, we now have many means of transportation, such as the railway or the automobile, among many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (which include independent domestic cats) that feed on smaller species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, and their life is lived in large groups called packs.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Females are usually closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions herds behave much like wolves or dogs, with whom they bear a striking similarity (unlike other big cats) in both their behavior and their highly lethal nature to their prey.
An all-round athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars, and these are the only four felines capable of making roars.
The tiger's roar is not a full-blown roar like that of the lion, but rather, like a prayer of words spoken to growls and cries.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures, and when possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all of their prey will be much smaller than their own.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey through their sense of smell, sniffing the ground they have passed.
They have excellent night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their environment and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from their main home (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back) they will often find themselves in an environment different from what they are used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations from what it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the fledgling population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to catalogue them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (exhale).
Plants generate food from the sun's energy, thanks to photosynthesis.
We build our houses from plants, and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant food, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing but others of its own species.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth embedded, plus an additional set in the palate, which meant that whatever passed in front of it, it had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a viper, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids, and it could even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would seem quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the lyre.
Another difference was that the humble people and women sat in a chair while the wealthy enjoyed sharing a banquet and sitting on the side while they ate.
It's not possible that ancient Roman recipes included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple to each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of those by holding ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to his deity.
In the midst of the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house was of no great importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just counters facing the street, houses were built with stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests; hence, the wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that he undertook further west, he discovered the island and gave it his name.
However, despite its discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes by that time.
While each country was individually "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in people, monarchs, customs and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the back of the document contains some writing, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776 written on its reverse.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that as soon as it was made, the enormous parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added as a label only.
While the landings on D-Day and subsequent fighting had liberated northern France, the southern side was still to be liberated.
Its government was in the hands of the French of Vichy, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of which a large group of people living and working together form part; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of society.
Cities are the precursors of nations, and a culture of civilization entails a long-term, generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy, and a homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to set taxes, and since it had a national executive or judicial branch, that function fell to state authorities, who often failed to cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Nor was it empowered to override tax laws or interstate tariffs.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were usually absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice jockey, jockey on skates and races d Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago, from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors sailing around recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The establishment in 1624 by the Dutch East India Company of a base in southwestern Taiwan initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the work continues today.
For example, the most common still image photography format globally is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its dimensional relationship has moved into the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its dimensions are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, the dimensional ratio of this format (divided by twelve in order to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is said to be equal to 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracia, the APS group of formats) are the same or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been constantly mocked and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing a certain order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that forms between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic church, which had amassed wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are set aside for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium, and this concentration of power and money caused many to wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the disruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such action violated widely recognized international law and contemplated in several international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain drew international waters in entire sections of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany expected to encounter a similar reaction against its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States in order to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
She arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a note of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (her manager at her last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with divided provinces. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war raged between many nobles vying for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, for instead of basing army ranks on classes, they now base them on caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people of the oppressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain of Noor (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured through time, very realistically illustrates Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
On the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave completely cut off from the rest of the planet.
It is very difficult to find, even if one were certain of its existence, because inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains around. From inside this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, erected by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of many pyramid-shaped structures of great size built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other such smaller tombs and temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.
The mark of arch upwards resembles a V and the mark of arch downwards is similar to a staple or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull this.
The upward movement of the bow produces a softer sound, whereas a downward movement is louder and sharper.
Feel free to make your own markings with pencil, but do not forget that the markings on the bow instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, her two young sons (Marie-Thérèse, aged eleven, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the king's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime for the purpose of paying off most of the expenses and interest on bonds that floated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events occur is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between the years 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily derives from the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of vehicle ownership.
The mass use of cars also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the health field to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 B.C. and extended until about 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century, its status declined, mainly because the returning crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to buckle their garments.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming that aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds originating from the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and give them the possibility to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of belonging to it by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashions, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growing up.
Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents, and in some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals and some to have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by nonhuman animals, it exhibits behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although project-based learning should facilitate and make this process more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual formats; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but so is the animated little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up, ever, in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of foster care is to cover all the needs that were not taken care of in the home from which they were taken previously.
The Internet brings together and blends the components of mass and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), personal engagement and long lasting relationships were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important findings have been made in interpreting microexpressions, which are facial movements of only a few milliseconds in duration.
Specifically, it is claimed that by properly reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can nevertheless accurately evaluate sincerity.
It even suggests that the abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; that of selection removes that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination balance the variation between one and another generation after generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources at its disposal.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious problems - stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible source of plant resources, but they're not easily digestible by primates like us, unless you cook them.
Animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily accomplished by a more or less gentle alarm clock that will bring you back to a conscious state, though without fully waking you.
In some countries, you will have to register your presence and your address of residence with the local authorities.
Other options based on the biological rhythm are to drink plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force we have, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment, the only thing that stands in the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of the Buddha, they were spread by the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of yoga of India.
In general, secularism is very simple, based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation centers on Devata Yoga, through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unblocked, chakras activated and enlightened consciousness developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend over the next 40 years and be fought in real life, through surrogate militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Because by 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army fighters from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way of moving large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has always been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were attempting to move men and material across the Atlantic Ocean in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cancel this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
For the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and hides, ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more popular shepherd.
In England, railways had been established by the 16th century.
Even though the wagon rails were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling from them to achieve greater speed and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the day.
The addition of sleepers to hold the rails in place was early, but gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were lined with iron on top.
This became a common practice, although iron caused more wear on the wagon wheels, which were made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767 solid iron rails began to be used.
The first known form of transport was walking. Humans began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedestation have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more friendly to the planet, we can join environmental movements, or we can even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, asymptomatic treatment, but if we are not looking for just a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is evident that the world has undergone great changes as a result of mankind's technological and scientific advances, and the problems have been intensified by overpopulation and extravagant living.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress president John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the Dunlap copies.
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did so in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his army in New York on 9 July.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A lot of paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today: the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed limbs, lay eggs and move about on their hind legs just like the T. Rex.
Today, almost all computers are based on the manipulation of data encoded in binary.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
The symptoms of internal poisoning, such as vomiting, are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be found with an open bottle of medication or toxic chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a highly evolved species that parasitize humans.
Killer and bed bugs are nest-builders; they are adapted to inhabit their host's nest or home.
The number of reported cases of MS in the United States is about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the junction of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of attack in multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples could choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method, which is the guiding principle of most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experimentation, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially the questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language declined, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustainingly and have a period of free cyclic operation, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they tagged the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while those occurring elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of activities that can be done in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and ecosystem information studies.
One example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they sustain it.
Now, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is not common to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the right to vote on the amendments to the Commission's proposal.
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not a simple task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to behave relatively consistently, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and to be represented mathematically approximately.
In order to more clearly plot the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design and the operations of the road devices.
The first species to take to the skies were insects, which helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, gluing them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, anisoptera and ephemeroptera are the only insects that are unable to fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite - that the solar system orbited the earth, including the sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth you don't sense their movement, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on the planet, containing eight times as much water as the next largest river.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points up to six miles wide.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they were never surpassed by those at Giza, either in size or in the sublimity of their construction technique.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then dated back over a millennium.
With about 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language spoken by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entire population of Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It had more similarity with the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals, and remember, the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals, and metals such as gold and silver have also been found.
Alloys may also exist with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metals.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively tiny that the endpoint of this sentence could contain billions of them.
So when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people type messages on their computer screens without even having to go near a notebook.
It's just a question of what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atom bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy truck up a hill, and as you split the nucleus once more, you release some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, meaning they tend to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what it is that people are attracted to or like.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers start to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be one of the guys (or girls).
Managers in this category have difficulty making decisions that offend employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and holding staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, he mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it necessary to change everything that the group has been doing so far and do it his way.
Ultimately, the ultimate responsible for the team's success and failure is the leader.
This type of behaviour often ends up alienating the leaders from the other team members.
The same standards of excellence that conventional computers handle apply to virtual ones, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their closest physical group.
They usually enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, as it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones, which, for example, may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a feature unique to virtual teams.
The 'invisible team' is the management group to which each member reports and sets the standards for each member.
What motivation might an organisation have to undergo the demanding process of establishing a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organisation, room is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organisation working in teams to overcome a difficulty will give rise to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, thus narrowing the field of research and providing greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is a contributing factor in the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the ability to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models, which further our understanding of mental processes.
While AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which is concerned with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, as well as facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military sectors, as it was incorporated into various video game and personal computer software applications.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can look at the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online in the form of a memory album.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing skills, and although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to work on improving his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "demands that students become more understanding of the world around them". The need to spark the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower learners to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, can define their own positions in the context of others' writings, as well as establish their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's captivating bilingual capital and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and present.
Niagara Falls is further south and the north is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and the expanse that follows it.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilder, almost uninhabited, lands.
To make a demographic comparison that comes as a big surprise to many, there are more African Americans than Canadians in the United States.
The location of the East African islands is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial peak of European influence and colonialism occurred in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Cape Europa with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It may also be helpful to wear a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
Be blunt in rejecting men and do not be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Menzenes used the city as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese under the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who installed their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as earthen pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of baguettes, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist spot in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the eastern border, next to Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is quite safe, any visit abroad should be considered in order to take stock of the situation of the ongoing clashes in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sighting excursions are some of the cheapest in Africa.
To get around within Goma, you can opt to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular (local) fare is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has given "Tombokito" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although Timbuktu is an impoverished city today, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at risk, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops in the Henry Louis Gates' African Wonders of the World special on PBS.
The city contrasts with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the main icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all nature reserves in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and park access.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all of the country's National Parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of the same name, which is the destination most tourists consider the main attraction.
The display of buildings that mark the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a luminous bar chart evidenced by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located opposite.
It is in the reclaimed land of the northern coast of Hong Kong that its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the region's colonial past, it's a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove chain, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site, and the section of forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Nevertheless, the forests are not just mangroves but also some of the last trees left from the towering jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about one third of its extent is covered by water or wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the station between districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is an agile and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed structure that crosses the Oyapock River, connecting the Brazilian city of Oiapoque with Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checks are expected to be completed.
The area that now constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaranis, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chachén region was home to other aboriginal groups, for example, the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished for a living.
Paraguay, formerly known as The giant province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization phase, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other lower-level tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Polo Association you will get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is set at parity with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands where you can change your money, it's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are generally accepted anywhere within the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards or US dollars are also accepted.
There are chances that credit cards will not be accepted on the outlying islands, but you could use British or American money.
It is virtually impossible to change Malvinas currency outside the archipelago, so make sure you do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive. Although temperatures below freezing are very rare, wind and moisture interact to make you feel colder than your thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many of the park's animals are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, so it is not to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals.
No matter how meek they may appear, the fact is that bison, Upas, moose, bears, and virtually all other large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year by not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; so respect their space.
Also, remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid having or cooking foods that give off a strong aroma and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbour.
They sank all the ships except one British cruiser, killing about 200 American and German personnel.
During the independence war faced by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports, the best known are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, on the Pacific Ocean, are the North Shore beaches, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sand with safe places to swim and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shade places.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in the whimsical Mission Bay and St Heliers neighbourhoods of central Auckland are unfolding in the port of Waitemata.
These are familiar beaches, sometimes very busy, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia might be considered better for transport.
The local tap water is completely safe for you to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of flat white coffee to be foreign. A small black coffee is called espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare there.
However, heed the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to safety alerts.
The cubed shrew is found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside, their primary habitat being the estuaries of rivers located north of Rockhampton.
Booking your accommodation in advance of your trip gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through them.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers to and from the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you in case you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, most of those attending musical events decide to camp on the spot and most of the spectators consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see close up action, then you'll need to arrive early at the camp to get a place near the music events.
It should be noted that while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they could continue until late in the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas, designed for family groups with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in the winter, note where the cabin is located, as crossing the ice creates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During cruises around St Petersburg, time is also spent in the city.
Casinos typically go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by their customers. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special promotions of food, drink and entertainment in order to keep guests in good spirits and inside the facilities.
Some establishments serve free spirits, though intoxication affects judgment, and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who plans to drive at high latitudes or in mountain passes should anticipate the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as it does on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, there can be such a large amount of snow that it can become trapped in a very short time.
In addition, visibility may be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice forming on car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the most memorable part for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to overland travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and standard equipment will make good vision possible.
On occasion, lions, cheetahs, and leopards may be shy, so you will have more opportunity to observe them with binoculars.
The excursion known as walking safari (also called ride among the bushes, walking safari or caminata) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. A number of events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Host of the 1964 Games, Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, complications may arise.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but since late March, coverage of a large portion of these coronavirus-based policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000 and common passes are expected to cost JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while still wet can help dry them. Many hotels have an iron and a board to lend to travelers, even if you are not in the room.
If you don't have a flat iron available, or if you don't want to use ironed stockings, you can try a hairdryer, if it were available.
Try not to let the cloth get too hot, as it may shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
Different methods are known to purify water, some more effectively targeting specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several more are needed.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if this is a concern to you, you should consider buying bottled water from a certified company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests that are not known in their region of origin.
Pests are capable of spoiling food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spreading poison, or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, by themselves, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals by the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of pests.
Duty-free purchasing provides an opportunity to purchase duty-free and excise-free products at certain locations.
Travellers visiting countries with a high tax burden can, at times, save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, the section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging driving condition and often runs through secluded and lonely terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves.
The posted speed limits are notoriously lower than on the preceding and following sections, usually 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict adherence is even more important than on any other section.
Interestingly, though, the cell signal is much better here than on many other sections of the highway like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those made in Austria, its southern neighbor.
Fruit pies are common, with apples cooked inside all year long and cherries and plums appearing in the summer.
Many German baked goods also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. In general, popular pastries make an excellent combination with a cup of strong coffee.
If you crave small but tasty pastries, try the Berliner, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe based on herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be found both "dry" and "wet", depending on the volume of liquid.
In the northern Indian and Pakistani interior villages, yogurt is commonly used in curry. In southern India and other coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly consumed.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic expression that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that are distributed throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term tends to refer to the cuisine native to the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple condiments, with predominance of Javanese favorite aromas, such as peanuts, chiles, sugar (especially Javanese coconut) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they can present safety concerns, as it is possible for their feet to get stuck in them.
If a rider is dismissed from the horse, but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal runs away.
First, most horsemen wear riding boots with a heel that has a straight and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are frames, especially English frames, with safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to detach from its structure if a dismissed rider pulls backwards.
Cochamo Valley is Chile's most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive granite walls and ridges.
Climbers from all corners of the globe are constantly delineating new paths between its walls of infinite potential.
Descending snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular disciplines that consist of sliding on skis or a board attached to the feet, on a snowy terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many adepts, sometimes called "ski lovers", who organize their vacations entirely around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings depicting skiers that date back to around 5,000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back to no later than the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Skiing: also known as rural skiing, cross-country skiing or skiing.
Although linked, in general does not imply practicing cross-country skiing or alpine style mountaineering, developed on soils of steep slope and with skis and footwear much more rigid.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, it will manage to cover slightly longer distances than if it does so on foot, but very rarely will it reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a good-weight backpack on conditioned tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling across several countries would mean having to handle visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this respect.
Generally, as long as you move within this region you will be able to cross the borders without going through a passport control post again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to handle permits for each of the Schengen countries separately, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion for determining when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit might be more narrow in places like North America than in Europe.
It may be the case that handcrafted products are classified as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics produced in series.
Reindeer husbandry is a fundamental livelihood for the Lapp and the culture related to reindeer husbandry is important for many in other professions.
Even so, even traditionally, not all Lapons have been engaged in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Lapons are engaged in modern commercial activities.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term gypsy is often given an offensive connotation, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate assessments about Roma.
If your destination country is subject to a travel alert, this could affect your medical care or travel insurance.
You may want to consult the recommendations of other governments, but they are meant for your own citizens.
For example, an American visitor to the Middle East might face different situations from a European or an Arab.
Travel warnings are just a concise summary of the political situation in another country.
The views presented are often superficial, generic and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
The term severe climate refers, in general, to any hazardous weather phenomenon that is capable of causing damage, severe social disturbance or death of people.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on the planet and there are different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, or cyclones.
Extreme regional and seasonal weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inform themselves of any extreme weather risks in the area they visit, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who is planning a trip to a country that could be branded a war zone should receive professional training.
A search of the Internet for 'Hostile zones course' will probably lead to the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the subjects discussed here in much more detail and with general practical experience.
A course typically lasts between 2 and 5 days, and includes role-playing, first aid, and even occasionally weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Passengers scheduled for sex reassignment surgery in another country should ensure that they carry valid documentation for the return journey.
Governments have varying positions on the issue of passports without gender (X) declaration or updated documents to match the name of the person with the gender with which they feel identified.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoints have become more invasive since 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their dignity and privacy intact.
Recurrents are the flow that recedes from waves breaking on shore, often on a reef or similar.
Because of the submarine topology, the return flow meets in certain deeper areas and there a fast current can originate with direction to deep waters.
Most deaths are caused by the fatigue of swimming against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you've escaped the current, swimming back won't be any more complex than usual.
Make an attempt to reach somewhere where you can't be reached again or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it might be appropriate to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning home occurs earlier than the cultural one (there is no such thing as a "honeymoon" period of happiness), takes longer to leave and can be harder.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a hard time adjusting back to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The light show and pyramidal sound are one of the most interesting things for the children in the area.
In the dark, you can see the pyramids and contemplate them in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you will be able to hear the sound of tourists and vendors at all times. The story of sound and light is like a storybook.
The sphinx appears as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and they're all illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and are claimed by several nations. They have the largest number of bases, reaching 16 active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsular territory. The largest island is Rey Jorge, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural harbor formed by the flooded caldera of an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region located in the southern part of the peninsula.
At this location, the Peninsula Mountains blend with the plateau and then resurface to form the 360 km (220 mi) Ellsworth Mountain Range, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, the Sentinel Range, are the highest peaks in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a summit at 4,892 metres (12,040 ft) on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas where cell phone coverage is limited, a satellite device may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not the same as a mobile phone, because to make a call, you have to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is commonly used in water transport, including recreational craft, as well as for expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
You can consult your local telephone service provider for more information on how to join this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option for those planning to take a sabbatical.
This is very popular among school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before college without putting their education at risk.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad programme for a sabbatical year can indeed increase the chances of gaining access to higher education once you return to your home country.
A fee is normally charged for enrollment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for sailing: the 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht on the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelago and the most extensive lakes are wide enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Boating is a nationwide recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, apart from that, it is rather unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most exclusive cruises across the Baltic Sea include a long-term stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the possibility to visit the historic city for a few whole days on your return trip, sleeping on the boat at night.
If you only disembark during excursions on board, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures list Berlin, Germany, but as shown in the map above, it is not near the sea, and a visit to Berlin is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be frightening for people of any age and location, particularly if they have never experienced the experience or have been in a traumatic situation.
There is no need to feel ashamed of it - it is no different from other types of personal fears and dislikes that afflict so many others.
For some, a little understanding of how airplanes operate and what happens during a flight may help to put behind them a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or a feeling of not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid for making fast deliveries, and time is often of the essence when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
The big companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for the smaller companies and other routes.
If you did an air freight shipment, some routes may have taken days of unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to do it faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations prohibit carrying luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first or business class on an airplane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, better yet, have your airline pay for you).
But there is a price: in general terms, you can pay up to four times the economy fare in business class and up to eleven in economy class.
It's usually silly to look for discounts on first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a basic group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and comfortably, and to be charged accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a republic composed of many ethnic groups, among which such conflicts have arisen.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which no UN member state recognizes.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic ties between the two sides of Moldova have been re-established.
Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, evolved, and crowded commercial metropolis, established around a wide bay and surrounded by mountains.
The extensive boulevards, mirror-fronted buildings and avant-garde shopping malls are dotted with traditional red tiled roofs, the 18th century marketplace and old mosques and churches, but the atmosphere is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík has excursions to the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an atypical church with an octagonal shape.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble carvings in the shape of pigeons over some of the tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour to take a stroll through the fascinating village.
To the north, within easy reach, is the romantic and dazzling city of Sintra, which gained popularity among foreigners as a result of a vivid account of its splendor by Lord Byron.
From Scotturb, the 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, you should visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Sanctuary) which is a site where there were apparitions of the Virgin Mary, famous throughout the world.
Do not forget that, basically, you are visiting a place that served as a mass grave and that is also a site of almost priceless meaning to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their stay in this place and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked there until their deaths, both Jews and non-Jews.
Give the place all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Don't ruin the place by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Approximately half of its people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, since Catalan is legally the first official language, most signs are written only in that language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other buildings.
While the usual announcements in the Metro are only shown in Catalan, unplanned interruptions are made in a wide variety of languages through an automatic program in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and conceited.
Although it's often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good time in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a bien élevé (well-educated) person, which will make it a lot easier to move around.
A few gestures of courtesy on his part will quickly make the apparently rude manners of Parisians disappear.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, has mainly beech, spruce and fir trees, and presents a vegetation between alpine and Mediterranean.
It has a wide and extraordinary range of plant communities, thanks to the variety of microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
This region is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
The European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the wild boar are some of the exotic animals, among many other common creatures, that can be found in the area.
During the visit to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and cannot wear the shoulders uncovered.
While almost all monasteries give coats to women who arrive unprepared, if you wear yours, especially if it is brightly colored, the monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
In the same vein, men are required to wear knee-cap pants.
This can also be borrowed from the clothes available upon entry, but such clothes are not washed after each person who wears them, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of other similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all its recipes.
Pa amb Oli is a popular and simple dinner, usually in the summer. It is a bread with olive oil, tomato and any other ingredients such as cheese or tuna, among others.
All nouns, as well as the vowel Sie for 'you', always have their initial capital letter, even if they are placed in the middle of the sentence.
It's a key method for differentiating between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said to simplify reading, although its writing is somewhat complex, since it is necessary to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a noun form.
Pronouncing Italian is relatively simple, since most of its words sound the same as they are written.
The c and the g are the letters you should be most careful with, since they are pronounced differently depending on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be sure to respect the difference in the pronunciation of r and rr. For example, expensive means expensive, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Thus, reading this grammar manual will help you to learn much about Persian grammar rules and to achieve a better understanding of sentences.
It is not necessary to explain that if you have a command of a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak some Spanish may be quick to conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is unnecessary to study it individually.
Today, pre-modern observatories have generally become obsolete and remain functional as museums or educational destinations.
Since, in its heyday, light pollution was not a major problem as it is today, they are often found in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most current research telescopes consist of huge structures installed in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, called hanami, has been a tradition in Japan since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where the plum blossom was the most prized.
It was the emperor of Japan who organized the first cherry tree celebrations, just for him and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
Plants look best when they're in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to pluck just one specimen.
If you collect "specimens" during a visit to a formally organized garden, you will be ejected without debate.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be and very easy to get around; moreover, you can buy almost any product from your arrival.
But because of its location in the high tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you will always have to contend with heat and, when the sky is clear, with strong sunshine, which happens less frequently.
Also, some buses head north to Hebron, which is the site where the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are said to have been buried.
You must confirm that the bus you are planning to take is going in the direction of Hebron and not just to Kyriat Arba, which is a Jewish neighborhood that is close to that place.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday theme.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, taking a cruise to interesting destinations on the Danube, or cruising the Erie Canal.
They also demarcate routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of the Christian religion, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians from both Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
It is tradition to spend the night of Easter in a candlelight somewhere exposed to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and congregations usually begin the celebrations for Christ's resurrection as soon as midnight arrives.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came to this place by swimming, flying or floating.
Because they are so far from the mainland, mammals could not reach there, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing creature in the Galápagos.
Many mammal species have been introduced to the Galapagos since man arrived on the archipelago, such as goat, equine and cattle, or rodents, dogs and cats.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter season, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Since the sky will remain dark for most of the day, it is a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights.
With the small population in these regions and the resulting lack of light pollution, you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture has a more vertical and formal structure than Westerners may be used to.
Typical business attire is the suits and coworkers call each other by their surnames or by their jobs.
Harmony in the workplace is critical, where the emphasis is on the efforts of the group rather than focusing on praise of individual accomplishments.
Workers often need to rely on their superiors for approval of their decisions and are expected to obey their instructions without question.
