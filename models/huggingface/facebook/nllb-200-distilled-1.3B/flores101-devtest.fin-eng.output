This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also revealed information not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The animal's plumage was chestnut brown above and pale or carotenoid underneath, the researchers said.
The discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed quarter called the plumage, but they had other feather characteristics  such as feathers and feathering rays , the researchers concluded that the plumage was likely a later evolutionary stage of these other characteristics.
Although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggested that the specimen came from the adult's feathered coat, not the cub's plumage.
Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers presented the specimen as coming from the adult's feathered coat, not the cub's.

The work done was at first theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team hoped to detect tidal effects between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon affects the earth, causing tides, so the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affects the dwarf galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the galaxy's dark matter surrounds it in a kind of beam atmosphere and is made up of a large number of small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally not been high-tech: voters lock themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope, marking the candidate they want.
Once the identity of the voter has been confirmed by the authorities, the voter drops the envelope on the polling station and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law has a relatively strict policy on the conduct of elections.
In 1988 the voting boxes were made transparent so that voters and observers could prove that no envelopes were in the box when the vote began and that no envelopes were added to the box other than those officially counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the event, and in the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision and following the prescribed procedures.

He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After that, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of his son.
He's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may have been tampered with because his picture has been widely published.
The practice is common elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system operates differently and the courts have held that the publication of images may be detrimental to an impartial trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists do seem to be dangerously balanced when they publish suspicious photographs and so on".
The Crown Office, the public prosecutor's office in Scotland, has made it clear to journalists that no further comment will be made on the matter, at least until the charges are brought.
According to Levy, the document refers to the border dispute, in which Palestine wants the borders to run the way they did before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, the holy city of Israel, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for 10 years from the date of the agreement, but the Palestinian Authority only allows such a presence for five years.
The rangers were to monitor closely the shooters participating in the Pest Surveillance Supplementary Experiment, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Eligible volunteers were recruited as part of a joint project between the National Park Service and the Australian Sport Shooters' Association (ASSA) and NSW as part of the ASA's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, acting director of the NPWS's Parks and Heritage Department, the four shooters selected for the first round received extensive safety and training.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Interim Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth temporary election board in four years.
A presidentially appointed delegation last month recommended the dismissal of the previous interim election board as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelli's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which occasionally turned violent, were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which were due to be held as early as 2011.
Some 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) of Japan said it was aware of 27 equipment accidents.
Last week, the department announced that Apple had reported 34 other cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the investigation "really unfortunate".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Agency said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth.
His studies showed that giving the hormone speeds up the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official investigation team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extremes, my first manager, and she passed away on the night of the second moon, a very special case, like herself, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I am... maybe more... I love her and I miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted ahead of the 2010 federal election, and the number of people who opposed becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled shared her view and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic winner was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three weightlifting events at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition has been precarious because of pain.
He has been unable to take any pain medication because it is prohibited in competition.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February on various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the earth formed, since comets struck the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year, and last month he signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political propaganda and ridiculous".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The U.S. Civil Aviation Administration claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older, ground-based technology, enabling air traffic controllers to better locate aircraft and provide pilots with accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and no terrestrial trains stop at Wembley, nor are there any parking and connecting services available at the venue.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in two generations, although the sequence was thought to last much longer, because of the crossbreeding of the native Darwin's peacock (Geospiza fortes) and the newcomer cactus chick (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped in many ways, and it can also be cut into small objects.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and twisted, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted pictures of books called "literary pictures".
This is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make a meter yourself using cabbage juice.
The color of the juice varies according to the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH of H) in the test chemical indicates the pH.
Vetions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts to the outermost layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappan and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an elaborate drainage system.
Remains of drainage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed in the same spaces at the same time.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then bounces it back almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space aboard a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket more than 100 feet long is needed.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it's ever done for us is to make it so much easier and faster.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them come the more medium-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and frogs.
Then there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, which are much larger in number.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological box, a concept that says that each cat has its own specific function, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all feline animals, and they live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one adult male and three mated males, and sometimes up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave much like wolf packs or dog packs, which are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other large cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong human.
The tiger is a member of the same family of big cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather a phrase made up of murmuring, shouting words. 
They like to eat small animals, and they will prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can catch them.
Researchers believe that oselots track and find food by sniffing the land they have passed through.
They see very well in the dark, thanks to their night vision, and they move very quietly, and they hunt by blending into their environment and then they attack the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or across a river or to a new island, so it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from what it was before.
The resources of the new environment are diverse and the competitors are diverse, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but still needs the same adaptations as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the main population over time.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations look so different from one another that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species, and speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and use carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun by contacting it, and they also like shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is from plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the great beast of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and it had an extra row of teeth in its jaw, so that nothing in its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a branched tongue, a diet of turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, something even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't have done.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own strange or unusual festival foods, such as wild boar, turkey, snails, and a rodent called the nutmouse.
The second difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, while the rich preferred to have communal banquets, where they would sit on their sides while eating their meals.
The ancient Roman diet could not serve food that was not brought to Europe until later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, called the Most Holy, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurates were built into the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, a house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, and shops were just open tables at the crossroads, with stone used as building material.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his way west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the island was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Island, you might think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776", written upside down on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that a large parchment document (its dimensions are 29 3‚ÅÑ4 inches by 24 1‚ÅÑ2 inches) was originally rolled up for preservation.
So it's likely that the label was just added as a name tag.
D-Day and the ensuing fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was under the control of Vichy France, the French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders, not fighting them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1944, code-named Operation Dragoon.
The United States and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and turned on Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil or citizen, and it's related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen or subject, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also kind of defines the size of a society.
The city-states are the predecessors of nations.Civilized culture refers to the transmission of information from one generation to another, to a long-term cultural footprint and to a high degree of diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any necessary historical evidence, so they are not usually considered true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the 13 states initially formed a weak central government, with only Congress as its sole component, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and in the absence of national executive or judicial power, it had to rely on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its laws. 
It also had no power to change tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Changing the Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, and the states were so overly critical of the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians even compete in them in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because Japan's islands are grouped together, Japan is often referred to as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan was first known in the 15th century when European sailors named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, changing the way the native population grew grain and hiring Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
After its defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Indian Temple, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been restored to give visitors a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the world's most common still image size is 35 mm, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still produced, but most importantly, it has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
A little confusingly, the 35 millimeter is actually 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this size (divided by 12 to get the simplest aspect ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family) either correspond to or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and much derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamics in an image while still maintaining some order.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the point where the vertical and horizontal lines that divide the image into thirds intersect (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power affected everyone, kings and people alike.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are meant for just such a purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question the fulfillment of the teaching.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies for soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire oceans, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the tactic only provoked a limited response, Germany expected a similar response from its unlimited submarine fleet.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations resolved to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods: Each phase of China, or each ruling dynasty, had its own dynasty.
In addition, there was a period of unstable division of provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit on the highest seat of the mighty palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences were many, including the introduction of the metric system, the transition from an autocratic to a republican state, nationalism, and the belief that the land belonged to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, the positions were also opened to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same was true of the army, because military merit was now based on ability rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of everyday life, and he often meditated in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Mount Nur, meaning light.
The very cave, which the tooth left alone, gives a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located in one of the towering mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very difficult to find even if you know it exists.
All you see is a clear, beautiful sky above and many mountains surrounding it, and from inside the cave, you see or hear very little of the earthly world.
The Giza Necropolis, located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small burial chambers, several temples, and the Great Sphinx of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward arrow looks like a V, and the downward arrow looks like a line or a square without a bottom line.
A rising bow means that you should start pointing and pushing the bow, and a falling one means that you should start at the fross (the point where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A rising bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow is stronger and more brash.
You are free to add your own notes with a pencil, but remember that the printed stop signs are in the notes for musical reasons and should generally be followed.
A mob of working women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 year old Marie-Th√©r√®se and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to Paris in carriages, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their chariot windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
The cost of the war for U.S. imperialism was borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration, which covered a considerable portion of the cost, and to provide interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of U.S. imperialism, of course, was the huge profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the background against which the organization was born.
The Age of Events is usually referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, generally thought to have ended about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas, from the so-called technological drive, or the necessity of technology, to the absolute notion that human justice is governed by scientific laws and the logic of their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond the reach of cultural and political influence, and second, that technology in turn has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
For example, one might argue that the invention of the automobile would inevitably lead to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars leads to more road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major component of Romanticism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic period, geography was seen as shaping individuals, and over time, customs and culture typical of this geographical location were formed, which, being in harmony with society, functioned better than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began about A.D. 400 and continued until about 1100.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication, Western European styles may have lagged by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of the period was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is farming that produces enough food to feed only the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses seeds native to the ecoregion in combination with rotational farming or other relatively simple ways to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel rejected by society's norms and thus are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct and distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality-related, geographical or a combination of several factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership through distinctive and symbolic behavior, including fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to use the example of the few unsuccessful children who grew up without socialisation from adults, either as a result of neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse.
Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents) and in some cases abandonment has been due to the parent's abandonment of a child with a serious mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, some said to have lived in their own nature.
If a feral child has been raised entirely by an animal other than man, he will behave (within the limits of his physical limitations) almost exactly as his host animal, for example, by showing a similar fear or indifference toward humans.
Project-based learning aims to make learning easier and more interesting.
Ladders are not a learning method but a tool to support individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be both virtual and real, so the teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the little paper interface in Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladders are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, give instructions and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to do without help.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and nurturing, but some do.
We consider the foster care system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a regular education and reliable health care.
The purpose of the children's investment is to meet all the basic needs that they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and communication between people.
The specific characteristics of the Internet imply additional dimensions for the purpose theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new influencer aspects when examining audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, or facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been claimed that correctly interpreting micro-expressions can help to identify whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still make accurate judgments about sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th century research has shown that there are two stores of genetic modification: hidden and manifest.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, selection removes it from the store of variation that has already been expressed.
Separation and recombination move variation back and forth between these two stores with each generation.
The worm, which has a digestive system similar to that of humans, has a hard time getting enough amino acids from plants available on the savannah.
In addition, the consequences of not having them are serious: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources available would have been proteins from leaves and peas, but these are hard for rodents like us to digest without cooking.
Animal foods, on the other hand, are easily digested and provide a rich source of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
So we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption means deliberately waking during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep a little later (after 10 to 60 minutes).
This is easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not awaken completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other alternatives based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or a tea known as a diuretic) before bedtime, when you have to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive his life force, and it is possible for all to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacle to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it was supplemented by the concept of the mahajana, or great path, and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the practice of awakening kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the practice of Deity Yoga, where the visualization of deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and develops the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was real, because the proxies were fighting on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers marched into the country and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navies has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains its ability to move its own people and goods while disrupting the ability of the enemy to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the United States tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to block this traffic, mostly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and wool.
Domesticated goats were usually raised in herds, roaming the hills or other pastures, often under the care of goat herders, often children or youngsters, such as the better-known shepherds, and these methods of herding are still used today.
Chariot tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they enabled horses to pull the wagons faster and with greater loads than on the more uneven roads of the Senate.
Although railroad poles were introduced early to hold the rails in place, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more effective if they were to be surmounted by an iron band.
The practice became common, but the iron consumed more of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron, and in 1767 the first all-rail railways were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus (or erect man) evolved.
The Australopithecus that preceded it did not walk upright as continuously.
Specialization in bipedalism can be found in the 4.2 to 3.9 million-year-old fossils of Australopithecus, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we should find the roots of the problems and remove them.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances and the problems have increased because of overpopulation and mankind's wasteful way of life.
After Congress approved it on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap sheets were printed.
John Nixon read the document out loud for the first time in public in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap open sheets known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look terrifying.
They have legs with gills and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers  or bits in computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most obvious sign of indoor poisoning is a visible, open medicine can or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the first aid instructions on the label for the poison in question.
Entomologists use the term lute to refer to this particular group of insects.
The term is derived from the fact that in ancient times, leeches were very common, leeches are insects that are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predators and larvae are nest-dwelling, adapted to life in the nest or enclosure of their host.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or those of their children.
If they wish, these couples can draw up a plan for adopting their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing the other couple to act as the child's parent.
The main task of science is to find out, by scientific methods, how the world works.
However, it is not just about doing experiments, and a test is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters were accepted, including psychology.
As Greek became less well-known in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in body structure and behavior often depend very substantially on the existence of innate cycles and their creation by means of biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate freely for a period of time in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase study was one of the most important clues to the fact that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, either by marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the gene they affect, and whether they affect the genome or other cells.
Only mutations in the genome can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the scenery  including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities in the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and learning about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, learning about, and photographing the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people in small rural towns drive to work, and they are met by others who have jobs where they left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the private car transport system.
Science now indicates that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system.
In developed lands, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard as often.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because one cannot predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave relatively uniformly, so traffic flows are usually fairly consistent and can be represented in a rough mathematical way.
To better describe the flow of traffic, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships will help in the design, design and maintenance of data.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their bodies.
This gives them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the wolf-billed wren and the day-billed wren are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, and it holds more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at six miles at its widest.
The full 20 percent of our planet's water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or skill of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were already well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the world's smallest independent state and the world's smallest country by population.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the people working in the government also speak Italian as their everyday language, but Latin is often used in religious services.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican State are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about common chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times because they all occur in nature in their own right and are also relatively easy to extract with basic tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter  in the same order solid, liquid, gas and plasma  but he also theorized that they transform into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that they would fit into the final point of this sentence by the billions.
Thus, many people found lead a good friend when it came on the market.
Sadly, as new writing methods have developed, the value and use of the pencil has been more neglected.
Nowadays, messages are typed on a computer screen and never need to be sharpened.
You can only guess what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The physiobomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus made up of many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy back out.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which makes them prone to decay from little or no thrust.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The moon's crust is about 45 miles [70 km] thick on the Earth's visible side and about 60 miles [100 km] on the Moon's far side.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
The dark areas of the ocean may be more visible because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are primarily concerned with what is behind or what attracts people to their behavior.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular theories of content.
When leaders start to lead their former peers, two general patterns of behavior can form: at the other end of the scale, the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or "the dudes").
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, maintaining discipline, evaluating performance, sharing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, the individual is shaped into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to be of the same quality as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
The virtual team members act as liaison with their immediate physical team.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones and their local authority may not always understand this.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which all members report, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process required to set up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used efficiently in all the functional departments of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be generated.
As a result, a process where an organisation works together to overcome the barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, managers must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to help organisations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, which narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies makes it possible to see and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
Although AI is thought to be strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research is an attempt to make machines perform tasks that require intelligence automatically.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and hand, voice and face recognition.
These have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, artificial intelligence is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense, just as it is built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Class trips are an important part of the education, and often the teacher would like to take the students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution: virtual classroom tours, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art from a desk.
Sharing a class trip virtually is a great way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year at Bennett School in North Carolina, students plan a website for their trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online as a kind of clipbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of a student's blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often neglected, but the presence of an audience usually changes things.
Since students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to struggle to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
The need to nurture the interest of readers inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical, and by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings and bring their own perspective to the question at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital city, with a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoilt, natural beauty of Muskoka.
These and many other factors make Ontario seem to outsiders to be a Canadian icon.
Large areas in the north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The following demographic comparison may surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of them, and its nature is like that of its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France and are known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it gained a lot of traction in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The territory is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women  All female travellers, regardless of actual civil status, are recommended to say they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause what they may perceive as harassment, such as someone following behind, grabbing your arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to take sides (cultural differences do not justify courtship!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port, which they called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-ul-Badya, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
The old medina is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, water pipes, and a wide variety of scraps, but all of them are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but any excursions outside the city require preliminary investigations to determine the current status of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also home to some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking equipment in Africa.
To get around in Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
This, coupled with its relatively difficult location, has led to "Timbuktu" being used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination and has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 1990 because of the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 nature reserves, each supporting a different fauna and flora.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a daily protection and entrance fee, as in all South African national parks.
It may also be helpful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows access to either some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong area and is a major tourist destination.
The building patterns that make up Hong Kong's skyline have been compared to the glittering column pattern best seen in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best parts of Hong Kong are to leave the island and head for the Kowloon harbor area across the street.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on the densely built-up land of the north shore.
This is the very place that the British colonialists took over, and if you're looking for clues to the area's colonial history, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching for 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest on the Indian side is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangroves. They include some of the last remnants of the majestic forests that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 2,800 square miles [3,850 sq km], about a third of which is covered by water or saline areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Indian tigers and some 30,000 deer.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakarta and Bumthang, depart between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m.
Since buses within the area are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the counties are served by small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and supportive.
The trip taxi is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paroon (150 knots) and Punakha (200 knots).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two strips of 3.5 meters.
The bridge has a clearance height of 15 metres and construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the border stations in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important of the indigenous groups in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-pastoral hunters but also as subsistence farmers.
Other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycur√∫ and the Payagu√°, lived in the Chaco region and supported themselves by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, once called "the land of the giants of the Indies", was born of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples of the land in the 16th century.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three hundred years.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Las Ca√±itas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen in other seasons.
The Argentine Polo Association will be updating you on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands that can change money is the one in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
Pounds are the main currency throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also frequently used in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be valid in the outer islands, although UK and US currencies may be acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so change your money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer while the northern hemisphere has winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures in the mid-30's are common during the summer months.
Winter can be a treacherous ordeal: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer readings.
There are no special rainy seasons and no dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals have become accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from other wildlife.
Bison, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack, even though they may appear to be quite tame.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
You also know that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing in or preparing strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships  German, American and British  refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealof III.
There are many sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two ports, and the most popular are in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the borough of North Harbour) are on the Pacific coast and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the port of Waitemata in the affluent Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs of central Auckland.
They are sometimes busy family resorts, and the coastline is lined with a good selection of shops.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a multi-dimensional beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are several French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may hold up better on the road.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find for the careful.
The idea of flat white milk coffee is foreign to Australians, whereas small black coffee is known as espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of cream instead of skimmed milk.
The cocoa is Belgian, the juice is expensive, but it's excellent.
The reef is a popular year-round destination for hikers, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
So heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cubic medusa is found north of the 1770 near beaches and riverbanks from October to April, and occasionally at other times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will probably swim away.
The crocodiles do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is the river swamps north of Rockhampton.
When you book in advance, you will have the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive.
Travel agencies often have offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
However, all changes and requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp in the area, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to get there early to get some music near the campsite.
Remember that even after the main stage musical performances have ended, there may be venues at festivals where music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have separate campgrounds for families with children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of your cabin, since the noise from passing through the ice is very terrible in the worst parts.
The cruise ship is subject to a visa waiver (see conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize time and money spent by customers, and windows and clocks are usually absent, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood  and in the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or in the mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very cold temperatures.
Ice and snow roads have little friction and you cannot drive the way you would on asphalt.
During a blizzard, snow can fall in a very short time, so much that the car gets stuck.
Snowfall or windswept snow, and moisture or ice accumulated in the vehicle's windows may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic generally runs year-round without interruption.
Safari is perhaps Africa's greatest attraction and a highlight for many.
The word safari is used to refer to a road trip to see the magnificent wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and ordinary equipment is quite sufficient to observe them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, hiking safari, and hiking) is a trip that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation practices vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellation practices did not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were due to be held.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost 2,500130,000 yen, with tickets usually costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry out, and many hotels offer ironing irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you are not particularly fond of ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as this may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are a variety of methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poison, and spread disease.
Real infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means the possibility of buying products exempt from excise and sales taxes in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries may sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging on the Buffalo/Pittsburgh motorway, as it repeatedly runs through remote woodland.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on guard: there are many steep climbs and descents, narrow lanes and steep turns.
The speed limits are considerably lower than in the earlier and later periods  generally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, cell phone coverage is much better here than many other places along the way, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and Bavarian pastries are quite varied and varied, reminiscent of those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, apple cakes are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular summer fillings.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you crave small but firm pastries, try one called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapf, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the peninsula, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a staple that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures throughout the country.
But when used without further definition, it usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Java cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, and it includes a wide range of simply spiced dishes, including the flavours of peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Java coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The footrests are the rider's footpaths that hang on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but they may also present safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but his leg is caught in the footrest, the running horse may pull him over.
First, most riders wear high-heeled boots with a smooth, rather narrow bottom.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety harness that loosens the harness if a falling rider pulls it back.
Cocham√≥n Valley  Chile's number one climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its wide variety of granite walls and cliffs.
From the summits, breathtaking views are seen, and climbers from around the world continually forge new routes to its endless walls.
Skating and snowboarding are popular sports in which snow is lowered from the ground with a snow shoe or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many skiers, sometimes called "ski-pums", plan entire vacations at a particular destination around skiing.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski center in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also known as desert skiing, skiing in the open or skiing on the go.
It is related to alpine-style hiking or mountaineering, but it is not usually included, since the latter is done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer socks and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can go a little faster than on foot, but you will rarely reach the speed of skiing with well-groomed skis and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries, and under normal circumstances travelling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and passing through passport controls many times.
However, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a single state in this respect.
As long as you are in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what factory-made goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as anything over a hundred years old.
The definition varies by geographical location, for example, in North America, antiquities are considered to be more recent than in Europe. 
Handmade goods may be classified as antiques even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important occupation for the Sami people, and the culture associated with it is also important for many other professionals.
Even so, traditionally not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but have lived off fishing, hunting and similar livelihoods and have kept reindeer as their main livelihood. 
Today, many Sami people work in modern trades, and tourism is an important source of income in the country.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romani people.

Hazardous weather is a generic term for all dangerous weather events that may cause damage, serious social disturbance or loss of life.
Hazardous weather can occur anywhere in the world and can be of different types depending on geography, surface formations and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, heavy rain, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, hurricanes, waterfalls, and cyclones.
The regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of dangerous weather affecting the destination as it may affect travel plans.
All those who wish to visit a country that could be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely yield the address of a local business.

The course usually lasts two to five days, and includes role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on desert survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to have sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have proper documentation for the return journey.
The willingness of the authorities to issue passports without an X or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies equally.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not had surgery should not be expected to survive security scans while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
The return currents are the return of waves that break into the shore, often on reefs or similar places.
Because of the underwater surface, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas, where a rapid deep-water flow can form.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you will not be swept away again, or depending on your skills and whether you are noticed, it may be wise to wait for rescuers.
Recurrent shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the acclimatisation phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who were able to adjust easily to a new culture may find it especially difficult to adjust to their own culture.
When you return home from living abroad, you have adjusted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the area's most interesting activities for children.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the show begins, they can be seen in complete silence.

The Sphinx is the backdrop to a long story and its narrators.
Scenes are shown against the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by many nations and have the most active bases, with 16 in 2020.

Ellsworth Land is an area bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea in the south of the peninsula.
There the Neman mountains merge into the plain and then rise again to form the 200-mile-long (360 km) Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota glacier.
In the north, the Sentinel Mountains, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its highest peak at 15,430 feet [4,892 m].
In remote areas where mobile phones do not have reception, satellite phones may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a cell phone because to make a call you have to be outside and have unobstructed satellite visibility.

Finland is an excellent destination for boating, and the land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and on the coastal archipelago.
On islands and lakes, you may not need a boat the size of a bite.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where boats are used for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most real Baltic cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return to the ship for the night.
You do not need a separate visa if you are only visiting the country on a boat tour (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced something traumatic.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fears and disgust many other people have about certain things.
For some, some understanding of the operation of an airplane and what happens during flight may help to overcome fear of ignorance or helplessness.
Transport companies are well paid for fast deliveries, often very important for business documents, merchandise or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own planes on some routes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent goods by air freight, some routes could take days to unload and clear.
The only way to get the baggage through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, so at this point, we need you.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a big bill for this privilege (or perhaps rather let your company do it for you).
But it will not come cheap: By a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of business class and 11 times the price of first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it is generally not worthwhile to even look for discounts on business or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of air travelers who are willing to pay a premium to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi≈üinƒÉu, and the local language is Romani, although Russian is also widely spoken.

Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, although political negotiations have failed.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
ƒ∞zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.

The rude exterior of Parisians will quickly fade if you show a mere courtesy.
Plitvice National Park is heavily forested, with a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation, mainly beech, fir and pine.

In addition to the more common species, rare animals can be found, including bears, wolves, eagles, owls, falcons, wildcats, and honey bees
Women visiting monasteries are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, and shoulders are also to be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a bright one, you may get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to wear trousers that reach below the knee.
You can borrow them from the entryway wardrobe, but they don't wash after every use, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like similar Mediterranean cuisines, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes and any available additives, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, and also the word "you", always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

Most modern research telescopes are huge installations, located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese cypress.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom festivals exclusively for himself and other members of the influential aristocracy of the imperial court.

Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have also been adopted by non-believers and non-Christians around the world in Christian lands.
Traditionally, Easter is celebrated by waking up in an open area to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Mass on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, often breaking up at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the island came by swimming, flying or hovering.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, the mammals could not survive the journey, and the giant tortoise became the main herbivore of the Galapagos Islands.
