When an English speaker feels that a foreigner with whom he is speaking does not understand something he is saying, he repeats exactly the same thing, but louder, as if the person were deaf. At no point does he realize that his choice of words might be difficult, or that his pronunciation might be easily understood by a foreigner, and that he could say it more simply in other words. As a result, the person not only continues to misunderstand, but also becomes irritated by being considered deaf.
