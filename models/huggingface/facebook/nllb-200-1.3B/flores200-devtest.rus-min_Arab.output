When a small group of living organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or, if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), then they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from what it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all they still need the same adaptations as before.

It says that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).


Her all-pervading power touched everyone from the king to the common man.

The center of church power has been Rome for over a thousand years, and such concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this dogma is being upheld.

This strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated universally accepted international laws, as outlined in several international agreements over the last two hundred years.
UK mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unhindered underwater warfare.

After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America, and accepted an offer to work for Edison in New York City.
He came to the US with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his boss at his previous job, to Thomas Edison.

The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
also after the revolution, jobs opened up for all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true for the military, because ranks are now based on qualities rather than on origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class representatives in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in non-religious topics. He often visited the cave which became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) for meditation.
The cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid insight into Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's very hard to detect even for someone who knows it exists. In a cave, a person finds himself in complete isolation.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of the wives of Cheops and his relatives.

"Up" means you should start at the tip and take the knot forward, and "down" means you should start where your hand holds the knot and take it back.
The upward movement of the joint usually produces a softer sound, while the downward movement of the joint is stronger and more forceful.
You can draw your own lines, but remember that the lines are printed for musical reasons, and they usually follow.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of angry women from the market forced back to Paris from Versailles the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antuanne, their two little children (11 year old Marie-Therese and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd who shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military expenses of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for most of the expenses and interest on the bond loans transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.

To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led them to create the Order.

The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the later Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted viewpoint, ended around 1500
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destinies are driven by a fundamental logic, related to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.

You could say, for example, that the car is the inevitable cause of the development of roads.

Car ownership is also driving an increase in road accidents, which is leading to new treatments for injuries.
Romantism included cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.


The fame of it as a center of luxury started around 400 CE and lasted till about 1100 CE.

A natural agriculture is a farming that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, system of farming, using seeds of plants growing in a given ecosystem, along with the use of seed rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in farming for food, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel marginalized by society's standards, and allows such people to define themselves.


representatives of a particular subculture often declare their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, including through fashion, manners and jargon.

Some of these children have been isolated by people (usually their own parents), and in some cases, this rejection of their child is the result of their parents not accepting their child's serious intellectual or physical shortcomings.

Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is completely raised by animals instead of humans, the wild child demonstrates behaviors (within physical limitations), in almost everything similar to the particular animal that raised him for example, his fear or indifference to people.
Though project-based learning should be easier and more fun, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
It's not a learning method, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.

Virtual learning aids are built-in software designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that might be too difficult for the learner to handle alone.


We think the foster care system is safe for kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.

Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication. Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
It is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contacts" were also named by Amy and McCord (1998) as new facets of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions facial movements of several milliseconds.

Other options that are based on biological rhythms include taking large amounts of fluid (in particular, water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present in you. Each person is given the potential to find absolute peace and a sense of satisfaction.

Tibet Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple. They consist of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The heart of Tibetan meditation is considered to be the Yoga of the Divine. Through visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are triggered and enlightenment of the mind is achieved.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war ended, the contradictions regarding the system, process and culture led to a dispute between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years, and it was going to be a real war, with proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places around the world.


The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.

one of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II where the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.

Goats were probably first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Iranian Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to leave them to themselves to have milk, wool, meat and leather at their fingertips.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing places, often overseen by goat herds, which were usually children or teenagers, which is similar to the more common activity of a shepherd.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the gauge roads were only parallel bars of wood, they gave horses the opportunity to carry larger loads and at a higher speed than on the slightly more bumpy roads of the time.

This became common practice, but iron led to more wear on wooden wagon wheels.
Through the years, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known form of transport was by foot, people started walking straight two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning straight man).
For their ancestors, Australopithecus, walking upright was not as common.
3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelantropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.

The term "buck" is used by entomologists formally to denote a group of insects.
The term "bed bug" comes from bed bugs, which are insects that have been known since ancient times and are perfectly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
United States has approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making MS the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged people.
OCD is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that twice as many women as men suffer from multiple sclerosis.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world is organized by applying the scientific method. This method is actually the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment  is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), by asking questions and by observing.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused their attention on ancient texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.

As the knowledge of the Greek language deteriorated, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by means of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply a response to external periodic stimuli, are recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle autonomously for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments, marking DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus and radioactive phage protein with gray.
Mutations can cause a lot of different results, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to the children, whereas mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.

Activity activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.

Everyday morning people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their workplace, and pass them by those whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this active transport movement, everyone is somehow connected to the transport system, which is based on personal cars, and they support it.
science now indicates that the huge hydrocarbon economy has influenced one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.

In developed countries, you rarely hear these kinds of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transport systems get so many complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers just incompetent? Or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of transport flows.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of traffic because you can't predict the behavior of the driver with 100% probability.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour is often quite systematic; thus, transport flows in general have some systematicity and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent the transport flow, relationships were established between three basic quantities: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to elude enemies, find food, and find mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their body, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
Strucos and pterodactyls are the only insects that can't fold their wings back.

The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to get a lot of protons and neutrons in one nucleus.
like pulling a heavy cart up a hill, where the nuclear fission releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to break down with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km  under the continents.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the hills.
On the visible side there may be more seas on the moon because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
