Last minute: Our cosmic visitor is the giant asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions, perhaps more, of giant asteroids in the solar system that are loose and could have serious consequences if they hit.
These objects, which may have closed or open orbits left over from the formation of the Sun, sometimes pass through Earth.
The 650-meter-wide asteroid 2014 JO25 is one such visitor and will pass 1.75 million kilometers from its closest point to Earth today at 2:24 p.m.
We're hearing more and more of this kind of news every day.
This is mainly due to the advances in observation techniques and instruments.
This allows us to identify smaller asteroids that have not been identified before.
For example, last January, an asteroid the size of a bus passed within about half the distance of the Earth and the Moon.
And even more interesting, the asteroid was detected just days before the transit.
So there could be other space buses coming our way right now.
Imagine if you were told that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter was going to hit the middle of your neighborhood.
Well, asteroids this size won't actually destroy your neighborhood, but they'll probably blow up the windows of all the buildings.
This will be due to the shock waves from the asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013, an asteroid that hit Russia was this big and it was able to smash windows in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood targeted by an asteroid 100 meters in diameter, I recommend that you go at least 30 miles away from your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact determine the depth of the impact crater and the damage caused by the impact.
Let's look at a few scenarios from the European Space Agency's simulation.
If an asteroid 100 meters in diameter were to hit the Earth at a 45-degree angle, at 60 kilometers per second, it would form a crater about 250 meters deep and 1,200 meters wide.
The impact is equivalent to a six-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, and even if you're 10 kilometers from the point of impact, you'll still get a third-degree burn.
And the others, 30 miles away, will be waiting for the shattered windows.
If an asteroid a mile across hits it, it's even more depressing.
If an asteroid of this size, with the same angle and velocity, were to hit Earth, it would form a crater about 2,000 feet deep and seven miles across.
So a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears instantly.
The heat from the impact will cause a third-degree burn to your body even if you're 60 miles away from the point of impact.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale.
The damage from the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid but also on the rock structure of the area it will hit.
The above values are based on a scenario in which a hard rock-like asteroid crashes into a region of bulky rock.
If the asteroid is mostly iron, and it hits a surface that's formed by the cooling of lava, the crater will triple in size, and the resulting catastrophe will be doubled.
66 million years ago, something even worse happened to the dinosaurs, and they were devastated by an asteroid about 10 kilometers across.
The asteroid impact instantly wiped out 75% of all marine and terrestrial life.
If an asteroid this large to wipe out the dinosaurs were to hit Earth, the safest option would be to leave.
Tons of matter falling on Earth from space every day.
Most of it burns up in the atmosphere.
Some meteorites that are large enough burn up in the atmosphere, causing what is known among the public as starbursts.
Let's finish with another heartwarming story.
Studies show that an asteroid so massive that it would cause serious destruction is not expected to hit Earth for the next 300 to 400 years.
As creatures who live an average of 70 years, I'm sure you're a little relieved.
The big claim for the medal: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who is the black-and-white name on the agenda for the Inter, who wants to reinforce the stop area...
The 30-year-old, who took a break after wearing the Chilean shirt in the Confederations Cup and recently started working with Inter again, is waiting for offers.
Gazzetta dello Sport, a prestigious Italian newspaper, suggested that Beşiktaş made Inter an offer of 10 million euros for Medel, who can play both the stoper and the front libero.
The black and white people who made the offer to Medel are waiting for a response from both sides, while the Chilean footballer is looking forward to living in Istanbul with his family.
Despite the Gazetta's claim, it is very difficult for the Black Eagle, which is limited by the FFP, to pay a price of 10 million euros for the Medal.
Black and White are likely to move to Medel first, as they did in Caner Erkin's transfer, or if they get a serious discount on their bonservice, they can add the star player.
Beşiktaş reported Negredo's transfer to the stock exchange
Human rights group issued a travel advisory for Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a travel advisory for people of color to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The State of Missouri NAACP Travel Advisory Notice, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise special caution and exercise extreme caution when traveling across the state as noted therein due to recent suspicious, racially based incidents occurring throughout the state".
The NAACP said a new Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, but that the state's law enforcement's disproportionate targeting of minorities was also effective in the group's issuance of this travel warning.
"There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They're being stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin", Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We're hearing complaints at a rate we've never heard before".
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited racist slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was detained by Missouri police earlier this year after running out of fuel while crossing the state, uncharged, and died under suspicious circumstances.
The advisory also points to a new report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that shows black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
Chapel said the advisory is "to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri".
"People should be prepared to bring bail money with them, "to inform their relatives that they are going to pass through this state".
In Missouri, the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program show that 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, which puts the state 16th in the nation in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a business for discrimination when renting or hiring.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) previously issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration enforcement laws that ordered local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU says will increase enforcement based on race.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba is in Bishkek.
Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros two seasons ago and was hired by the Black and Whites in the middle of last season, is returning to Beşiktaş for free.
The Black Eagle, which asked the Senegalese player for a detailed health report last week, acted on a report from the star footballer.
The Black and White management, who started working on the 32-year-old player, who the Chinese representative did not think would be in the squad next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not added to list
Demba Ba, who is not listed because of his foreign status in China, has informed the administration that he wants to return to the Black-White.
The Chinese team has approved the 32-year-old's departure.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days to sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated on in Trabzonspor.
In a statement posted on the club's website, Castillo underwent arthroscopic meniscus surgery on his left knee at Liv Hospital in Istanbul, and said, "It is anticipated that after the operation performed by Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar, our player will start training with the team in 4 weeks".
Castillo was injured in the right back leg during the training match of the maroon-blue team against Dutch team Heerenveen in the Slovakian camp.
The Colombian player, who was told he would be out of the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to undergo surgery due to a previous problem with his meniscus.
The referendum out of Barzan!
Barzani made a speech at the commemoration ceremony in Duhok on the 3rd anniversary of the attack on the Yazidi population in the Sinjar district of Mosul by the terrorist organization Daesh.
In his speech, referring to the referendum on independence that the IKBY wants to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I have to say with regret, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and proper country".
We tried everything with Iraq, but we were completely helpless and hopeless.
Our past experiences with Iraq have put us in this position, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to get our rights and be protected.
So, together, to ensure life and security, we must show the world that we can all decide our destiny through a referendum.
I must stress that the referendum is not an end in itself, but a means to a greater end.
Barzani recalled that after the Baath regime was overthrown in 2003, the central government of Iraq made many promises to the Kurds.
Barzani said that the people of the IKBY want to determine their fate peacefully and democratically to protect themselves and develop.
"He doesn't want us to move forward", he said.
Barzani noted that during the fight against the terrorist organization Daesh, the central government of Iraq did not provide them with weapons, but that the Hashdi Shabi, which was established with a fatwa in a short time, was immediately legalized and all weapons were provided:
Within the Iraqi defense system, the Peshmerga were not contacted.
The central government did not do to the Peshmerga what it did to Hashd Shabi.
The Peshmerga are constitutionally considered part of Iraq's defense system.
But when Hashdi Shabi had no constitutional presence, all the possibilities were mobilized, violating the laws.
We're not saying we're against Hasdi Shabi.
The Peshmerga and Hashdish Shabi fought on the same front, so why is it that on the one hand, Hashdish Shabi is legalized, while the existence of the Peshmerga and its fight against terrorism is covered up?
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
The terrorist organization DEAŞ attacked Yazidi residents of Sinjar district of Mosul on August 3, 2014, killing many people, including women and children.
He came back from the accident in 10 minutes.
According to a BBC report, a Boeing 777 passenger plane belonging to Air France was in the air west of Hokkaido in northern Japan while a North Korean missile was in the air.
Officials said the missile was estimated to have approached the plane within 100 to 150 kilometers.
Air France said the missile did not cross the flight path and that there was no problem on the flight.
"At this stage, the information we have indicates that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers from the plane's course", the statement said.
Nothing is sacred, is it?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change is that they're attacking the statues.
The Americans know as well as anyone the value of this, as the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003...
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, knew exactly what the president was doing when he symbolically destroyed the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta over his proposals to severely restrict legal immigration.
In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a bunch of boat tour owners and Freedom impersonators would lynch him.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, when Emma Lazarus' famous poem was added to the base of the monument.
Miller, speaking to Acosta, said, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a beacon of American freedom to the world.
The poem you're referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller's actually right, but as he says, it's not really about the date.
This is about the contemporary echo of Lazarus's chilling words, only in which a state seems to invite not only some elderly immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Tired, poor, / crowded masses longing to breathe freedom, / crowded, wretched unwanted of the land".
Never before has the "unwanted" been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't making a literary criticism; he was explaining that these people were not welcome in the United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a larger political and cultural battle: It's actually a conflict over what it means to be an American.
Lazarus and his friends, who campaigned after his death to have his words placed at the base of the statue, knew full well that they were engaging in a highly political action.
The statue was intended to celebrate the links between French and American republicanism by embodying a metaphor, the coming of Liberty in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed this meaning: the female figure in his poem was no longer abstract, it had a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: the Mother of the Exiled.
The marriage of poetry and image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrant sentiment.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, so the right-wingers have long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, a major gossip columnist for the Baptist John style for Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Liberty was not inviting anyone in but rather an early-era neocon keeping the American flame burning in a darkened world: "Mrs. Liberty stands out.
She's there to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
Not to light the way to the United States".
In an unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was entirely about perception.
Lazarus's remarkable creative act was to see it seen by the exhausted, desperate but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often disastrous journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who were looking for a place to take refuge and want to improve their lives.
His statue responded with the words of hope and warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, that's not a perspective that Miller and Trump would find justifiable in any way.
Their torch is not to guide but to dispel the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots could make the Great Britain team.
UK Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-man Scottish squad for the World Championships will make "a huge contribution to the team".
The Scottish athlete in the record number of starts has been selected for London 2017.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from this.
Black said, "We're embracing it and we're trying to figure it out and we're going to work through it".
"I've been talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it's about what they do.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they do.
British athletics: he thinks it's about what they do.
So is the guy on the street around the corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely wonderful".
Several Scottish athletes are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is a little lowly.
The captain's speech was amazing".
"Whether they're Scottish or wherever they live or wherever they train, a few athletes came out of that room very proud and really motivated.
The passion and authenticity that Eilidh naturally brought was amazing".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best overall athlete figures at previous world championships were seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the middle distance runner who broke five British and two European records last year, is leading the field.
She's going to be in the 1500m and 5000m.
Chris O'Hare, another Scot to watch, who has had a very good season, including trials for the British team and victories at the Commonwealth Games, runs in the 1500m.
Doyle remembers his first championship with Lee McConnell, the only other Scot on the team.
The team captain says she is "very proud" of the move as many of her sisters will not only be in the team but in some cases will compete for medals and fight to stay in the finals.
"The special thing about being the team captain is that it was by the votes of the other team members, so it was already a great honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it extra special for me", he added.
"Honestly, I'm proud of all the Scots who made the team.
That shows how far we've come.
And they're here as proven athletes, as athletes who are looking to get on the podium.
And as for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we're very lucky in this situation, in that we have a World Championship at home.
I mean, that's really just the effect of being able to take advantage of this indoor support and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium and we're successful.
I get a second chance to go out there and fight, and it's going to be such a great atmosphere".
Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't stand the criticism of voters, don't run for public office
The father of our country had some knowledge of negative press coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers began to heavily criticize him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, he was upset by the criticism.
But he did not silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away and we can be led to slaughter in a stupid and silent way".
Which brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 comments on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the case on the grounds that it was not serious, and online comments were full of "who cares?" reactions.
A lot of people said, "It's just Facebook".
But this is important.
That's especially important when you're someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is overwhelmingly Democratic.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a reactionary firecracker.
He was skilled at leading his province and was firmly committed to principle.
She was also quite adept at using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with her constituents, with her humorous presentation of her hairless head after chemotherapy.
So blocking people from the governor's page, which is a public forum, officially designated and run by staff members paid by the public's tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was more than regulating them.
But it's very easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hateful people making verbal attacks online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a minister; not a troll.
They all said their comments were disrespectful, thoughtless and abusive.
The priest shared a Bible quote, referring to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland Bowie, not a hateful one, but asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Post's comment section of the story, "I kindly commented that I was disappointed that he was not responding to hate crimes and other recent news".
"I also don't like the idea that when many people comment on the same issue, it's immediately dismissed by some as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others will probably call "advocacy".
The Facebook era makes it easier to make a message more appropriate by blocking an opponent or removing a negative message.
It's much cleaner than the old days when staff were sent out to pick up and burn newspapers with critical articles or arrest and silence protesters.
But, even if it's digital, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the decisions that could be a reference in the future came from Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when he banned a voter from Facebook, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R-Kentucky) was visited by the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable mail had an effect very similar to that of the Internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had its own anonymous trolls.
People using aliases like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to the newspapers challenging Washington's decisions.
According to the George Washington Articles Project, an online historical document collection, petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed the office.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and censorship are at the very core of our nation.
And true leadership is about accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be at the Renaissance Club in the comfort of his own home.
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty is hoping to be at home in the comfort of his own home over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in South Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who made the final by taking the lead on the next goal before losing to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links, feels committed to the new venue and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club being built and we see it rise to glory with this organization", Rafferty said.
The players will see the field at its best, in a fantastic condition.
Jerry did a great job building this place.
He's a fierce defender of the game and proud of his success here.
It's a great show for this field".
Although Eales has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, he will be fighting to defend a title for the first time in his 32-year career.
The Southport-based player said, "It really makes me feel special".
"I didn't have a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because the year after I won it was removed from the calendar.
It's good to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
It's a blast from last year, and it was very special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.
It was a truly special time and one we will always remember with love".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after turning 50, is back on the field.
This will be the first Scottish event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, "It always makes a little more sense when you're struggling inside".
"You want to do well, but you feel extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played some real golf.
I'm happy to go so far".
Joining the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free admission and parking, £5 per vehicle with one person and £10 per vehicle with two or more people.

I found the answer.
Imagine a "seat" with a budget of 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras, more than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science, Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism!
The staff is 117,378.
Turkey's largest "propaganda base!"
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I will talk about the head of religious affairs, Mehmet Görmez!
For days I've been searching for the answer to the question in my head...
I wonder why Mehmet Görmez was removed from his seat...
I read every article about her being sent.
No, I'm not going.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
Earlier this year...
Mehmet Görmez has prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Dianet Affairs (DIB).
President Erdogan has recalled a Mercedes S 600 worth 1 million liras.
So he had no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You might say, "Seventeen years on the job isn't enough".
The first DIB President M. Rıfat Börekçi served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, as you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
So... the president's term is open.
I'm going back to my question: why did Mehmet Görmez leave his seat?
It's settled...
Nearness to Shiites
A source close to the government said: "According to the traditional ulema, Mehmet Dönmez's people did not have a circumcision!"
The code for this sentence is: he didn't get circumcision!
The person who uttered that sentence wrote from behind: "He was found modernist by a traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Görmez was considered an innovator.
What did you mean, "innovative"?
The answer to the question was hidden in a foreign trip of Mehmet Görmez.
Date: December 27, 2015 and the date of the arrest:
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdet Conference to be held in Tehran - aimed at bringing Islamic sects closer together.
He met with Iran's religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
He prayed with the Shiite clergy in line.
And he said at the conference, "Religions are human schools that have evolved over time, representing different ideas and beliefs in understanding the religion of Islam".
All of them are seeking guidance from God.
Each is on a pathway leading to a main road, but they all end up in the same place.
It is never acceptable to identify a sect with a religion or to see sectarianism above Islamic affiliation.
Sectarian discrimination, alienation and conflict are reflections of ignorance and ignorance.
When sects overwhelm religion, the worst-hit is religion itself.
I want to underline again:
The Shi'a and Sunnis are one nation...
"No one can take revenge on another for not living Islam as he understands it"...
A year later...
Only the leader of the Caferi, Selahattin Özgündüz, from Turkey participated in the 30th Vahdet Meeting.
I mean, I...
It 's not Sunni , it 's Wahhabi .
Mehmet Görmez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of the "traditional ulema".
That's why no one representing the Turkish state attended the next Tehran conference - again.
Mehmet Görmez had already received four invitations since he came to office and could not go.
The reason was obvious: the anti-Iranian Shiite "traditional ulema" in the DIB!
Immediately after his visit to Iran, from the beginning of 2016, Mehmet Görmez's seat began to wear out.
At the head of this was the Deputy Prime Minister of the time, Numan Kurtulmuş, who was responsible for the DIB!
Mehmet Görmez was so overwhelmed that he demanded that "the DIB be connected to the Presidency".
The point is...
There was a difference in the state's view of circumcision.
The theoretical worlds of some "traditional ulema" created in the madrassas of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, identified Sunniism with Wahhabi-Selafism - in the shadow of the US!
These were anti-Iranians who couldn't even afford to go to Tehran.
It was not surprising that Jubbeli Ahmet said about Mehmet Görmez: "There is no danger to Diyanet from this".
"My Lord, grant me a better ruler who will be loyal to his people and faithful to his family"...
They used "elimination" as a symbol of Iranian hostility.
The anti-Iran campaign once carried out by FETÖ, backed by the CIA, was now being carried out under new names.
And with the FETÖ compasses...
A photo of a young man with whiskey in his hand was served to the media with the lie "son of Mehmet Görmez"!
Oh, what a coincidence!
Who has been the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: the US-led Işıkcılar Cemaati newspaper Turkey!
After all...
- Who refuses to bring Sunni Saudi into the line of Wahhabi-Selafists...
- Who doesn't incite sectarianism...
A clergyman whose consciousness was destroyed by a "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
The US cultural imperialism is continuing to Arabify Turkey rapidly.
You can be sure that the next head of religious affairs will be a representative of the Wahhabi-Selafists!
"We support Turkey in protecting its sovereignty".
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has gone to China on an official visit.
In the State House in Beijing, the capital, Cavusoglu and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a joint press conference.
"We hope Turkey will become more active in international affairs", Vang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to protect its sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey", he said.
Cavusoglu said that Turkey is seeking close cooperation with regional and international organizations, and international organizations are not alternatives but complementary.
He officially begins his second spiritual period .
Iran's president Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidential election in May, was approved by the country's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, was sworn in at a ceremony attended by the country's religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The ceremony, attended by high-level military and political figures as well as representatives of foreign countries, was attended by Turkey's Ambassador to Tehran, Rıza Hakan Tekin.
Rouhani, who will serve as president for four more years, will officially take office after the swearing-in ceremony in parliament on Saturday, August 5.
The ceremony is expected to be attended by Turkey's Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekçi.
Security measures at the border gate
The Silvegözü border gate in Hatay's Reyhanlı district will not allow the passage of trucks carrying humanitarian aid, food, medicine, cleaning supplies.
According to the information received, the Babel Air Border Gate and the Cilvegözü Border Gate, located near the Turkish border, were closed to transportation except for humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning materials due to the negative security conditions in the area.
Aid teams are allowed to exit through the Silvegy border gate.
No information was given as to how long the restriction would last.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold, Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
He rarely even uses a jar.
A housewife in Indonesia's troubled Papua province of Paniai, in her wooden house in Enarotali, puts a sweet potato, commonly known locally as "nota", directly on the fire.
After half an hour, the coated lump is removed and wiped with an appetizer, unwashed.
Degei sits on a muddy floor, doing menial jobs like washing clothes in the murky water from a nearby swamp, with no furniture.
A bucket in a roofless house is serving as a desert aunt.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was never assigned to any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers.
"No one walks around the village after 5pm".
A rare glimpse into everyday life in the mountainous regions of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969, after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 people were forced to vote by force before the Allies occupied.
An existing movement that was propagating independence against Dutch rule quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintained tight control over the region, banning foreign journalists or rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the region was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and remote, and the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital, Jayapura, to Nabire and a five-hour drive by car.
There's no public transportation.
The town of 19,000 includes wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled iron roofs turned to various yellowish-brown tones by rust.
Let alone journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here and almost no foreigners have traveled here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, referring to her brightly colored, hand-touched yellow, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies".
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, with 28 percent of the population living below the poverty line and the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced approximately $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of timber reserves.
Yet, these wealthy people, a source of poverty for the Papuans, maintain a stifling presence of Indonesia's powerful military.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reports that Freeport paid out about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including amounts up to $150,000 given to a single officer.
The Papuans' call for more autonomy threatens this golden egg-laying hen and is ruthlessly violating their rights.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
Mass killings in the mountainous areas of Papua in the 1970s have reached genocide proportions, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.
The 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Brisbane, "We'll Lose Everything", includes testimonies from the poor, including unlawful executions, torture (among other reports, rape and electrocution are particularly popular), and the brutal suppression of peaceful protests, which took place the previous year.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because there are incidents every week", says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Pressure was increased as Papua's resources brought settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The region's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come for economic reasons.
Javanese warung buffets sell gado-gado served with fried chicken and a peanut sauce mixed with vegetables.
The locals are having a hard time competing.
"The migrants sell chicken and vegetables at cheaper prices than the local Papuans in traditional markets", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for work.
"This has caused the indigenous Papuans, the Papuans mama-mama (women) to lose market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations in Papua during the 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, took the game to 27 of Papua's 29 regions, including Panaia.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the local people feel betrayed.
"We are heartbroken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he would fulfill our hope that justice would be restored", You says.
In fact, Paniai experienced his worst just two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children singing Christmas carols outside a bonfire in Enarotali were overtaken by two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles.
The frightened kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented their style and later returned with four soldiers, according to local priest Javed Tebai.
Victims and witnesses said he chased a group of soldiers intoxicated and beat them with the barrels of his rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired on the group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the next day, the situation escalated.
About 1,000 Papuans men, women and children gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita (running in a ring and mimicking the song of birds) of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military garrison.
As tensions grew, the soldiers were told by internal radio: "If the crowd resist more than three times, shoot them".
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and begged the crowd to return home.
No one was going to listen.
"When I turned around, I was shot in my left wrist", he told TIME in the window of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but he says the bullet came from a collected military round.
"It was crowded, there were many shots fired", he adds.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, the native Alfius Youw was shot three times.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Yohan, who, like many Indonesians, was known by only one name, told TIME in a pessimistic tone.
"I saw her die... and I kissed her".
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" the station because it was under attack.
Papua police spokesman Branch Director Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015: "When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves".
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the deaths did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Jokowi made an impassioned speech in Jayapura three weeks later, expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case solved immediately so it doesn't happen again".
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had established a non-judicial mechanism for historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the violations were long ago.
Some in the '90s, some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to resolving these violations, but there are processes we have to go through".
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto backtracked, saying there were no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It's all going to be settled by law".
Wiranto, who is accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" related to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had already been solved.
The families of the Paniai victims have been bitterly skeptical of such claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the past three years, but without any progress", says Yohan.
"I'm tired of it".
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the soldiers, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus echoes the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the soldier after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the soldier came looking for me", he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in the village of Deiyai, Paniai's neighbor.
During the clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others, including children, were injured.
Ravianus Douw, 24, drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's construction office.
Police say villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one.
Dominggu Badii, 29, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being treated, told TIME: "We were so panicked, we were afraid of retaliation".
"I've been hiding in my house for two days".
The Deiyai parliament called for the officials involved to be held accountable and the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is fueling the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live scattered throughout Papua's green mountainous centre.
Many joined the rebel army, the Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of Papuans by carrying out random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some senior OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, are from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and held arbitrarily by the military in recent years under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some never seen again.
Among the Papuan people, Paniai is known as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for the natives to buy.
The bread is not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly nuts, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women who can sustain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest at the local market.
10 bills are only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities grew between the indigenous Papuans and the new immigrants who arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
The jobs that are already scarce often go to immigrants who are better educated and wealthier.
It is rare for Papuans to have the capital or skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money", says John Gobai, president of the Panai tribal council.
The isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, there are strict reporting restrictions for international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant institutions" despite being rarely allowed to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi's election campaign promises to lift restrictions on news coverage and increase transparency were not fulfilled.
In a statement, he said: "For foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua, there are new dangers: visa denial and blacklisting".
The lack of media control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "the wide-ranging and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir ignored the group's claims, telling reporters in Jakarta, "The democratic system in Indonesia is still in place and there is a free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence in human rights cases".
The locals want more foreign government involvement.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local residents broke their silence with pleas of "We want freedom", according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say it's unlikely they'll vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a well-meaning person, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai attack", says tribal council president Gobai.
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that they are in dire need of scant education and health services, besides living under the imminent threat of a tyrannical soldier.
Gobai says that like other Papuans, the people of Paniai see their vote as a "debt" they owe Jokowi to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice".
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out one last symbolic act of resistance: burying the body of one victim on the land directly across from the police and military station.
They will at least ensure that those responsible do not forget their crimes, knowing that justice can never be served.
"A member of our family has been killed", says Yacobus, his head bowed forward.
"What else can we do?"
Fire has engulfed Dubai's Torch skyscraper for the second time
A fire in Dubai on Friday engulfed the world's tallest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall 79-story building.
This is the second major fire to spread rapidly to the high rise building called the Torch Tower in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given as to the cause of the massive fire.
"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get to the 50th floor", a resident who identified himself as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said firefighters extinguished the large fire around 4am local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government has announced that they are trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used in the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
The Torch Management's investigation following the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, which is the outer panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation and cladding panel system on London's Grenfell Tower, where 80 people died, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
'Social assistance' to more than 4 thousand chronic patients
The Social Policy and Family Ministry has announced that the social assistance program will be launched for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases.
The Ministry, which plans to provide monthly support to patients over two-thirds of the minimum wage through the assistance program, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information received, the details and implementation principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" that began its work a while ago with the instruction of the Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya were revealed.
The social assistance program, which was launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens who are struggling with chronic diseases and are experiencing economic and psychological challenges, is in many respects the first in the world.
The Ministry, which has completed all the necessary preparations for the launch of the program, will provide families with not only cash but also regular psychosocial support through the social assistance program.
The aim is to ensure that poor citizens with chronic diseases and their families who continue their treatment processes at home are not left alone both financially and spiritually.
According to the studies, in the first phase, poor citizens battling with Sub-Acute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and measles microbes, will be given regular psychosocial and cash support under the new social assistance program.
In the later stages of the program, it will be extended to help poor citizens who are struggling with other rare and high-risk diseases.
In addition to the allowance, which is planned to be more than two thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments may be made to tuberculosis patients who are unable to pay for their own medical care, are bedridden or who are in need of home improvement.
To qualify for the allowance, the household's per capita income must be less than two thirds of the net monthly minimum wage.
In addition, citizens with SSPE should have a health board report prepared according to the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulation on Measurement, Classification and Health Board Reports to Disabled Persons".
According to the survey, more than 1 in 5 U.S. passengers bring prohibited substances on board.
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items onto the plane from U.S. Department of Transportation Security checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who unknowingly carried prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 percent claimed to have later realized they were accidentally traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The study of more than 1,000 people by Stratos Jet Charters, a charter jet service, also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Among the participants who admitted to deliberately trying to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Y-generation, while less than 15 percent were X-generation.
The most common items stolen from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly passing sharp tools through security, while 2.2 percent of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants also admitted to knowingly carrying illicit drugs on the plane.
The company said it's conducting surveys of passengers nationwide to find out how many airport security personnel accidentally brought in contraband and how many did it on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to smuggle goods through security, knowingly or unknowingly, are the ones who fly the most.
Still, as the firm points out, the TSA rules are a bit of a mess and confusing.
People are often unsure of what fluids or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of the substance seized by the TSA turned up in banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA might be treating the books like contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international ones.
China welcomed the US's statements
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking at a press conference in the capital Beijing, said they were concerned about Tillerson's remarks to the Pyongyang administration that "we are not looking for a regime change, a collapse of the regime, a rapid reunification of the peninsula, and an excuse to send our troops north of the 38th parallel".
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang said Tillerson reiterated the Washington administration's principles on the North Korea issue, and expressed hope that the United States would implement those principles effectively and in a policy focused on tangible results.
Wang stressed that the security of the Korean peninsula is the priority and that the sides should find a middle way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue.
EPA Chairman Pruitt has stopped delaying Obama-era emissions-reduction laws.
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency Chairman Scott Pruitt reversed a previous decision to delay implementation of Obama-era laws that reduced air pollution emissions that cause dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented change by making his organization more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than past administrations.
He never mentioned a legal challenge to his previous position in a federal high court.
The issue is whether the states will begin meeting the 2015 deadline for ground level ozone standards on October 1.
Pruitt had announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, had long served as a reliable ally against tighter environmental regulations.
Since Pruitt came to Washington, he has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday's sudden change is the latest legal defeat for Pruitt's agenda to reverse the regulation.
Last month, a federal grand jury in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator's attempt to delay the implementation of an Obama administration law requiring oil and gas companies to regulate and reduce methane leaks was overstepping the limits of his authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that the reversal in ozone standards only reinforces EPA's commitment to meeting the new standards on time with states and working through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous work, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for decisions, waited to be sued by activist groups and others, and agreed to settle the dispute to set timelines for decisions".
"We don't believe in regulation by litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously".
Still, the EPA's statement noted that Pruitt could use his "power of attorney and all other legally available authority" once again at some point to ensure that regulations are "backed by sound policies and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider rewrite of the ozone laws.
A bill passed by the legislature last month seeks to delay the implementation of 2015 laws by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The EPA's decision to reverse our lawsuits is a significant gain for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the dirty smoke that flows into their communities".
The case was brought to New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when general pollutants are released into the atmosphere by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources that react to sunlight.
The resulting dirty smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in a rapidly affected group of people and contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise reversal of decision.
Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said: "It is disturbing that so much pressure has to be put on the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe to get this sensible step".
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological struggle to pander to environmental polluters and interest groups".
Inflation is one digit
Turkey, which recorded the largest increase in exports in six years in July, brought unemployment to 10.5 percent in April, which was 13 percent in January, and the economic confidence index rose to a 3.5 year high, and inflation dropped to one digit.
According to the data released by the Turkish Statistical Agency (TÜİK) yesterday, the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) rose 0.15 percent in July, while annual inflation fell to one house for the first time since January at 9.79 percent.
In terms of the main spending groups, in July, the highest increase on a monthly basis was seen in the restaurant and hotel group with 1.75 percent, while the group that showed the greatest decline was clothing and footwear with 3.51 percent.
The highest year-on-year increase was in the transportation group, at 15.24 percent.
"The moderate pace of inflation is affected by the fall in food and clothing prices", Business Investment Economist Muammer Kömürcüoğlu said, noting that inflation fell to one house in July, in line with expectations.
But the core indicators are up from the previous month, contrary to the headline.
"We don't expect a relaxation in the central bank's tough stance", he said.
Headline inflation declined, but core inflation indicators rose.
The B index of the special comprehensive TUEF indicators, which the Central Bank also closely monitors, rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent.
Enver Erkan, Deputy Research Director of Kapital FX, said that inflation could be closed at 9.3 percent this year.
"The opportunity may pass to the Central Bank as of the first months of 2018", he explained.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek: Inflation will close the year with one digit.
The central bank's tightening will continue until inflation drops below 7 percent.
We'll finalize the reforms at the nearby Food Committee.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci: We are happy that inflation has fallen to single digits, but it needs to be permanent.
In order to combat inflation, food prices must be reduced and supplies increased.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: In the coming months, the annual inflation may be upwardly trending due to the base effect, but from the first months of 2018, the decline in inflation will be evident.
We predict annual inflation will fall even lower.
I wish Fenerbahçe good luck in their next games.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said that their second-half performance was not enough to make the breakthrough in the 1-1 draw with Fenerbahce in the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round.
Speaking at the press conference after the match, Foda said that Fenerbahce is a top-level team and said, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half".
We evened it in the second half.
We got a shot for the second goal.
I'm still proud of the team.
They changed the flow of the game in the second half.
We could have been a little better.
Little things in the game were decisive.
"I wish Fenerbahçe success in their next games".
Foda said they felt very good during their stay in Turkey and were happy with the hospitality they received.
Fernando is in Istanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, with whom Galatasaray Club has started transfer negotiations, has arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer was received enthusiastically by fans at Atatürk Airport.
Fernando left the airport in a private vehicle waiting for him under security measures, with the yellow-and-red fans cheering and showing their love.
Fernando, 30, who started his career with Vila Nova in Brazil and has also played for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, plays in midfield.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign with the yellow-and-red team after undergoing a medical.
Galatasaray, who is continuing to work on the transfer, has secured a deal with Manchester City for 5 million 250 thousand euros for Fernando, whom he has been trying to add to his squad for a long time.
Flash Raqqa move from the US:
Colonel Dillon, who is in charge of the US Defense Department (Pentagon) via video conference from Baghdad, said that the Raqqa Internal Security Force (RIGF) trained by the coalition has begun to settle in areas cleansed of ISIS in the city.
"In areas of the city that have been cleared, the Raqqa Internal Security Force, made up mostly of Arabs and local anti-ISIS volunteers, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from fleeing or returning", Dillon said.
Dillon said that 230 more people have completed training this week and joined the group, adding that "the number of the force in question is 850 now".
Dillon said the coalition has trained the group in basic weapons training as well as first aid, armed conflict, search and checkpoint operations.
Dillon said that the interest in the Raqqa Internal Security Force is very intense and that the coalition will continue to screen applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main backbone of the PYD/PKK, in the takeover of Raqqa.
The PKK/PYD terrorist organization appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Muhammed as co-chair of the Raqqa civil administration council.
It is alleged that the PKK/PYD will be in the military force in Raqqa.
Dillon also announced that the US-led coalition had collected heavy weapons from the Syrian opposition group, Shaheed Karyateyn (Shuhouk), in the Al Tanif camp in southern Syria, which the US-led coalition cut off support last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shuhouk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment that the coalition had given them, but some small arms and light vehicles were allowed to stay", Dillon said.
The US announced last week that it was withdrawing its support from Shuhuk on the grounds that he was out patrolling outside the non-combat zones agreed upon with Russia and was engaged in activities not related to the fight against ISIS.
The group wants to fight against the regime of Bashar al-Assad as well as ISIS.
According to leaked phone records, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The minutes of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump pressured him not to publicly say he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States rebuked the president of Mexico for holding a cannon in public and was rumored to have said, "You can't tell the press".
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised to pay for the project to Mexico.
Notes of his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which sparked a heated dialogue, have also been released.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the U.S. deal to take refugees to Australia was "charade", "rotten" and "stupid", and that the Obama administration's deal would look "stupid" after he proposed a ban on the U.S. resettling a refugee.
Mr. Trump ended his speech by telling Mr. Turnbull, "That was the most disgusting speech I've ever given all day".
The patient's family broke the doctor's nose.
Doctors and employees of the Turkish Higher Specialized Education and Research Hospital stopped working yesterday morning in response to the beating of a doctor by his colleagues.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with banners with the words "No to violence in health" in their hands.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç, Head of the Children's Cardiology Clinic at the hospital, said, ""No to violence in health" seems to me to be an inadequate slogan, even a side slogan".
Violence has no place in health care.
"If this goes on, this population will soon find no health care team to serve them", he said.
The action of health workers was also supported by Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara First District Public Hospitals General Secretary Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkey Higher Specialized Education and Research Hospital Chief Physician Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and patients in the hospital garden.
Patch, who condemned the incident, said:
Unfortunately, violence against healthcare workers is on the rise.
We've seen an example of this again last night, when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient's relative.
While we as a state, ministry and governor are taking all possible measures to end these incidents as soon as possible, we demand that the public be more aware of this issue.
I condemn yesterday's events on behalf of my patients and healthcare workers.
Odabaş, who stressed that the society should be aware of violence in health, said, "Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication that we experience from time to time".
"We will take our own precautions, but most importantly, our nation has its own health worker", he said.
Turkmen said that the legal process has begun and that "our laws on violence in healthcare have been effective enough".
The government is enforcing it.
The police are working on it now.
In the past, they were always empty, but now it's a direct public prosecution and the state's attorney is assigned to follow up on the case.
"There are also examples of severe punishments taken in this regard", he said.
After the explanations, the workers went back to work.
The alleged incident occurred around 5:45 p.m. the day before.
The patient's family attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the heart and vascular surgery department and gave the news of his death.
While being escorted away from the scene by doctors and assistants, the police were called to the hospital.
The attackers were detained while Uzbek's nose was broken.
A doctor who witnessed the incident said:
When our friend went to the patient's family to report the death of a patient, the family attacked our two friends, blaming us and our friend for the situation.
Our friend's nose is broken, he's covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid him.
We were separated by a security set for 15 to 20 minutes.
If the patient's loved ones had broken through that security fence, things would have been much worse.
A heavy blow to Daesh in Gaziantep: 102 bags...
According to the information received, in the framework of the investigation conducted by the Gaziantep Republic Prosecutor General's Office, the Directorate of the Gaziantep Security Directorate's Counter-Terrorism Branch, as a result of intelligence work on the DEAŞ armed terrorist organization, an operation carried out at a warehouse in Kayaönü neighborhood, which was determined to belong to the terrorist organization DEAŞ, 102 bags containing 5 thousand 100 kilograms of ammonium nitrate were seized.

Six people were taken into custody and were sent to the authorities for questioning.
The suspects were arrested by the Peace Prison Judge, the guard they were sent to.
The looting of the YPG in Syria...
The United States intervened .
According to local sources, terrorists from the YPG, with the military support of the United States, looted the homes of residents of Tel Semin in the northern countryside of Raqqa, where the terrorist organization entered on the grounds of fighting the Daesh.
The reaction of the civilians whose homes were looted and confiscated turned into a confrontation with the terrorist organization.
U.S. forces in the area then entered the town with armored vehicles.
Cougar MRAP armored vehicles, personnel carriers and Husky mine detectors were seen to form a buffer zone in the town.
The YPG is preventing civilians from entering the cities they control, fleeing death in Raqqa, which has come under fire as part of an anti-ISIS operation.
A local activist network called "Rakka is being slaughtered silently" announced that 121 civilians were killed in the organization's artillery fire yesterday, in July alone.
Let's not put off the old world fights till tomorrow.
Delayed perception of domestic and global realities can lead to crises not just for ordinary people but for countries.
One of the reasons behind the backwardness of the East in terms of what we call "orientalization" is that it may be that certain focuses are blocking or making the reality of the world seem out of place.
Don Quixote and Oblomov Truth and delayed or no perception of change have been the subject of literary speculation.
Cervantes' Don Quixote is a mecha who still thinks he's a knight at a time when the bourgeoisie is just beginning to form.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy legacy of people who think that everything can go on as it was when they ignore the facts.
China, for example, was an open country with sea power until the late 15th century, when it was closed off by the rise of a conservative dynasty.
This lasted until the captains of boats that sailed out of Chinese territorial waters were executed.
We Turks, with one foot, eye and ear in the West and the other foot, eye and ear in the East, have had a constant dilemma about perceiving reality and change, starting with the Ottomans.
We tried to move yesterday to today, to understand today with concepts that fit the old conditions, to think of yesterday as tomorrow.
And part of us has been as quick as the thinkers in developed countries to perceive both the realities of home and the world and change.
This has led to constant conflict and tension.
The encounter of madrassa and university, the new army and the modern army, faith and doubt, has led to a dramatic dualism.
Progressivism is obsolete, and even worse, it's not accepted that positions that were new and advanced in a period of time will eventually become obsolete and backward.
The progressive of yesterday, after a period, began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous", while those who tried to interpret the conditions of the home and the world in accordance with the current reality, began to declare them "Trayed".
The most important lesson in the Ottoman Empire was that those who were late in perceiving the realities of the homeland and the world dominated thought and state life, and eventually the empire disintegrated, collapsed and the people became impoverished.
The most important lesson our Ottoman history taught the Republic was that the world conjuncture and the perception of rapid change were an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
And because this lesson was so well assimilated, we were able to be the model country for this geography that managed to maintain its unity, its integrity, its stability in peace from the First World War to today.
And in order to survive the global transformation that is coming, we need to move beyond memories and into reality.
In other words, it will do no one any good to carry on the senseless camping and blood feuds that crippled our democracy in the past.
Moreover, in today's world, the slightest mistake can lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East, which is where we are.
Operation of historical relics in Mush
The governor's office said that the provincial gendarmerie command had conducted an operation to smuggle historical artifacts.
"As a result of the investigations, two gold coins, one silver coin, 20 bronze coins, one gold bracelet, two bronze rings, one broken glass bracelet, four stone objects, eight necklaces, one pink-white stone object, one picture frame, 23 stone objects of different sizes and colors, four sharp metal objects, six covers and pages of the old period, and some pages of the Quran-Karaim, were seized.
"Our operations in the fight against crime and criminals will be continued with determination for the peace and security of our people".
The wind in Turkey
Global giants, who trust in Turkey's future, fought the brake on the wind power auction yesterday.
The world record was broken in the tender for the model set up by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing external dependence.
The tender, which will lower Turkey's energy costs, has also opened the way for a $1 billion investment and nearly 4 thousand jobs.
By the beginning of 2019, domestically produced wind turbines will be included in the system.
The renewable energy resource areas (RES) wind power license auction, which was opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, was attended by 8 consortia, including giants from the US, China, Germany and Denmark.
The auction opened the financial bid envelopes to determine the five bidders who first made the lowest bid.
After the initial bid envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19/kWh.
The open range of the decline is set at 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, the joint venture groups, which included Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas, decided not to participate in the open reduction.
The open reduction was contested by groups including Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang.
After the withdrawal of the consortium, which included Nordex, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon remained in the last two.
MingYang-First Construction has taken 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy consortium has never used a break.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak: Record day for Turkey.
The open reduction went on for 30 rounds.
The winner of the intense dispute between the two consortia was the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon joint venture group, which made the lowest bid at $3.48 cents/kWh.
The consortium offered $3.49 cents per kilowatt hour in the tender, but the tender commission chaired by Deputy Deputy Alparslan Bayraktar withdrew the offer to $3.48.
Turkey has set a world record with the result of the two-hour YEKA auction.
The bidding price of $3.48/kWh is the lowest in the world.
The previous record was held by Mexico at $3.84/c/kWh.
After the tender was concluded, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference, said that the victory of the German company Siemens is an important message to the region and the world.
We have big goals.
The results today show how solid and confident the economy and energy markets are moving into the future.
I am proud to show that Turkey is one of the most reliable countries in the region and the world to invest in, no matter how many regional crises there are in the world.
"The biggest contribution to this picture that we are proud of as 80 million people in Turkey is the President who has brought Turkey to this point in his 15 years of power and leadership", he said.
Albayrak said that the tender was a new era with open, transparent and competitive competition, and one of the most important steps was that the cost of buying wind power with a local contribution to yesterday was 10.3 dollars per kilowatt hour, down to a historic record of 3.48 dollars per cent, a world record price.
I'm proud of it, for my people, for my country.
Minister Albayrak said that they aim to put in place the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, and said, "I hope that by the end of 2019, we will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system".
The turbines will be installed in five designated areas.
The winning company will receive a total of 1,000 megawatts of installed capacity, provided they install at least 50 megawatts of wind power in each of these five regions.
The total investment of the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon group will be over $1 billion.
With the local wind farms up and running, at least 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity will be generated each year, and wind will meet the annual electricity needs of about 1.1 million homes.
The wind farms will also reduce emissions by an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year.
The winning company will build a factory with an investment of over $100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will undertake R&D work in at least three of the five areas of wing, generator design, material technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearbox for a total of 10 years.
The R&D work will be carried out by 50 technical staff, 80 percent of whom are local engineers, with an annual budget of $5 million.
The factory will be built 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's been licensed for 30 years.
The chairman of the board of directors of the company, Kazım Türker, who won the tender, said that 64 percent of the domestic production will be in the project, and 35 percent of the equipment will come from abroad.
Turkers said the tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
Murtaza Ata, the head of Kalyon Holding Energy Group, said: "It was a tender that will reduce Turkey's dependence on the outside world by another thousand megawatts".
"We're happy with the result", he said.
Siemens Gamesa Turkey Senior Manager Hakan Yildirim said that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years and said, "We will do everything we can to further reduce the cost of electricity units".
The wind turbines to be built at the plant will have a minimum of 65 percent localisation.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
Each of the five zones will have a minimum of 50 MW of power, totaling 1000 MW.
Employment of 3,750 people , 10 years of R&amp;D compulsory , $5 million in R&amp;D money every year .
1,000 MW Wind Facility 65% Location Rate Production of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 MWe.
Over $1 billion investment in a 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity, over $100 million factory investment.
Electricity generation to meet the needs of about 1.1 million homes, at least 3 billion kWh of electricity per year, an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emissions reduction.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists call for justice by reviving the racist lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury was driven through a crowd in rural Monroe, Georgia, and hurtled toward the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, was blocked before it reached the bridge by a group of armed white men.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a thinly striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and carefully peered in through the windshield.
Inside, the people were terrified.
"We want that shit, Roger!" he yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams were heard through the darkness as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrific scene from June 22 is only a reenactment.
But when a slap was thrown around "Roger"'s neck, almost everyone in the audience sighed in a very realistic way.
Since 2005, human rights activists have returned to Ford Bridge in Moore to reenact the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one's been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "It's unbelievable that even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are, not a single person has been arrested in all these years".
"It's a stain on history but a burden on our souls".
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights advocate.
For him, this revival is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
He said: "We want a lawsuit, we want a result, we want a healing, we want a reconciliation, but first we have to get justice".
"We can't have a healing and a reconciliation until we get justice".
The coroner is placing a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Ford lynching in Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected of lynching.
But not one of them was ever investigated.
Although the suspects remained on the run for decades, human rights advocates say the twin motivations of the lynchings were always well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in a primary election later that summer.
According to the FBI, at about the same time as the election, black associate Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight apparently involving a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in town was that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey, went to prison.
But as they drove away from the prison, they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore, and a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It appears that Harrison arranged and ordered the murders".
"It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement "that not only participated in the murder, "but destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks was more concise.
He said, "This was a voting rights massacre".
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'This is what will happen to you if you register and vote.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been directing the annual revival of the Ford Bridge lynchings in Moore.
Her performance is all about detail, remarkable, and based on a deep-seated form of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene says that's the point.
She said, "We don't want to talk about lynching because it confronts all of us with the ugliness inside us".
"But if you don't listen to me or what's happening to me, I can't have a relationship with you".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) packed a room and listened as Greene eagerly entered the well-rehearsed outlines of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is serving as assistant director on Greene.
For years, the President played the part of the Klansman, but he says the role never gets easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because that's not me".
"But I think it's important to keep that past alive because we don't want to go back to that time".
Actors playing Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, were rehearsing their lines throughout the room.
The game begins when Malcolm shouts at Hester, who is very angry because he slept with his wife Dorothy, and pushes her.
"Z...i, get off my property!"
He's reacting to the rascony.
There's a bang.
And then everyone (at least the black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
He asked Rascona, "What?!"
She was nervous, she was surprised.
Was I too harsh?
Greene said, "No", with a chuckle.
"I just don't think white people said sh... at the time".
One of the black players said, "Yes", and he threw a mixed stone.
"You have to press the R.
So the energy in the room changes and a kind of intimacy replaces the restlessness.
Everyone is dedicated to getting it right, not just for the sake of the game but also in memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time Rascona says the N-word, sharp and emphatic.
No one's laughing at all.
The resuscitation is ending violently and quickly.
There's screaming, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman in black, standing on the bodies of the actors, reads Billie Holiday's melancholy hymn "Strange Fruit".
One of the two words breaks her voice.
A hundred yards back, an average of four dozen spectators wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple came all the way from Ithaca, New York, most of them from down the road, to see the performance.
As Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the Malcolm and Dorsey cemeteries, they all endured the oppressive moisture of Georgia for nearly eight hours.
Up until this point, the murders had been an anecdote, but now standing in the same place as the lynch mob means the weather feels like a curse.
As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to approach and examine the bodies.
The children kneel on their hands, clutching at the fake blood and the still bodies, and whisper to each other.
A little boy mutters, as if to remind himself, "They're not really dead".
A few minutes later, Greene thanks the crowd and then he's gone.
Actors throw the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh in the suit, playing the president Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow actors and tears well up in their arms, the emotional toll of the performance finally coming to him.
One of the women whispers, "It's okay".
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason".
Then the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is having a passionate conversation about rejuvenation with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski is having trouble finding words to describe how the performance made her feel.
He said, "Hearing these horrible, horrible words and these behaviors... come from people like you and they do it because they look like you".
"What it does to me is make me think that the lynchings are still going on", he added, "these are just called police gun attacks anymore".
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is the center of attention at the table, eating and talking about his civil rights memories.
He said he's already started planning his performance for next year.
He said: "The revival is inspiring in a way because it describes what we have endured but it is also instructive".
"Like if you don't learn from it, it could happen again.
Those who do not investigate their own past, those who do not know their own past, are doomed to repeat it".

AK Party special website for congress
By the AK Party, 6.
A website called "akkongreler.com" was created for the regular Congress process.
The website has a brochure, materials and images that the party organization will use in this process.
The site's 'Communication strategy' section lists 14 rules to follow during the congress process.
In his message on the website, the President and General Chairman of the AK Party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, warned the organization's members to comply with the party's corporate identity during the congress process.
Erdogan said in his message, "We are now entering a new period of breakthrough".
We must renew and refresh ourselves to achieve our 2023 goals with more robust steps.
"We must continue to work hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, as we did yesterday".
To revive the business, Pearson made 3,000 more layoffs, cut profits.
British education group Pearson said it would make 3,000 more layoffs on Friday as it embarks on another restructuring programme to address the pressures facing the business, cutting its interim profit share by 72 percent.
CEO John Fallon said the layoffs, mostly in late 2018 and early 2019, will be in addition to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to save a further £300 million (US$394 million) by trying to revive the business that is rapidly moving to digital learning with a third cost-cutting programme.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after reporting core sales of £2.05 billion, up 1 percent in the first half.
Text 2 has led to death again!
According to the preliminary report from the M.E. Office, the preliminary findings from the preliminary autopsy report on Hakan's death are suicide.
The detailed examination found no bruising or marks on the child's body.
The cause of death was asphyxiation from a tightness in the elastic bandage around his neck.
The bandage his family listed as the bandage was also found to be the elastic bandage used in the wounds.
According to Muslim Sarıyar of Habertürk newspaper, after the detailed report on the death of the child was prepared, it was learned that the report indicating that the incident was a suicide will be sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Büyükçekmece, which conducts the investigation.
Police are investigating the boy's suicide in detail, and are also examining the computer that was seized after the incident.
It was stated that the police will also apply for the statement of Hakan's friends.
It also says that information obtained from the computer of Hakan, who his family says is "cleaned", could be used to reach third parties or a gang.
Police are investigating the possibility that Hakan was driven to suicide by a gang.
The certainty that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes to the violent "Metin".
The "Metin2", which was banned by the Antalya Governorate last year for children under 15 years old, came to the fore with the murder of 13-year-old "mini hacker" Metin Kang in 2009.
Textin2, which was designed in Korea in 2005, requires a membership to be registered and accessed.
Players try to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
And when you do, there's war, there's more violence.
The game features combat scenes with cutting, piercing weapons such as slingshots, swords, axes, and axes, as well as scenes of people being torn apart by wild animals and their flesh eaten.
The player buys characters with money to make them stronger.
The family who buried their children the next day, continued to claim murder.
Baba Mehmet Ekinci said, "My dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he can hurt himself or anyone else because of the game", and added, "They wrapped an elastic band around his neck and tied a knot to his side".
That's how he found out, son.
We definitely don't think our son could hurt himself or anyone else or even kill himself over an online game.
We knew you were playing a game like that.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's just say he got a little bored and he just dropped out.
Anne Gülizar Ekinci said, "No one goes in or out of the building".
It says my son came in at a certain time.
None of them hold up.
When her brother came home, there was only one chair.
"But when his body was found, there were two chairs next to the computer", he said.
First strike: he may have been involved in a gang.
Families generally don't pay attention to this.
They're like, "I don't care if my kid's home or what".
The child communicates with many people through games.
There could have been a loan-to-lend situation, or a swear word.
Or he invited someone from the game into his house, and they might have had a problem.
He may have been affected by the problems he was having with other people he communicated with through the game, not directly through the game.
The visual, the fiction, the child may have thought it was real.
The trauma that led to the suicide could be related to the blackmail.
If the child is faced with a situation of complaining to the parent, there is also a situation of being driven to depression because he cannot solve the problem.
He couldn't have killed himself because of the play itself.
There's also the possibility that the kid might be in a gang.
He could be in a gang.
Individually, it's not something that the kid could have done alone.
Füsun NEBİL: Families should know how their children interact
We can't say that games are harmful.
Research also suggests that games are beneficial for children's development.
What's important here is that parents pay attention to what their kids are playing and how they're interacting with gamers online.
Parents need to know what content affects their children and how to prevent it.
In Turkey, only two children are said to have died from the game in the last five years.
It shows that a child's suicide is not just the result of games.
What was it that made this boy do it?
We need to find out first.
You have to look at the sociology and psychology around the kid.
The return on the stock market in Istanbul for 8 months stood at 50 percent
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend that began in December 2016 in July and moved upwards to the 8th month in a row.
The index thus gained 45.3 percent for the period, the first time it has increased for eight consecutive months since July 2007.
The BIST 100 index, which has outperformed the world's major stock exchanges including Germany, the US, Britain and Japan in its performance since the beginning of the year, did not leave the lead in July.
The BIST 100 index, which ended July with a 7.06 percent increase, was followed by the Dow Jones index in the United States with a 2.54 percent increase, and the FTSE 100 index in the United Kingdom with a 0.81 percent increase.
The DAX index in Almaty and the Nikkei index in Japan ended July with a loss.
As of January-July, the BIST 100 index has been shown to perform higher than both the major world stock exchanges and the emerging market stock exchanges.
This year, the BIST 100 index gained 37.6 percent, followed by the Dow Jones index with a 10.76 percent increase, the DAX index with a 5.55 percent gain, the Nikkei index with a 4.55 percent increase, and the FTSE 100 index with a 3.21 percent increase.
The MSCI EM index, which is an indicator of emerging markets, returned 23 percent.
The BIST 100 index has shown similar performance in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last gained value for 8 consecutive months between December 2006 and July 2007, had increased by 38.3 percent in this period.
The BIST 100 index also completed eight consecutive months of gains between August 1996 and March 1997, and nine consecutive months between May 1997 and January 1998.
In a statement to the AA, Eren Can Umut, Director of Investment Research at Meksa, said that the BIST 100 index has been rising for 8 months, and since the beginning of the year, the rise has exceeded 37 percent.
Umut noted that the MSCI emerging markets (EM) index has risen by 23 percent, and even if we look at these ratios, there is a positive split.
The flow of funds to developing countries has been continuing since the beginning of the year.
Especially funds in the high yield search prefer countries with higher interest rates.
The domestic markets are already being affected in a positive way.
And of course, the global risk appetite is pretty high.
This makes risky asset-like stock indices popular.
In the US, we see almost every week new record levels being tested as the S&P 500 index has risen by nearly 11 percent since Christmas.
Emphasizing that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) 3 percent rate increase forecast earlier this year stressed markets but eliminated uncertainty by using the Fed's verbal guidance policy quite well, Umut noted that there is a market insensitive to the Fed's rate increase.
The hope was that inflation in the US was not yet at the desired level, and that the Fed's expectations that it would not be hasty about raising interest rates and avoid radical moves were also very influential in current pricing.
"Although the expectations of the faster growing US economy thanks to Trump have a positive effect on the stock markets for a period, the failure to fulfil the promises strengthens the hand of the Fed and the market in this context in terms of a faster growth and a faster response to inflation", said Umut, who was told that the failure of US President Donald Trump to cancel the health care reform known as "Obamacare" reinforces the perception that expansionary fiscal policies will not be able to fulfill their promises.
Umut pointed out that 2016 was a year of many negative developments for the Turkish markets, and said that the BIST 100 index, which is negatively dispersed and over-sold, is in an effort to close the gap.
Umut said that the current situation could be interpreted as a trigger for the desire to close the gap between the increase in the appetite to take risks abroad and the similarities in the domestic markets.
Umut noted that he saw some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with 108,600 levels.
Especially the 109,500-110,000 area is a critical threshold in the short term.
It's normal for profitable sales to occur once it's approaching these levels.
We think that in the short term, a new local or global story should be created for pricing above 110,000.
A downward push of 107,500 support for now could trigger profit selling.
In this case, I think we can see a loosening of the support to the 106,000-105,500 area, even if we follow the 107,000 interim support.
In particular, a break of 105,500 support could lead to a pullback to 104,300, which is Fibo's 50 percent of the increase from 100,000 to 108,600.
He said that the Fed's expectations are already clear, but that the possibility of a balance sheet reduction program could trigger a strengthening in the US dollar, even if no interest rate increase is expected in September.
"The most important thing is what the ECB will say", he said, noting that this could trigger short-term profit selling in the developing country's stock indexes, which are in the shadow of over-buying.
Following the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said that they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the autumn, and this speech led to the euro/dollar exchange rate rising above the 1.1700 level.
So announcements that the €60 billion monthly asset purchase program will be reduced or may be ended will mean that post-Fed liquidity on a global scale will also be reduced by the ECB.
"So, in the name of the markets of countries like Turkey, which have high current account deficits and must have access to foreign funds, negative pricing may occur".
Erol Gürcan, the director of Gedik Investments Investment Advisory, said that after Trump was elected president in the US in November 2016, there was a very serious rally in the global stock markets.
Gürcan said that the main element that triggered this rally movement was Trump's promises to reduce taxes, which were the first to increase global growth expectations.
The stock market in Istanbul was also at the top of the global rally.
While one of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained quite discounted in recent years compared to similar emerging market countries, it is worth mentioning that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), which became active in March, has had a significant impact on the rise in the index so far.
In the rest of the year, the positive developments are reflected in the price increases and the KGF, which plays an important role in this rise, has gradually reached saturation, Gürcan said that although the BIST 100 index continues to be discounted compared to similar country markets, the search for a new story for the rest of the year may also gradually come to the fore.
Georgan noted that the 180-day action plan, which has been eagerly awaited for some time, the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the provision of regulations to support company profits, and the possible tax reduction that has been discussed in the recent period can make a positive contribution in this sense.
Georgan stressed that the fact that the central banks of important developed countries such as the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England (BoE) will tighten their existing expansionary monetary policy positions slowly but surely is also among the critical risk factors for developing countries, assessing that "the fact that the Fed, which has been continuing moderate interest rate increases for some time, will most likely start the balance sheet reduction process after September, the possibility of the ECB ending its asset purchase program in the near future and the possibility that the BOE will be one of the major developed country central banks that will increase interest rates after the Fed will be the main developments to be followed in this sense".
In the coming period, the index's possible correction movements are critical, as the 104,150-104,600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average, is critical to the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year.
Georgan said that if the current upward trend is maintained and the current historical peak level of 108.605 is broken, the index could rise to 110,000-112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
Officials say a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO said in a statement that five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the Karabakh region of the city.
The bombing is the latest act of violence in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion on Thursday evening was an attack with a "personnel-guided handmade explosive" on a joint patrol with the Afghan army.
The statement said all the wounded were in good condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram air base.
Reporters say the Taliban's growing power and the group known in Karabakh as the Islamic State (IS) is a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1,662 civilians in the first half of 2017, with an average of 20% in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shiite-majority area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a giant bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs in on whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country's military and police.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA has stopped delaying the air pollution rule after the lawsuits.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backtracked on a decision to delay an Obama-era law that requires states to curb emissions that cause dirty smoke, a day after 15 states' organizations sued the effort.
Late Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to proceed with the "2015 Ozone Decisions", saying the agency was committed to working with states.
EPA Chairman Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them".
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA intended to delay ozone decisions by a year until October 2018, with these decisions measuring current dirty smoke pollution in various parts of the country and deciding where cuts would be necessary to meet more stringent air quality standards.
Fifteen states, mostly Democrats, and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump continues to seek to roll back the wide range of environmental regulations put in place by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump calls reviving economic growth.
But these efforts have drawn a backlash from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the public health effects of more emissions.
Breathing ozone-containing air "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma", says the EPA's website.
The forest brought good news...
It's time for the stop and wing transfer!
Beşiktaş President Fikret Orman has made statements to Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and the stoper.
The thought forest said...
There's no surprise in the transfer.
We're not looking for a lot of transfers, we're looking for a point shot.
Now we're gonna do a stop and a wing transfer.
We have Champions League games, hopefully we'll draw a good draw.
We have to do a forced wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don't have that kind of budget.
If it comes to our budget, we'll transfer, if not, we're not dead.
I can't tell you anything until we get the lens cleared up.
We're a public company.
The end of patience is peace.
Is there an ISIS threat only for August 30th, or is there no festival?
Reactions to the Ankara Governor's ban on sit-ins, memorial gatherings and similar mass events throughout August, including concerts, continue on the grounds of "ISIS threat".
The governor's ban includes the phrase "all mass activities" and the 7th district of Ankara.
The Grand Ankara International Festival is underway.
CHP Group Vice President and Ankara MP Levent Gök, in a statement to SÖZCÜ, said "there can be no question of 30 August being affected by the bans" and said:
He's got a serious headache.
The governor's hesitating on which decision to implement...
The state's job is to create the space for celebrations.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said "All of Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations have no security problem".
Ankara Independent MP Aylin Nazlıaka has moved the ban to the Parliament.
Nazlıaka, who proposed the Prime Minister's response, said, "Does this ban not clearly show the Republican and Ataturk hostility of the AKP?
"I learned from Edwina herself that I was being cheated on".
Demet Shener, who is still in divorce proceedings with Ibrahim Kutluay, was in Nisantashi with his lawyer Aslı Hatemi the day before.
Schener, who filed a spiritual compensation lawsuit against Edwina Sponza, who he claimed destroyed his nest, had presented photos of Sponza and Kutluay taken together as evidence to the court.
The socialite Sponza had also filed a complaint against Shener, saying, "Demet illegally seized my private photos".
'I Didn't Know How to Swear'
After this latest development, Shener, who was meeting with his lawyer in the Nişantaşı Delicatessen, saw the journalists and left the venue.
When she was reminded of Edwina Sponza's claim about the photos, the cheerful Shener laughed and said, "Oh my God, I must have broken into your house and taken it".
Asli Hatemi also said about Sponza's complaint, "There is such a complaint, but the content is not true".
"We have everything; we have presented it to the court", he said.
Shener, the press was saying, "Lately, everyone knew about your wife's affair with Sponza".
"How did you not know?" he asked, much to his surprise.
- What?
How's that?
"I swear I didn't know", said Shana, "was I to believe my husband staring me in the eye, or the gossip of the people?"
"I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time", Shener said, after first saying "No" to the journalists' insistence that "Have you never heard it?"
But I didn't believe in any of that.
Everything was normal, everything was in order, nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, I learned all about it when you sent it to me, so new...
"Was it Sponza who sent the evidence?" Shener answered "Yes" and confused them, claiming that Sponza had sent him the photos and correspondence he had presented to the court.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was a montage.
Beşiktaş will sign with Negredo tomorrow.

Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Trade Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said he wanted to express his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "Thank you very much for your honorable attitude and support for us".
I also send greetings from the Emir of Qatar to my brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Qatari economy has proven resilient.
Our economy is strong, while many other countries' economies are being adversely affected.
We must do everything we can to make Qatar independent and strong.
Thanks to Turkey, we broke the embargo against us in a matter of hours.
We're not short of anything right now.
Our natural resources, our natural gas exports, are a major contributor to Qatar's economy.
We were not affected by the blockade that was brutally imposed on us and against the law, thanks to Turkey.
Today, Qatar is once again producing natural gas and LNG worldwide.
"After what happened, we have not seen a decline in our natural gas exports, but a 30 percent increase", he said.
Al Thani said that the brotherly relations between Qatar and Turkey and the work in all areas is continuing.
Recent decisions have played a role in this.
As Turkish products have proven themselves in the Qatari market, accelerating the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors, investing in many areas is extremely important for us.
"I thank you very much for your constructive attitude toward us", he said.
The cost of the recent disasters is 300 million TL
TSB Chairman Can Akın Çağlar said that after the flood of July 18, 7 thousand damages of 116 million TL were reported to insurance companies, 800 damages of 12 million liras were reported in the earthquake of 21 July in Gökova and 22 thousand damages of 168 million liras were reported in the flood and hail in Istanbul on July 27.
"The damage caused by the flood is around 3 thousand 500 liras per vehicle, and the damage to the glass is around a thousand liras".
"In the earthquake, the average damage to the housing is 6 thousand liras".
He said that three out of four people do not have housing insurance, one out of two businesses does not have fire insurance and two out of three people do not have helmet insurance.
Because of the low insurance rates in our country, the risk of our citizens and institutions facing serious damage costs is increasing day by day.
These costs should not be left entirely on the state.
Insurance policies aren't as expensive as they seem, and insurance isn't just a loss-paying industry; it's also a risk management consultancy.
Increasing insurance awareness and insurance coverage is vital to our people and our country.
"The general conditions of the Kasko insurance state that insured persons must report their damage within 5 working days, and this period ended yesterday".
"Will the insured be a victim?" he answered: "Although in general terms there is such a period, the statute of limitations in the Commercial Law is 2 years".
"Also, these events are a natural disaster, so insured people don't have to panic, no company will say I don't pay".
That's how the German media saw the giant bidding!
At a time when the difficulties between Turkey and Germany are increasing, the German Siemens company won the first tender for the Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resource Areas (YEKA) in Turkey.
German media reported the development with the words "The giant tender in Turkey was won by German Siemens".
DWelle said in Turkish that the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon consortium won the tender for the YEKA.
"The tender for the creation of a 1,000 megawatt wind energy capacity has the distinction of being Turkey's first YEKA tender", the report said, adding that the number of companies competing in the tender has dropped from 8 to 2.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak made a statement after the tender, and made striking statements about Turkey-Germany relations.
The auction was won by the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message for the region and the world.
I think this result will make a significant contribution to Turkish-German relations, considering the 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany.
I am proud to show that Turkey is one of the most reliable countries in the region and the world to invest in, no matter how many regional crises there are in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible match.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cross paths to stage the most satisfying boxing match of the near future for the 147 pound six, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, was in separate rooms at ESPN's offices in Los Angeles until he walked down the hall and greeted World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
In a Saturday vote on Showtime, both fighters are among the top five members of the cycling un-watch list after Garcia defeated former world champion four-wheeler Adrien Broner.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you".
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7:00 on ESPN.
While the pair posed for photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential matchup between the fighters would be "of the perfect size".
Garcia made the "I'm an old feathered chicken" reminder.
"I've gained 140 pounds for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get off the light bike.
He should switch to a lightweight bike, then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko has joined.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be a pay-and-watch; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer and having Lomachenko fight in a 135 pound opening match this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell bout for the lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
Garcia said, "The fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans want it", and then stated that he was open to which channel offered the best financial package.
We're the main names.
No other name is as interesting.
When they're ready"...
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and would be able to attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant to give Garcia a round of congratulations, saying he thought the three-time cycling champion from Riverside looked "too slow", "sorry, Mikey... you asked for the knockout".
Garcia said the focus was on punching first, then boxing.
Both said they felt the momentum was building for their encounters.
"This is a fight that must be fought.
No other fight will generate this much attention and buzz.
Garcia said, "I'm very happy to be involved".
Lomachenko said, "I was expecting the best fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
Turkish Resti from Russia to America
The White House is not considering sanctions that would affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of those lines.
And the reason for that is the cost of borrowing is going up.
The Kremlin, concerned that Western investment partners might consider pulling out of the projects due to sanctions, has in return accelerated the construction of the pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is building the Turkish Stream line that is planned to reach Turkey from under the Black Sea, has accelerated construction at Gazprom's request.
Reuters wrote that Gazprom has also begun construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "with urgency" in order to export more gas to Europe.
New results of Sweden's refugee age assessment test released
The latest results of evaluation tests on refugees undergoing a new medical age assessment in Sweden found that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were over 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden's national forensic and pharmaceutical authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make age assessments more accurate during the asylum process, following criticism of the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) for its failure to assess the correct age of some refugees who claim to be underage.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing and the Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals Department has now released the results of a total of 2481 from the testing period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
In 80 percent of cases (as of 2002) the judge ruled that the victim was 18 or older, and in 25 cases the Medical Examiner's Office ruled that the victim was "probably 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests were only done in cases where the age of the person was suspected.
Johan Göransson from the Forensics and Pharmaceutical Department says the results are consistent with the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics from the last few months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local.
The high rate of cases of people convicted over the age of 18 doesn't necessarily mean that refugees lie about their age.
In May, the department released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases where "indicated subjects were 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of 581 reported cases, it found that 243 cases clearly declared that they had turned 18 this year.
The medical method of age assessment, which involves X-raying 20-year-old teeth and performing MRI scans of knee joints, then having them analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute who has also studied the biological maturity of humans, assessing whether they enter the age of puberty earlier or later than normal.
"I have reason to think about it, and I think that this is not the kind of measurement that should be used.
It's highly questionable to judge biological age in this way.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend to be".
However, Göransson of the Department of Forensic Medicine and Pharmaceuticals defended the validity of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being wrongly judged to be an adult is small.
The highest risk is for people under 18, in which case the risk is around 10 percent".
Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque is opening today
The Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdulhamit in 1885 for architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for worship with Friday prayers after restoration work.
Regional Director Mürsel Sari said that the restoration work started in June 2013 was completed and the mosque was ready for opening.
"The restoration work was carried out in two areas".
The first phase was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was the environmental planning.
In the first part, about 16 million liras were spent, and for environmental regulation, about 11 million liras.
First the wooden dome's bullets were opened, after they were renovated, the outer walls were cleaned of dirt, external factors, rust.
Drainage for the reinforcement has been done.
As you can see when we enter the mosque, it's richly decorated.
It's a work with star motifs, and it's very rich in pencil work.
There's a mixed style here.
"The traces of the Seljuk are also visible, and if we consider that it was built in the Ottoman and 1885s, the Baroque style is also starting to be a factor in the architecture".
There is a problem with Abdulhamit.
"The German Emperor II in the center of the mosque".
It was partially damaged, repaired, cleaned, and hung in place.
It's a really valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages, symmetrical on either side of the mosque, which we call greetings.
We know that these were made by our great khan Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we know that he made these things with his own hands and put them together here.
They're still standing here in their original state.
Sarı said that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was expected to attend the opening ceremony.
Pantic's claim in Göztepe
Ukrainian media reported that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer, who could not get into the squad at Dinoma Kiev, could be loaned to the yellow-red club.
Pantic started his career with the Serbian national team Red Star, and has also played in Spain for Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves.
Pantic signed for Dynamo Kiev in the middle of last season.
The governor of West Virginia announced he's changing his party.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night that he would be changing his party at a rally with President Trump.
Governor Justice said, "Like it or not, the Democrats have left me".
"Today, I will tell you with much prayer and thought... "I will tell you today as a West Virginian,
The rally was drowned in cheers.
Justice added, "So tomorrow I'm changing my registration to Republican".
"If I was the technical director, I'd tell you it's time to play a different game".
Mr. Trump promised to make a major announcement earlier at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and the Democratic nominee Justice did not endorse Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he inherited his coal business from his father, and he owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Convention issued a statement Thursday night saying "Gov. Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party that prefers to work to prevent it than make our country great again".
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS, "With only 15 governors and the fewest state legislatures in history in control, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from head to toe and fails to find a positive, unifying message".
I will do what is best for Turkey.
Olympic third, Turkey record holder.
He was born in Cuba but he chose Turkey as his homeland...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national uniform...
First he became European champion, then Olympic third...
And now one of Turkey's most important medal hopes at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, who competes in the 400m hurdles, spoke to the morning before the championship, which starts today.
When you were young, they didn't want you in Cuba because they didn't like your rank.
You've improved on your coaching.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some people think you chose Turkey for the money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was leaving the national team.
And from that moment on, I can say that I drew a line in the sand.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
I got into the national team thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They made me an offer for backup.
I've started a new chapter with Turkey.
I had a lot of disabilities in my youth, but after the opportunities I had in Turkey, I had some great successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can't wait to do my best at the World Championships and win a different title.
You cried at the press conference the other day.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever I get asked about Turkey's sponsorship, I think back to my childhood, when I was 23 years old, I wanted to be kicked out of the Cuban national team.
And of course, people in Turkey are coming to me.
I felt the same way when I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, when the anthem of independence was played.
I couldn't hold back my tears.
I also thank Turkey for giving me the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I'm very happy to be part of the Turkish National Team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said before that you might have a Turkish girlfriend.
You're with a Turk, you went to Cuba together.
You want to share your experience?
The greatest advantage of being with a Turk is the calmness...
Compared to the Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls are in charge of their relationships.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You're together all day, does it interfere with your eating?
He eats more sweets than I do.
(Laughter) I'm not really on a strict diet, but it gets in my food from time to time.
My trainer Massimo Matrone often gives me tough warnings about my diet, but I know it's for my own good.
How's your Turkish food? Does your boyfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook very well, but my boyfriend does it better.
(Laughter) Dried beans and rice is my first choice.
I just laughed at him.
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He had other kids in my place.
After winning medals for Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He looked at me, pointed me at the young athletes next to him, and said, "Look, I raised him".
I just laughed at him.
My beauty my anger
I wonder what you wear in the races.
I just use it for concentration.
The moment I put on my glasses, I cut myself off from the world and build a wall on either side of me.
I'm just focused on the finish line and I can't see anything else.
When we say Tokyo 2020, what comes to mind?
I'm not going to...
She won the gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles at the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 35.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33.
Turkish is a supporter
Ismail All, Deputy General Manager of Turkcell, said that they believe that Yasmani Capello will be successful in London, saying, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in the best way in this championship".
We wish all our athletes success in London.
"We will continue to support Turkish athletics to further develop and achieve greater success for our country", he said.
Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for the doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised Russia's "sincere apology" over the doping scandal, but stressed that the time was not right for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics patron Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to "all athletes who were forcibly stripped of their gold and silver medals at the competitions".
Despite its assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
IAAF president Coe told reporters, "I think today was a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation".
"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted itself, that it had overcome the most turbulent days and that it had done everything possible to ensure the reconstruction of the Federation"...
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted his re-admission criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's on track, but Congress supports the task force's proposal that it's not the right time to return Russia's rights", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to seek to separate clean athletes from the flawed system".
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete as neutral at the World Athletics Championships starting Friday in London.
IAAF task force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia had not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
He told reporters after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London that the drug test was still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still working freely.
Denial of the US 'tank to YPG' news
The US Embassy in Ankara said that no tanks were given to any of the parties fighting in Syria.
The allegations that hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG were denied.
The statement from the embassy, titled "Statement on false news in the press about the Tirs going to Syria", said:
In a series of false reports in the press over the past few days, it has been falsely claimed that the US has sent hundreds of trucks full of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not supplied any tanks to any group fighting against Daesh in Syria.
Much of the US military aid, primarily light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAC) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
Syrian Arabs, including the SAC, are fighting to clear the area of Dea and return to their homes.
TYDTA Chairman Ermut: Direct foreign investment is higher than last year
TYDTA Chairman Arda Ermut said that 55 percent of all investment came after July last year.
Ermut said that investment did not decrease due to the coup attempt on July 15 but increased.
Perhaps if these conditions had not been met, if some regional developments had not taken place, we would have seen a much greater increase with a dramatic impact.
That makes us more hopeful for next year.
Hopefully, it'll be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
We're already up 11% in the first five months compared to the first five months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more", he said.
"It's not that global or regional developments are not worrying us", Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that normally up to 2010, 75 percent of direct investments came from Europe.
That number has dropped to 66 percent.
Again, Asia's share has gone from 2 percent to 7 to 8 percent.
Russia's share has increased.
And while we were trying to do that, the Gulf countries had some problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two important players.
But the problem between these two countries is a cause for concern and it's causing investors to delay their decision a little longer.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, but we may be experiencing some delays because of this.
Arda Ermut reminded that there were some events in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has reacted clearly and decisively to this situation.
When they spoke to investors in countries experiencing the most severe political crisis, the reaction of President Erdogan was, "Look, problems happen between governments, definitely not between people".
Second, these people came and invested in my country.
These are no different to us than Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they come to us, we solve it.
"We will definitely not allow them to be victims".
"We can guarantee that in the future".
You will see that neither German companies nor investors from countries where we have some political problems will have any problems.
On the contrary, I hope we will do our best to increase investment from these countries.
We think the investment coming in from here will continue to grow.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions of the investment environment.
"But we will do our best to ensure that neither our investors nor the investment environment is affected".
TYDTA Chairman Ermut said that after the One Generation One Road strategy, Turkey has started to see great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are solved, they expect the largest investment from the Gulf.
"There is not a single investor in the relations with Germany who says, 'We had trouble because of these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we are running away.' " Ermut said that there are companies that are coming, coming and following.
"Right now, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies", Ermut said.
So almost 10 percent of the companies we've interviewed from around the world are German companies.
Some of these are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's either gonna increase his investment or he's got a theme, and that's still open as a project.
"So German companies are still a significant part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut stressed that all state institutions should be careful during the periods of perception operations in Turkey, and said that the issue is sensitive and can be affected by the slightest bad communication.
Ermut said that the past 2-3 weeks have been a good lesson.
Investors and politicians have different agendas.
We've always seen that economic relations always make political developments somehow work.
Germany will continue to be an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
The election agenda in Germany is unfortunately increasing this kind of rhetoric.
I think once they're gone, things will be a little better.
And in particular, Saudi Arabia, both countries are careful not to make negative statements.
After all, an investor who invests in Turkey is investing in all the markets of the surrounding countries.
So there was a bit of a slowdown, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region.
But we're still in talks with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision that they might be able to make sooner.
We don't have any Saudi investors who say, 'I see uncertainty in the negative because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I'm leaving here.'
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who still live in Turkey, who are on holiday here and who also meet with us, we follow the whole process.
Arda Ermut, recalling that the international direct investment (IDI) that came to Turkey last year was 12.3 billion dollars, said, "I think this year we will definitely surpass it.
"But how far we go, these regional developments, global uncertainties will affect", he said.
Ermut, who said he hoped the impact would be more, but maybe a little more limited, said that the first 5 months were 11 percent higher, and that this could be maintained, adding, "I hope there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the end of the year better than last year".
Ermut said that a significant part of the investments will continue to be in real estate, adding that new investments could be seen in logistics, health, fintech, information technology, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing.
Ermut stressed that they will announce new investments in the coming months, "We may have an investment announcement in the manufacturing sense soon".
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
"There could be investments from interested countries".
Operation on 4 wine firms in 9 provinces: 55 detained
The teams of the Istanbul Directorate of Combating Smuggling Crimes found that the foil covering of the mushroom cap on the products sold by four wine companies was long and loose and the bandrollers were not glued to the bottle, the TAPDK bandrollers were collected after the products were sold and were marketed by gluing them to newly produced wines.
The investigation team has suggested that the state has lost 20 million 400 thousand liras in taxes due to the repeated use of bandrels by the suspects.
Police teams conducted simultaneous operations at 55 addresses where four wine companies have factories and warehouses in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirdag, Bursa, Balıkesir, Manisa, Aydın, Denizli and Nevşehir.
In total, 55 people were detained in the operation, while 15 thousand ready-to-sell wine, 52 thousand 480 bottles of wine filled with TAPDK bandroll caps were seized, 12 thousand 890 TAPDK bandroll caps, 3 pistols and bullets, 100 boxes of sexual pills, 992 smuggled cigars, 698 bottles of various types of counterfeit liquor and 100 liters of aniseed essence.
The 55 people were brought to the Directorate of the Office of Combating Illicit Trafficking in Persons.
Suspects are still in the security detail.
His team's operations on factories, warehouses and workplaces were captured on police cameras.
Police teams searched a warehouse and found him removing the lids from wine bottles ready for sale.
The police team has been investigating the TAPDK bandrolled hoods, which are filled with bags of used bottles.
How will football's financial rules affect Neymar's trip to Paris?
Rules to prevent unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Barcelona, Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France.
From UEFA, the governing body that oversees European football, to Paris Saint-Germain, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament, any outcome can be expected.
The Financial Fair Play rules issued by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that they financed Neymar's transfer without incurring huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of contract, and Neymar will command a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France are:
Given the team's money from an energy-rich Qatari family, PSG could of course pay for Neymar's signing and adding him to the galaxy of other stars.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on players, but they have to balance that with legitimate revenue sources, so long as they get their foot in the door.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were in huge debt in pursuit of success were effectively fraudulent and at risk of bankruptcy if the banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP began to monitor club losses rather than focus on debts.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 (take a club with potential, spend heavily to improve the team and build a global brand) was transformed into a more challenging venture.
During the three-year FFP evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can lose 30 million euros.
Despite Platini's disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksander Cefer, is still determined to avoid overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who runs the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules by moving forward".
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchase price in full, due to accounting reasons, the amount can be spread over the contract period.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP restrictions in 2014 saw the heaviest restrictions imposed on Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million, and ordered to limit their Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season, instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is on the alert against clubs that may try to defraud financial regulators by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the club's owners.
While a Qatari company may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow this to be considered as a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority had overstated PSG's sponsorship.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings from PSG could come through payments to Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied Neymar will be an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, and such a move could easily be revealed by UEFA organisers.
The past sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more wary of attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to people familiar with the matter, UEFA is not in a preventive discussion with PSG regarding Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss PSG's situation.
The latest published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, gift and uniform sales.
The club expects the circus to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league, which is clearly upset by the departure of one of football's greatest players, has tried to block Neymar's departure on the grounds that PSG is in breach of the FFP.
La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS that Qatar is the definitive owner of PSG, saying: "This is an open 'financial doping' case with the club and the state".
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday: "It's a result of owning and it has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years".
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
Financial Fair Play is very difficult to respect because for a country such a big player to represent a country can lead to different methods or different interests.
Insurers are rioting over the ceiling price
According to TSB data, the insurance industry has been losing money in the traffic sector since 2006.
The sector, which lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015, made a profit of only 19 million TL in 2016.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Sigorta and Güneş Sigorta are trading on the stock exchange.
Speaking at the meeting where the results of the first six months of 2017 of the TSB were evaluated, Çağlar said that the loss in traffic insurance for 11 years reached 7.3 billion TL, and they estimate that the loss of the sector this year will increase to 2.3 billion TL, with the application of the ceiling premium.
Chaglar, who said that the 2015 figure will be caught this year, pointed out that the loss recorded in 2012 and 2015 also took the profit of other branches, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we increase the price of the citizen's housing policy".
"75 percent of the sector is foreign, our partners abroad are also in a sense financing the bad driver", he said.
The ages, they went on:
We don't expect to make a profit on traffic, but looking at the last 11 years, we've never shown a profit.
"We accept that, but we hope that we can cover the damage in a reasonable environment, along with other policies".
Chaglar said that there were dramatic price increases when the loss in traffic took away the profitability of other products, "In 2012, there were price increases in traffic insurance of around 30 percent, in 2015 it became almost doubled, we recorded the largest loss in our history".
"Even in an environment where prices have increased so much, at the end of 2016 our profit in traffic was only 19 million TL", he said.
"We will lower the price of the good driver in the free fare and apply a high price to the bad driver".
"But the Treasury is looking at the general trend, and the final word on when is with the Treasury", he said.
The Treasury Department has implemented the maximum premium (ceiling price) from April 12, stating that the increase in compulsory traffic insurance premiums since 2015 has affected a wide section of society.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance policies were determined on the basis of each group of vehicles, the level and traffic density and accident statistics.
On the other hand, as of July, the "Risk Insurance Pool" was implemented for high-frequency damage or vehicle groups in compulsory traffic insurance.
The premiums and damages for the pool's traffic insurance policies will be split between the insurance companies.
The premiums of these policyholders will be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Chaglar said that with the application of the ceiling premium, the premium production in traffic in the first 6 months of 2017 decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, taking into account inflation, the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 percent.
Chaglar, who said that traffic will take profits in other branches again this year, said, "This loss cannot be sustained with these ceiling prices.
How much more damage can the sector bear?"
Chaglar, who said that all companies in the sector have 9 billion TL in capital, and that the sector's capital will be finished in three years when only 2.3 billion TL is lost from traffic, "foreigners are looking at 'Why does a good driver finance a bad driver, why do my thousands of shareholders finance a bad driver in Turkey?'"
"We're trying to tell the Treasury about our problem at this point", he said.
When asked if foreigners have reached the point of reducing their weight in the Turkish insurance sector, Çağlar said, "They have not yet reached that point".
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, the average policy is 6 per capita, while in Turkey it is 1.3.
"So Turkey is a place that really needs to grow", he said, and continued:
So they haven't given up on this place.
But even though the company makes a reasonable profit every year, he keeps all the profits and uses them to grow the company.
According to TSB data, in 2016, the premium production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL, while in the first half of this year it was 23.1 billion TL, an increase of 12 percent compared to the same period last year.
Chaglar said he estimates the industry will not complete the year with a 15 percent growth in total premium production.
Social assistance is good news for thousands of chronic patients
The details and implementation of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Struggling with Chronic Diseases" that began work a while ago on the instructions of the Minister of Family and Social Policies Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya were revealed.
The social assistance program for poor citizens and their families will benefit 4,300 TB and SSPE patients in the first phase.
Patients will be provided with monthly allowance of over two-thirds of the minimum wage, as well as regular psychosocial support.
The Ministry will also pay additional payments to tuberculosis patients who are unable to afford medical care, are bedridden or who are in need of home improvement.
Payments will be made through Social Assistance Cards, which will be provided through PTT.
Those who cannot go to the bank due to geographical circumstances, illness, disability, etc. will be paid at the door.
The program is also a world first in many respects.
One in 10 companies that invest is still German.
The head of the Turkish Investment Support and Promotion Agency of the Prime Minister's Office, Arda Ermut, said that the political tension between the two countries does not reflect the business world that German companies in Turkey are seen as Turkish companies.
Ermut said, "There is not a single investor in relations with Germany who says, 'We have suffered because of this situation and we are fleeing.'"
"About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are German companies", Ermut said.
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
"Germans are an important part of our daily workflow", he said.
Ermut said that Abraaj Group's partnership with the logistics company Netlog is a good example of this.
Omar Syed, a partner at Abraaj Group, pointed to the economic growth in Turkey and said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey".
Ozer, on the way to becoming the last Ottoman
The management has given him two weeks to find a club and the experienced footballer has agreed with Osmanlıspor.
At the beginning of last season, four hours before the end of the transfer window, Özer Hurmacı signed a contract with the green-and-black club until 2019, and he made a significant contribution to the team with 5 goals and 4 assists in 29 league and 2 cup matches.
The board, which blocked Ozer's return, signed Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday to replace him.
The transfer of the century has taken place!
Barcelona announced that Neymar has been transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of 222 million euros.
The transfer development, which has been followed with great enthusiasm by the football community, has become official.
PSG added the star to their roster by paying the Catalan side 222 million euros for the Brazilian player, the player's release fee.
Neymar, with this bonus fee, became the most expensive transfer in football history.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the French Ligue 1 announced that they have signed Brazilian star Neymar to a five-year contract.
The club's website said that Neymar, 25, who is the world's most expensive player, has signed a contract with PSG until June 30, 2022.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to wear the shirt for the French team, adding: "Since I started my football career in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most challenging and ambitious teams".
"The reason I joined this club is to win as many trophies as our fans want".
PSG will pay Neymar 45 million euros for each season.
So the cost of the star player will cost the French representative over 400 million euros.
The strike of the seamen ended with a raise
The agreement on the increase in the collective contract between İzmir Metropolitan Municipality's company IZDENIZ A.Ş. and the Turkish Seafarers' Union (TDS) was not reached.
The workers of the union, IZDENIZ, went on strike on July 12.
The strike, which lasted for almost a month, ended today at 15:00 after the workers were given a raise.
According to the collective employment agreement signed, the salary of the ground staff of the IZDENIZ will be increased by 12 percent.
The salary of the IZDENIZ, which has renewed its fleet, has increased by 25 percent, with the income tax exemption obtained after registration in the International Ship Register, and the rate of increase accepted for personnel in the status of a sailor is 5 percent.
The General Directorate of the IZDENIZ announced that flights in the inner bay will continue with normal fare, flights to Yassıcaada will start from Tuesday, and flights to Foça and Urla will start from the end of next week.
TDS Chairman Hasan Pekdemir said that the strike has been going on for 23 days and that the traffic has been blocked.
The strike has improved the rights of our workers on land and at sea.
We're happy to leave the table.
The average sailor will have a 28 percent share, and the average sailor on land will have a 20 percent share.
We had friends who worked at the minimum wage.
We've made some serious improvements in their pay.
Nostalgia is in the air with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective".
So, for the characters' glory days in the '80s, for the grunge era in the '90s (when minds like David Wain and Michael Showalter did the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for himself in 2001, before his stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to bigger things, this version of the story is all nostalgic.
As a cultural product, it's both a tease and a personification of our age of Facebook, which is forever remembered.
But as a series, it's like it's out of date.
"First Day of Camp" was an unexpected success, and not just because of its absurd humor (it included a story about the origins of a talking box plant, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By focusing on the basic comedy (middle-aged actors playing adolescent children), he realized the impossibility of recapturing the past episode of the joke.
Now, "Ten Years Later", where the adults play the adults, is less emotionally based and more casual, including a monologue about a perverted cult film from the '90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook, some single-wheeled skates, and "a lot of other stuff from 1991".
Most of the main stories are the same.
Coop, a soft-hearted writer, still hasn't forgotten about Katie.
Victor hasn't lost his virginity yet.
And now there is another insane treacherous plot, instigated by George H. W. Bush (a very well-placed imitation by Michael Ian Black) and involving Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter).
As always, the best part of the series is the interjection.
Especially the ever-young Mr. Rudd with the lip-stained beard from Matt Dillon's "The Bachelor", whose Andy, the most popular kid in his old school, now looks like an old man.
There are some random moments of madness that power this series (like the kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series) until it comes to what I think is the logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where the final scene is about a group of friends going to see the premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
Meanwhile, Comrade Detective on Amazon is appealing to a different kind of nostalgia: The Americans' Cold War revival, the movie "Blonde Bomb" and even "GLOW" with its iconography of the East against the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy seems like found TV: a 1980s Romanian police buddy drama about two Bucharest police officers fighting for the real, atheist and Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by Gregor the wolf and idealist Joseph, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with English dubbing of their dialogue by Channing Tatum (who is also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some pretty visual comedies.
And the cast of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, makes for a good game of guess-who's voice.
But Comrade Detective is so dedicated to making a clumsy propaganda drama look like reality (including a killer in a Reagan mask), he often plays exactly like it.
Six long episodes can't be passed and the comedy isn't fast enough or often enough.
While Gregor and Joseph are constantly visiting the American embassy, where two fat men are always eating a bunch of hamburgers in their lobby like hungry wolves, "Comrade Detective" could have done a better job of propaganda if it had been shortened to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist viewer is that Western culture can turn anything into a serial eating disorder.
The Romanian inventors were not wrong: we are doing this to our own recent past and even to theirs.
FETÖ's ancestor is Kadıanlı
The British government has seen through 50 years of experience that our family is loyal and dedicated.
The highest offices of government have long recognized the loyalty and service of this family to the British Government.
It is incumbent upon the British Government to act wisely and carefully in regard to this seed planted by their own hands, to investigate and examine everything and to decide carefully.
In trying to understand FETÖ, the starting point is the organization of Hashashis, but an essential difference is forgotten, that FETÖ is an organization that emerged in the imperialist period and operated with colonial aims.
I think the first move that needs to be made is the Kadyanis.
In the English praise in the introduction, the person who describes himself as 'the seed planted by the hands of the British Government' is the founder of Kadıyanlık, Mirza Gulum Ahmet Kadıyanı.
Ghulam Ahmed, born in Kadayan, a small town in the Punjab province of India, reported that on December 1, 1888, Allah commanded him to take a bead from his followers and form a separate congregation.
Ghulam Ahmed went a little further and said that according to the revelation and inspiration he received in 1891, Jesus died a natural death like other prophets, that Allah sent him as the Messiah and Mahdi, whom Christians and Muslims were waiting for.
Accordingly, the Messiah that Muslims expect is the same person as the Mahdi, and that is Mirza Ghulam Ahmed Kaddiyani.
(Islamic Encyclopedia) The Bible is a book of wisdom.
Ghulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending persecuted Muslims against Hindus and Christians in India, which came under British rule after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, recalls Gülen's portrait of defending Islam against atheism as the President of the Society for Combating Communism in Erzurum, which was supposedly founded entirely by Sakhatists but later came to be supported by the CIA.
Like Gulen, Ghulam Ahmed's most beloved idea among imperialists is that "jihad" is a Muslim's struggle only with himself and that imperialism has no dimension to be fought if you can live your religion freely.
Remember, Gülen even went a step further, praising the Crusader attacks, which are still scarred by history, in a sermon last year: "It is not too dangerous for the Crusader to invade your country.
Because there are red lines between you and them.
Once they're not attached to your wife, your daughter.
They don't belong in your temple, you unattached crusaders!
The idea that the Mahdi and Christianity are united in him, the idea that his own community will be the savior of Islam, the similarity of the theses to FETO, as the concept of jihad means only the struggle with the soul, the way Kadyanism spread also took place in the field of education and civil society in general.
The total number of Kadyanite centers in the world, which are said to have over 2 million 'doctors', is 1869, the number of countries where the emergency relief organization "Humanity First" is officially registered is 23.
The data also includes 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, eight Kadyan printeries in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries, and some 16,000 mosques worldwide.
We can see more clearly the depth of the approval of Kadhafi by global powers, considering that Prof. Abdussalam, the "first Muslim scientist" to receive the Nobel Prize, Sir Zaferullah Khan, who became President of the United Nations Court of Justice, and Mahershala Ali, the "first Muslim actor to receive an Oscar", are also Kadhafians.
Let's note that the women's rally in the UK last week with 30,000 people was also polished as a body show.
A brief look at their history is enough to understand that the Kadyanis, whose slogan is "Love everyone, hate no one", actually meant "love your invaders/colonizers".
It is possible to trace the starting point and motivations of structures like the Hulasa, FETO or Tahir-ul-Qadri back to the Kadyani and all these organizations are actually supported as a target to corrupt societies in order to give a gateway to imperialism and serve colonialism.
The last wish came out of the cargo.
Emily Pomeranz, 50, who spent her final days in a hospital in Washington after suffering from pancreatic cancer, said she missed a coffee and chocolate milkshake at a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of the woman contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has run the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and paid the $123 fee to send it to a hospital 600 kilometers away in a "fast delivery" shipment.
Ahmet Kul has two new projects
Ahmet Kul İnşaat, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Autoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has put its Dia Mare in Mimaroba, Istanbul, and Solse 7 in Yalıkavak, Bodrum, on sale.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by architect Çamoğlu Arkitek, was developed to get maximum benefit from the sea.
Dia Mare is located on an area of 11,000 square meters and has a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The project, which is fully completed, will be handed over to the new owners in March 2018.
There are many types of apartments in Dia Mare, ranging from 2+1 to 5+1.
The company will start two new construction projects in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, and in 2018 it is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapi.
He transferred 753 million to affiliated companies.
Barış Yarkadaş said that many programs were made outside the TRT where 6 thousand 760 personnel work and were paid at inflated prices.
The CHP deputy has again withdrawn the nation's taxes to AKP companies in "TRT 2016".
He said, "It's called robbery".
The source that TRT has transferred to affiliated production companies was revealed with data obtained from official documents.
The official response to the application of CHP Istanbul MP Barış Yarkadaş under the Law on Information has shown how TRT's resources are being spent.
Yarkadaş said that despite all the technical possibilities, the TRT, where 6 thousand 760 people work as personnel, transferred 753 million 500 thousand TL to affiliated companies in 2016 through programs made under the name of external production.
The CHP deputy used the phrase "The meaning of this is emphasized".
"The production companies of the AKP journalists and businessmen are looting TRT".
"Millions are being paid for unseen or unseen productions", he said.
Yarkadaş recalled that the money transferred to companies was collected from the taxes of the people, "The institution with 7 thousand employees has become the apple of the AKP".
"What programs did these companies sign that 7,000 people couldn't do and get this money?"
Yarkadaş said that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was 224,456,182 TL, adding that when the salaries of staff and other expenses are taken into account, advertising revenue remains a lot.
"TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, can't get advertising because it's not being watched".
Feed journalists are getting paid by TRT, they're shouting in the name of the AKP.
"And the people are carrying the burden", he said.
Yarkadaş from CHP continued: "TRT gives 660 million TL salary to the staff annually; but he gives all the work to external productions".
753.5 trillion followers have been withdrawn from TRT, the pocket of the people.
This is a disgrace.
He gave up on suicide , got down on one knee and apologized to his wife .
The incident occurred at noon today at a parking lot on the corner of Eyupoglu and Değirmen Street.
According to the information received, the residents of the area saw the citizen hanging from the 4th floor of the parking lot and reported the situation to the fire and health teams.
Firefighters arrived at the scene and opened fire on the victim, while medical personnel were waiting.
After about an hour of persuasive efforts by psychologists and police teams, Yunus G., a 34-year-old father of three who gave up on suicide, knelt before his wife N.G. who watched him in tears.
On the other hand, on the street where Yunus G. was found, about 100 people sat on the sidewalks and watched the situation, while some citizens registered with mobile phones.

My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from ignorance, and from the heart that fears not, and from the prayer that is not answered, and from the soul that is not satisfied, and from hunger, which is an evil companion, and from treachery, which is an evil confidentiality, and from slothfulness, and from cowardice, and from greed, and from the evil of the evil plot, and from the punishment of the grave, and from the trial of life and death.

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%.
The Bank of England is expected to announce interest rates will not change soon after it eased speculation that there would be a rise in slow economic growth and moving inflation.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be "slow" as household incomes shrink and they keep interest rates flat.
Decision-makers on the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, thus calling for a smaller increase this month after weakening support for growth from slow economic growth.
The bank cut growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 in its quarterly inflation report, warning that household incomes would continue to shrink as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in the spring.
However, he signaled that interest rate increases were needed to curb Brexit-fueled inflation over the next few years, and said borrowing costs could continue to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the massive economic recovery package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank said it would end its Periodic Financing Plan, which provides cheap funding to banks, from next February but expects to provide an additional £15 billion (£115 billion in total) under the plan.
Minutes after the interest rate decision was made, the bank said: "The central estimate of the MPC is that the short-term slowdown in gross domestic product (GDP) is continuing as the contraction in real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption".
On interest rates, he stressed that "some tightening in monetary policy" might be necessary to ease inflation and would be "a little bit higher" than the market expected.
Markets are still forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stresses that any increase will be "step by step" and "limited".
According to May's forecasts, the bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared at 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8 percent in 2018.
Sterling has lost value against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4 percent to 1.11 euros.
The decision to not change came after recent growth figures, which were disappointing at 0.2% in the previous three months, eased expectations of a surge in growth, compared to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth will likely remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but the bank expects it to start to pick up slightly towards the end of the year.
While the bank says the contraction will get worse before it gets better, the latest inflation report leaves little to rejoice for households hit by rising inflation and meager wage increases.
The bank said monetary policy would not "prevent a fall in earnings" over the next few years, but it expected wages to improve "substantially" by the end of its three-year forecast.
The stronger demand for British goods as a result of the weaker pound will support the economy by offsetting some of the declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock EU referendum vote in August cut interest rates to 0.25%.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years for this to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's latest rate decision, there was growing inflationary pressure on struggling households and a demand for an interest rate increase that rose to 0.5 percent in July with three policymakers calling for an increase.
Inflation fell to 2.6 percent last month from 2.9 percent in July, but the bank said it expected it to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the overrun was "entirely" related to the weak pound against their 2% target.
Andrew Montlake, a director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given recent declines in exchange rates, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive, with lenders demanding to do business and close the year positively.
The market is looking particularly good for those nearing the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest rates, and is becoming more popular than ever in re-mortgages".
The NHS is going to prescribe the controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Following a Supreme Court battle over funding of the drug on the NHS, patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86 percent, will be made available to up to 10,000 people through a 3-year trial.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal's approval, saying the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims by local authorities that it was funding it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as a 'new and serious intervention' by Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'tipping point'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register, with more clinics joining in October and fully implemented across the UK by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a range of HIV medications that reduce the risk of contracting HIV before sex.
Trials have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough of the drugs in their body to prevent HIV infection from taking hold.
These drugs can be taken daily or up to two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will select suitable participants from men, women, transgender individuals and people whose partners are not known to have HIV status controlled with an antiretroviral therapy.
People living in the UK and registered with a GP will also be able to register for potential participation at participating local sexual health clinics.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England has signed an agreement to supply the drugs this week through an international tender.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, administered and administered on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: 'This new and serious intervention will contribute to the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in my thirty years of progress in solving one of mankind's major health problems.'
Deborah Gold, president of the National Aids Trust, said: 'This is a milestone in the fight against HIV.
If targeted correctly at those who need it and those at risk, PrEP has the potential to transform the HIV epidemic in the UK.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to a new and powerful tool, truly personally controlled and not open to a partner's negotiation, through this trial funded by the NHS in the UK, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We welcome this announcement.'
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority now is to ensure that the trial is rolled out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
With the experimental drug PrEP now available, we're on track to protect the more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV".
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'We welcome the start of the PrEP trial, and it has been delayed by months of delays and then government backing.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-altering infection.
The experiment will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now, it's important that this trial is available nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and to move us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in our society.

Two secrets of death
The daughter of former Industry and Trade Minister Ayhan Çilingiroglu, Umit Makbule Çilingiroglu (51), who was born in Washington, fell from the 19th floor of a business center in Istanbul Levent, which was also used as a hotel.
Melis Salihoğlu, 24, a student at Koç University, was also found dead in his home.
It was alleged that Salihoğlu hanged himself.
An investigation has been launched into two mysterious deaths that were subsequently ruled a suicide by the police.
'Depression is still going on'
The daughter of Turkey's first Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroglu, who served in the Nihat Erim government in 1971, Umit Makbule Çilingiroglu, born in 1966 in Washington, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler at 17.00 on 1 August.
A Kuwaiti tourist who had been staying in the 19th floor room and had seen the lifeless body of Çilingiroglu, who was not heard from for some time, informed the hotel management that an ambulance and police team had been called to the scene.
The medical team determined that Chilingiroglu died after falling from the 19th floor.
The mother, Mediha Chilingiroglu, who testified to police, said, "He was depressed recently".
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a grandson with leukemia from my other daughter.
"She was taking care of my grandson and was negatively affected by my grandson's illness", he said.
Chilingiroglu, whose body was taken to the Forensic Medical Institution, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It's being investigated whether Chilingiroglu was thrown by someone or committed suicide.
The claim of 'CANINA KIDDI'
The other suspicious death in Istanbul was in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu, 24, was found dead in his home.
The father of the girl allegedly went to her daughter's home near the school where he was unable to speak to her and her cell phone was not working.
The father found his daughter's lifeless body at home.
It was alleged that Melis, who was loved by her family, close friends and friends, hanged herself in her home.
Melis Salihoğlu's death has drowned his family and loved ones in the law.
Melis was followed by a friend on social media, "A bright sun was hitting our faces".
The green grass beneath our feet, your best friend Jack and your sister Eishan and we were having fun chasing that little plastic ball.
He shared the message "What was the need to die now".
Living the luxury life: a hanging floor and clever design tricks that transformed this tiny Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate renovation, moved into a smaller apartment in Earls Court in 2014 from a spacious house in Knightsbridge.
A flamboyant Queen Anne-style broom on the first floor, and proof of the new design that convinced Joanne not to pack.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-boyfriend on a much larger property in Knightsbridge", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be my price.
I was shown the apartment at Earl Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and I made her an offer that day".
After the first meeting, the 1,000 square foot apartment was renovated from the ground up.
Originally a one-room complex with a kitchen to access the bedroom, Joanne wanted to add a storage area and a penthouse to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows and lots of light.
That was my condition".
To this end, Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed hired Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but a place for Joanne to live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two spaces on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a hanging floor that you could stand inside.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel skeleton is quite complex", he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they could be stacked without having to bend down on top of each other.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the steels so that they would be at the right height for the function at the top or bottom".
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to have two full-size rooms on top of each other.
The old-style copper light window from Retrouvius for the hanging floor overlooks the magnificent living space below.
The mirrored gold furnishings, silver accents and old-style Serge Mouille lighting all define the design's style.
The use of mirrors adds to the space and light.
Mirrors placed at either end of the short hallway make it appear longer.
The mirrored protective panel in the kitchen gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
The mirrored units on the compound provide storage for Joanne's entire knife and fork kit and her ponytail.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spatial sense, is that you can close the kitchen when it's not in use.
Kitchens are not new.
What's unique about this is it's a garage-style door that can be lifted up.
Erfan explains the steel-reinforced polished MDF door, "We used some engineering on this".
"It's balanced, so it's really easy to slide when you push the door up".
With the wise use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 50 square feet, an extra bedroom, and an improved seating plan.
"At the end of the day, it's the living space that you sell, or the property that you value", says Erfan.
"Supposedly, a realtor will come in and make a calculation based on the seating area".
Here, they've managed to use high-quality materials to give the space a luxurious look while increasing the floor space.
"Items are things you touch, and so they help you bond emotionally at home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the power lines in the walls at home.
These things are important, but they don't shake your heart".
This is proof that with good design and increased square footage, an apartment can go from a standard thing to something quite spectacular.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens with his bonservice in Beşiktaş
At the end of the 1.5 month negotiations, he was transferred to Beşiktaş with Lens bonservice, which was initially thought to be for rent.
After intense negotiations over the past week, Lens has agreed to a five million euro bon service fee with the Black and White team.
The Dutch player, who has signed a five-year contract, will receive 2.2 million euros a year.
Beşiktaş is expected to make an official announcement regarding the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
Model Çağla Şikel and actor and singer Emre Altuğ, who have been in an on-again, off-again relationship for about 4 years, entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony with a photograph they called "the most special moment of our lives".
The couple decided to separate after seven years.
Brothers fighting over a $500 million property empire
Forty years after the dynasty founded by Italian families, two brothers are battling for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, three doors from his younger brother Paul, who has sued the Supreme Court over how to allocate property and business assets.
Paul had been trying to quit the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court was still debating the split.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties in Smith Street, Collingwood, worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since they bought a store in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain with 160 retail outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in property, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractor sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
As part of an agreement with his late father, Colin (described by Paul as "an important driving force and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns one-third.
A court filing says that means Colin owns $316 million in real estate and Paul owns $176 million.
For Paul, the division of property and cash is proving to be a contentious issue.
In her first affidavit to the court in 2015, she wrote, "The divisions proposed by Colin left him with properties that I have always considered the best".
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing took place.
The brothers also fight over who will control the current business, with Paul claiming Colin has left him out of the business.
Colin argues that's not true, but he accuses Paul of mismanaging some of his properties.
Colin says in an initial affidavit that he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority".
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and top lawyers, such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisors hired by both sides, recorded by firms including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, add to the costs of the case.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were an Italian immigrant family who had run grocery stores and liquor stores since the late 1950s and had bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They had pawned their assets to buy Colin's Collingwood estate, where the family opened their first jeans store.
Colin says that he founded Westco there "in my senior year of high school, when Paul was a little boy (about 10) ".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to leave their property to their sons in a friendly way.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court", he wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin says that when he left, Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million.
Paul says that both Luke and Mark were "displeased with the terms of their financial separation".
According to a 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the TV star's best friend, Colin tried to avoid attention despite being a former AFL club board member.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys on Friday.
Only Colin texted back, saying, "I can't say anything more because the case is in court".
"It was very, very sad that my brother Paul chose to sue me and drag our family name into court", she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to fall into the current dispute", she said, adding that she was "still hopeful about a solution".
By Friday, that hope seems to have been lost.
Colin wrote, "Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future".
Trump's new personal pen plans to curb the president's media diet.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If it does, it'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House pen will restrict the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports), in the hope of keeping his boss more stable.
A little background from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House private secretary, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem President Donald Trump plans to solve with the White House: the transfer of bad information to the president.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow through itself, whether it's on paper or through briefings, because the president would be able to make better decisions when he was given good information.
Kelly's diagnosis sounds very meaningful, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by controlling his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and he's now in the White House, still in good shape to watch TV.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, "If Trump is upset that he didn't get a fair share of media coverage, it would be productive to show him that he got a fair share of credible media outlets".
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check was to ensure that personal media consumption included a steady stream of praise".
I'll take that.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit is "under control" at any given time is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't, like that Trump tweets would be much more provocative without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about any tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his men were able to get him out of harm's way a few times, then it was worth it.
But no one could stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of competing factions, people who in any case were trying to advance their own agendas with materials they were presenting to Trump (which could be reliable or unreliable) and were promoting their own worldviews.
Politico reported in May that throughout the story, advisers tended to strategically convey suspicious information to the president.
One example that reporter Shane Goldmacher detailed was this:
"Present and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted angrily to negative press reports, particularly the bad-mouthed leaks, and has devoted himself to finding out where they came from.
That's what happened in late February when someone gave the president a hardcopy of an article from Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson's website GotNews.com, accusing private secretary Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
It didn't matter that Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he didn't provide any concrete evidence, or that he had made false accusations in the past and turned them down.
Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Private Counsel Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter were "trying to put in place a system that would manage and document the documents that Trump received".
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
He may emerge as a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulsive state and his aides are still vying for influence.
These unchangeable factors will make Kelly's task very difficult.
Crypto FETÖ"makers have come up with a special template
"The Republican Prosecutor of Izmir, Berkant Karakaya, has completed the investigation he initiated into the allegations of impropriety in the military espionage investigation and the leakage of certain information, which was conducted after a secret witness, code named Sarmaşık, said that the Chief of Staff of the Navy Command, Thumamiral Jihad Yayci, was a FETÖ member".
The review highlighted that Tumamiral Yayci was not a member of the organization, but helped the investigation authority in deciphering members of the crypto organization in the Naval Forces Command and played an active role in the fight against FETÖ.
The decision, which pointed out that the so-called martial law order was given to the Navy Command to pacify Yayci in the attempted coup on July 15, underlined that Yayci had been fighting FETÖ effectively from the first day of the coup attempt.
The non-compliance decision issued by Karakaya used the following expressions: "It is understood that the distributor has been working on the identification of crypto personnel of the Naval Forces Command through a special template for identifying FETÖ members belonging to the crypto-private services class and a special system created on 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criteria".
In the course of the judicial investigation, the prosecutor's office has determined that the publisher, who is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization and has made significant contributions to this cause, is not capable of making a presumptive assessment.
Admiral Bowman has been tried for insult before.
It turned out that FETÖ was behind it and the alleged crime was a hoax.
The former Air Pilot Corps Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that the broadcaster insulted him, turned the complaint into a document that was only in the form of an information note.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Tuggeneral Bekir Ercan Van, former Chief of General Staff Legal Advisor Colonel Muharrem Köse, former Chief of General Staff Intelligence Chief Colonel Mustafa Özsoy, former Chief of General Staff Intelligence, former Chief of Staff Mustafa Özsoy, former Chief of Staff Erkan Ağın, former Chief of Naval Staff Necmettin Aksoy, former Chief of Naval Staff Necmettin Aksoy, former Chief of Naval Staff Usf Aki, former Chief of Naval Staff Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Chief of Naval Staff Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çekiçek, former Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, and former Lieutenant Colonel Çekiç, who was also a member of the Turkish Republic of the Turkish Republic of the Republic of the Republic of Turkey.
Some members of the organization, including FETÖ fugitive Tuncay Opçin, were found to have targeted Yaycı with their social media posts before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
The travelers have crossed the ditch, returned to the 'rich neighborhood'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest landlords are once again in a fight with determined travellers who have climbed the moat dug by the council to reclaim the area outside their mansions.
Travellers parked 20 of their caravans outside Solihull's once-proper street, an area that has been referred to as the 'wealthy quarter'.
They returned from the ditch dug by the council to cut their streams, bringing horses, babies and a load of wagons, after being expelled in May.
The clever group found a gap in the defense, infiltrated their vehicles by setting a path through a section left unbarricaded.
Angry residents have sharply criticized Solihull Council, saying it is "useless in solving the problem".
An unnamed resident said: "They arrived Monday evening after being dispatched from Bentley Heath where they were throwing stones at passersby.
He should be ashamed of his council actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The Travelers were there in May, sent out, and now they're back again.
More came last night, and probably more today".
He added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to handle this with its lengthy removal decisions to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street, and I'm not happy to keep paying my taxes when the council can't even stop it.'
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'Jokingly, we saw the last group of travelers just leaving and were immediately devastated by a new group.
The numbers had increased this time and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.'
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the Streetsbrook Street site and are beginning the legal process to remove them as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is vital that as many residents as possible call 101 to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help to paint a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to the court.'
Galatasaray reported Ndiaye to the stock exchange
According to the statement sent to Borsa Istanbul from Galatasaray Sportif Sınai ve Ticari Yatırım A.Ş. and included in the Platform of Public Enlightenment, the yellow-red club will pay Osmanlıspor 7 million 500 thousand euros for the bonus fee of the player, 750 thousand if he plays a total of 25 matches in the league, cup and Europe, and 750 thousand if he plays 50 more matches.
Galatasaray will pay a total of 11 million euros in guarantee fees to Ndiaye, who has signed a four-year contract, including 2 million 750 thousand euros for each year.
Ndiaye will also receive a bonus of €5,000 for every point the yellow-red team gets in matches in the TFF Super League and UEFA competitions.
The statement also announced that the player has the right to unilaterally terminate the contract as of 15 June 2019 in exchange for 18 million euros.
The last day of the rush!
They're rushing to the fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged in Istanbul last Thursday, along with the storm and hail.
While most of the drivers who received reports from the fire department to be covered by insurance companies, the drivers who did not receive reports until today also queued for reports.
Today, the drivers who did not have a helmet and did not report, because this is the last day of the notification period, came to the fire stations and requested a report.
Today is the last day.
The drivers first asked the firefighters to take pictures of their vehicles to determine the damage.
The drivers whose vehicles were found damaged later reported to the officers.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, "I've recorded it, I'll take a picture".
It was a busy place when I got there.
"There was damage to the windshield", he said.
Driver Erbil Sword, "We came to race to race".
We're in line.
We had the photo taken.
He said, "Now we're waiting for the report".
The skyscrapers that are sea and land walls don't breathe
CHP MP Nadir Ataman warned of the earthquake in relation to the giant structures that are rising on the coast, saying: "The expert report in the case clearly says that these structures will not withstand the 6 magnitude earthquake".
The stakes, which are 25 to 30 meters beneath the solid rock, are not said to be dug this deep.
Istanbul Ataköy beach, high-rise hotels and residences that form a wall between sea and land left the district breathless.
CHP Bakırköy Municipal Council Member Nadir Ataman reacted to the huge AVM, hotel and residence projects that are rising in the district one after another.
Ataman pointed out that the wind cut off the buildings on the beach, "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind created Atatürk Forest in Floria.
80 years later, they've reached the point where they've gotten a sense of urbanism, where they've built giant skyscrapers in the wind tunnels and changed the climate.
"He's not breathing on the pill", she said.
Ataman said that the buildings that rise like walls on the Ataköy coast change the climate balance: "The temperature is 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers".
These buildings need to be built with the winds in their direction.
But our skyscrapers are rising above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind can't get in the district.
These structures are upsetting the natural balance of life.
Ataman said that the skyscrapers, which harm the environment and human health, cut the connection of Bakırköy residents with the sea, and said that they will appeal to the Monuments Board and go to court.
Hair loss can be treated without surgery.
The phenol has been shown to be 83% effective.
In this method, diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with a hair-killer.
Another treatment technique for non-surgical hair loss is laser therapy.
The hair follicles and surrounding tissue are burned with various lasers by circular beams, which cause the tissue to stick together.
These two non-surgical treatments of hair loss allow patients to return to their social and work lives in less time.
Dr. Mert Atak said that excessive weight, sedentary lifestyle, sitting for a long time, thick hair and body hair and not following hygiene rules cause hair loss.
Italy is tightening its approach to NGO rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with new rules affecting their operations.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa, "If NGOs do not comply with the new statute, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate".
Minniti's warning comes a day after Italian authorities seized a boat operated by the German aid organization Jugend Rettet, suspecting its crew of effectively collaborating with human smugglers to facilitate illegal migration.
The charity, which has been active for just one year, declined to comment on the content of detailed charges brought against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
The organization said in a statement on social media: "Saving human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot work in the search and rescue area at this time".
"We can only evaluate the allegations that are being made now after we have gathered all the information and we can assess the situation".
Italian authorities had been tracking the boat of Jugend Rettet, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that the crew took the migrant aboard a boat full of rubber boots delivered directly to them by human traffickers and allowed the traffickers to escape in the boats for re-use.
According to prosecutor's files, at least one such encounter allegedly took place 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is accused of defying the authority of Italian coastguard who oversee rescue operations in the area for more than humanitarian efforts.
The regulations required that on the deck of boats like the Iuventa there be an Italian police officer who would clearly supervise their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the charter: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Tuesday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not cause any "serious change or impediment" to his rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescues in recent weeks was an indication that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal security and cooperation with local governors were bearing fruit.
"We've started to see the light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
This month, he announced plans to hold more talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries with the hope of reaching Europe, including Chad, Niger and Mali.
It's a last minute punch!
Watermelon-dried vodka was drunk as every year at the "Day of the Paratroopers" celebrations in Moscow, the capital of Russia.
He attacked Nikita Razvozjayev, a Russian television reporter who was broadcasting live from a Russian Gorky Park where he was drinking too much alcohol.
The reporter, who was reporting the day's events live, warned the man who suddenly appeared and yelled "We will take over Ukraine".
The drunk man, identified as a former paratrooper, punched her hard on the reporter's warning.
The reporter, startled by the punch he received, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shock live.
The Coordination Council of the Economy has met
The Economic Coordination Council (EKK) was chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy, Mehmet Şimşek.
The first meeting of the ECC under the chairmanship of Shymshek after the cabinet change began at 18.30 in Çankaya Köşkü.
The meeting will discuss the macroeconomic outlook of Turkey.
The meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Labor and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Treasury Deputy Osman Çelik, President of the Central Bank Murat Çetinkaya and relevant bureaucrats.
You can get rid of a hip fracture in 45 minutes.
Doç. Dr. Oğuz Karaeminoğlu, who pointed out that only 5 percent of patients need surgery for a hip discharge, says, "According to the results of the examination and imaging of the patient, the first step is rest and drug treatment".
He said that the patient group should be tested with the most effective methods (e.g. epidural injection, radio frequency techniques, intra-disc procedures) and warned that if the procedure is not successful, and the patient has a weakness and drowsiness in the legs, then surgery is necessary.
Karaeminoğlu said that the 'full-closed hip fracture surgery' that reduces the risk of the disease, which can reduce the risk of the disease, also allows patients who cannot be treated with innovative methods to reduce their hesitation about the operation.
Although microscopic surgery is relatively successful compared with open surgery, there may be some complications after surgery, such as a long recovery period, adhesions to the spine, recurrence of a hernia, and possible later back dislocation and infection.
Often microscopic surgery is described as 'closed surgery', but microscopic surgery is also practiced in the same approach as open surgery.
In a fully closed hip fracture, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissue is preserved.
The full-close hip-lock surgery only takes 45 minutes.
Special commission is in session.
The commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökdağ, Jemal Okan Yüksel, Barış Yarkadaş and Turan Aydoğan, a member of the High Discipline Board.
The Commission has published the results of the Berberoğlu report on October 4 in Istanbul 14.
He will be followed by his trial in the Court of Heavy Penalties and the appeals to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeal.
In the assignment letter signed by CHP General Secretary Kamil Okyay Sindir and General Vice President Bülent Tezcan, "The independence and impartiality of the judiciary, the fact that it does not receive orders from anywhere other than the law is an indispensable condition of justice".
"Our MP Mr. Enis Berberoğlu did not demand any special status while performing his duties as a MP, did not take refuge in the armor of immunity that his MP recognizes, wanted to protect his faith in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary".
The trial process has been suggested that the court prefers to apply political orders rather than judging.
The article argued that the fact that the arrest warrant was issued before the verdict was determined despite the Constitutional Court's decisions finding the MPs' arrests wrong is a clear proof that the court made the decision under influence.
Michelle Carter was convicted of promoting Conrad Roy's suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years of eligible parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the taxidermy murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father spoke at the trial on Thursday, saying, "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend".
Carter has been released pending an appeal.
Although she faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, her legal team had argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, was tearful, his hands clasped, and his eyes staring down at the ground as he was being punished.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy".
He ended her life to heal his own.
He didn't take responsibility".
"He showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible situation that he regretted completely".
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said that he did not see "any significant influence on his actions by age, maturity, or even mental illness".
A prosecutor read a statement from Lynn Roy, Mr. Roy's mother: "There is not a day that goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I'm coping, and I'm trying to be there for her sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever".
Mr. Roy's sister Camdyn Roy has stated that she "has never lost sight" of the fact that her brother will never be able to attend his wedding or that he will never be able to continue to care for his children.
"That person you've been with every day since I was born is no longer a pain that will always be with me for the rest of my life".
Since there is no Massachusetts law that criminalizes telling someone to kill themselves, it looks like the case will settle.
Mr. Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning when Carter was 17.
The case drew national attention when it emerged that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While he was on vacation with his family, she had sent him a series of messages two weeks before his death, saying, "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of ways".
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You must do this, Conrad", and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy".
Judge Moniz ordered the press not to be allowed to profit from this case, saying Carter wanted to draw attention to himself through Mr. Roy's death.
The case has divided legal opinions.
Among the minority defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30, published a dissenting opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, saying: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison".
The stunning growth forecast from Mehmet Şimşek
Smashek said in his statement that inflation in Turkey should be reduced to low single-digit figures and that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his speech, Lightning said:
The next 12 months are critical in reducing uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
There's a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope the uncertainties in our immediate geography will also be reduced.
I believe that by reforming our resilience to shocks, we can put Turkey on a growth trend above 5%.
I told you months ago.
The worst part is that he's behind.
Slowly, we're shifting our energy away from those areas and toward inclusive growth, reforms that will create jobs...
So the next 12 months are critical.
Reform on the one hand, and on the other hand, there is less political uncertainty.
Hopefully, with luck, the problems in our nearby geography will be less.
Like it or not, many of our classic markets are collapsing.
It's like Libya, Iraq.
We're not just losing Sunday, we're facing a wave of over 3.5 million.
If you look at the last 15 years, Turkey grew 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, I mean, we have fundamentally solid problems.
Now, with some reforms, we can increase our resilience to shocks and remove some of the question marks in investors' heads, and put Turkey back on a growth policy above 5%.
Let me be clear, we have such a generous pension system here.
I guess it's fair to say our pension companies aren't doing enough.
For once, auto attendance will be a strong performance.
Why? Why?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don't have to go out and make the effort and the expense.
We've been looking at these concerns, and given the poor performance, we've been working on how to allocate global assets to which investment areas.
You know, the returns are high.
For once, there will be a performance there, in addition to the 25% the government provides.
And then the rest of it goes into Treasury bills, which are generally low risk.
I think you'll be interested in the next period when we look at the big picture.
Because they're gonna see the performance.
In the other field, there is not failure, but success.
We rebuilt the BES in 2013.
There are 6.8 million participants, 70 billion lire in savings.
Give it up, the system worked.
There are 2.6 million participants in the automatic subscription, and I have 775 million lire saved.
We're asking the companies to do a little more.
Get some publicity, explain the system.
We're working on the cage.
Maybe if we stretch him a little bit...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens see the return, see the savings, and it stays in the system.
38 percent of them are out of the system.
Almost half of those who leave are on voluntary individual retirement.
You don't want two separate retirement accounts.
What are you doing? !
You're out of the car.
We were expecting a drop of about 10 percent.
And that means we're very optimistic.
Once the system works.
We brought a premium ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes explain it one-sidedly.
They raised their premiums too fast.
When we asked what was going on, they said the court orders didn't take into account the existing regulations.
We've made a clear new arrangement.
We told you to do your part.
They said, "No, we wait for the verdict".
And we said, "That's not gonna happen".
We have a difference of opinion here.
Of course, when this ceiling premium went into effect, some companies refused.
We made a new arrangement.
We've created a pool of risky policyholders.
I'll say it again.
I prefer to operate this system through competition.
I mean, I don't think this ceiling pricing thing is right, they just made us.
I'd like to see this in three dimensions.
Consider the system we've created.
Two, the system works normally, a price on that track.
And the additional burdens are heavy, almost 30-31 liras of every 100 liras of premium paid goes to tax deductions.
I'm working on it now, we're going to talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is advancing rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will also decrease significantly structurally.
But it's compulsory traffic insurance.
The headline of the morning saved his leg
Buerger's disease, which appears from adolescence, was once a male disorder, but it is now common among women.
One of these women is 36-year-old Mehtap Dursun.
The pain started two years ago and became chronic in the sole of his foot.
The young woman, who had difficulty walking, was in danger of losing her leg and was taken to hospital.
A friend of his recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The headline in SABAH showed the news "Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Emergency Situations".
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to the emergency room.
Dursun, who soon recovered from his pain, is now receiving oxygen therapy.
Audi to modify 850,000 diesel cars in the face of backlash from automakers
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman of the board of directors said that the company believes there are "more smart options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's headquarters (where diesel vehicles are being considered for a ban or restriction).
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the firms have identified these moves as recalls.
European carmakers had heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are known to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment that automobile companies must install to neutralize the dirty smoke emitted by diesel vehicles is also rising, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive in price.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has been accused of indulging powerful car companies and ignoring the gravity of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which hides the use of a device known as a decoy and regulates emissions when a car is tested and then loosens them under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Audi's engine development department, thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Former principal Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not eligible for extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a German criminal investigation that involved Volkswagen, which had expanded the U.S.-based investigation after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions regulations in Europe.
Audi's involvement in the investigation may be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker has an excessive share of Volkswagen's profits.
Don 't jump to any conclusions .
Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükürü Çağlar, President of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, warned against jumping into shallow areas where the depth is not certain.
Every year, thousands of people face the risk of stroke from neck fractures and spinal cord damage caused by diving into shallow water.
Neck fractures most often develop in the 5th or 6th vertebra.
The thing about fractures at this level is that it affects the nerves that feed the muscles of the arms and legs as well as the respiratory muscles.
"The neck spinal region, our most valuable organ in these types of accidents, is cut or compressed by the broken vertebrae and becomes nonfunctional", says Prof. Dr. Çağlar.
"Wrong first aid for spinal cord injuries not only increases the damage to the injured but can also lead to death", he said.
Diving is the fourth leading cause of spinal cord injuries.
The average age of the victims is 20 to 29 years old, and most of them are male.
Prof. Dr. Chaglar, "You shouldn't jump into the water where you can't see".
"No matter how well you dive, you can get seriously injured", he said.
Prof. Dr. Chaglar also recalled:
Depending on the level of spinal damage at the site of the injury, paralysis of the arms and legs can occur in varying degrees.
You may know how to swim, but water can be deceiving.
What seems deep to you may be shallow.
In the United States and Australia, warning signs have reduced the number of shallow-water fishing jumps by 70 percent.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, "Although Turkey has 28 beaches, unfortunately, there are not a single warning sign outside Istanbul".
"In relation to these types of life-threatening accidents, every year before summer, the health department, schools and social awareness projects should have information lights or information boards on beaches and pools in a noticeable way".
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, Chairman of the Spinal and Peripheral Neurosurgery Group of the TURKEY Neurosurgery Association, suggested that in case of injury:
The first thing to do is call 911.
The neck should be kept as steady as possible, not moved, fixed with a stiff collar.
The airway should be provided and the patient should lie on his or her back to drain the water that has escaped to the lungs.
He shouldn't be held by the legs and hung up to drain the water.
The deformity in the patient's neck should not be corrected.
He may have broken his neck vertebrae.
However, if the spinal cord is not yet damaged, improper neck position during first aid and patient transportation can cause broken bone fragments to press on the spinal cord and cut and damage it.
Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
It's become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but it also has a warning that it's under threat from climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, and this is causing a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM, a Provence-based agricultural research institute, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings much less rain in spring and mostly in autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small leaf beetle, the Augustan, which is a microbe-carrying pest, and it is abundant in very dry air".
And a lot is at stake.
As much as it attracts holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for its perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "We should have a few large flowers with very tall stems, but we have smaller, less developed or none at all or weak stems.
So we have less essential oils".
Solutions reviewed include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying a protective clay and water mixture on plants and developing more drought-resistant species.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to review the latest unrest unleashed by organized crime in Sinaloa state, corrupt officials and plans to cover the never-ending drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to discuss their safety.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office that was targeted by a hand grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column, no proof needed, perceptions and internal voices are enough.
A list of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being paid by the government or cartels, a list of villains who make it dangerous to write about the chaos of Mexico in the newspaper.
There is no denying the violence, and while the number of dead bodies is rising across the country, more are being killed by journalists: According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 people have died since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven have died in seven states so far this year.
Among the latest deaths is Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce, a creative director and inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotic violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, with a large photo of Valdez's middle finger with the words "Justice" hanging on the front of Riodoce's building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that show his smile, his face with glasses and his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters talk about their shared trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, their paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was created in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, the Committee to Protect Journalists has prosecuted only two.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on referring to the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken, even though the ground is now more deceptive.
Without information about the killers, without justice, security consultations are of little use, says Ibarra.
"It's stupid to waste my time in this studio".
"Until we know why, you don't trust anyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state capital.
His red Toyota Corolla was only able to drive a few blocks before being stopped by two men, forced out of the vehicle and shot 12 times, roughly translated as the name of his newspaper, the Twelfth River.
The gunman got into his car and drove away, and he hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He's got a wife and two grown children.
In Culiacan, gossip tends to run free.
But there's almost nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival groups fight to fill the void.
Let alone the fact that one or more people are shot and killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or the fact that the graveyard is filled with the mausoleums of drug lords, or two-story, fancy houses bigger than many houses to live in.
Forget for a minute about the "quiet" situation where only one cartel controls valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and manager of Riodoce, was devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the murder.
First, a February broadcast featured an interview with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups at war with Guzman's sons.
This may have angered the sons; the likely gang members bought every copy of the printed edition as soon as it was distributed to the newspaper dealers.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper with the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican-origin violence against journalists.
He'd survived so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013 when he participated in the discovery of Riodoce by selling $50 shares to five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to be a journalist without touching on the topic of drugs", Bojorquez said.
In time, the paper gained a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish life-affirming investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were drawn to a publication where they could read stories no one else dared to report.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its journalism in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous stand against the Mexican drug story no matter where it ended.
He admitted he was scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to keep living".
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life".
"You must accept your duty as a journalist, to play this or that fool.
I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?'"
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the joker who swears like a porter, his friends who embrace and give generous advice, his teachers who know how to survive...
They trusted his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to a bar called El Guayabo across the street from the office and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Has his love of routine collapsed?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and survive.
"If you mess with their wives and children, their clean jobs, the secret airstrips they use to move drugs, they don't like it".
Bojorquez said, "These things were over the line".
The result was a high degree of autosensitivity and self-preservation, even at the best of times.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you smell bad, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, Riodoce's editorial director, said that "smell is a deceptive sensation... and that's what happened to Javier".
He and others say the old rules don't apply in Sinaloa, just as they don't apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials...
The ground is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training, and just days ago, it was revealed that spyware sold only to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers tried to escape the 104 degree heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-serious, half-serious, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police the governor himself said he couldn't be trusted.
Reporters have been in the mountainous countryside for months, where drug gangs are effectively in control.
In this week's issue, Riodoce explores three main stories.
The brother of former heavyweight boxer Julio Cesar Chavez was murdered in Sinaloa.
Also, there was a disclosure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And then there was a kidnapping of a gang at the most expensive restaurant in Culiacan, one block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write what everyone in the city knew, caution prevailed: the restaurant was a favorite of both drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated almost every level of politics for the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational incidents.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about earlier events at the scene, including the escape of one of "El Chapo" Guzman's sons during a military raid.
Only months ago, readers would have looked in Valdez's corner for the best source on the kidnapping.
Villareal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build, said: "We already knew what was going on before".
"All communication with our sources is now cut off".
While the staff transforms into something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez's office is being reused as a warehouse for banners and posters protesting the killing of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed some banners and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning to protest for another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and DNA tests confirm that it's him.
Journalists across the country have been voicing their thoughts more loudly by writing "Help Boss" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
After that day, he asked to be assigned to a job other than government news, thinking his anger was hurting his neutrality.
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, accomplices, officials and a careless society.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism", he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces collaborating with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 has linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, "You die in Mexico because they want to silence you".
The murders were clearly cold shower effects.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
His body was found with a note said to be signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news".
A computer keyboard and headset, strapped to the side of his severed head.
Some publications, such as El Norte, opted to close down after the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March in the northern border state of Chihuahua.
After the murder of their manager in 2004, others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with the headline on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their own states, even the country.
It's a decision you make.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still patroling the streets, waiting for danger.
Sometimes, they are captured, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was murdered in a Mexico City apartment in 2015 with four other women three months after fleeing Veracruz.
It's a dance with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and keep working.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter".
On a recent Saturday night, midnight, while the final issue was being prepared for completion, the Riodoce editorial directors sat outside their office on the sidewalk drinking beer, and their phones rang at the same time.
A series of gun battles involving rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort of Mazatlan have left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised in a series of cartel messages.
They posted the news on Riodoce's website via cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
Sirens are going off nearby, there's another gun battle in the area.
Bojorquez quickly glanced at the police officers on duty to see if they were alert.
Even if they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Under the gigantic portrait of his newspaper's defeated founders, his middle finger was exposed for all of Sinaloa to see, Riodoce's staff following in his footsteps.
"How can you think of shutting down", said Bojorquez, "when the intern asked me to send him out to report on the street the day Javier was killed?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a terrible one.
Researchers now say the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner are so well preserved that experts have identified it as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that they could tell that the seal skin was reddish brown and had a 'troubled history.'
A report in Current Biology described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived from the mid-Cretaceous period, 110 million to 112 million years ago.
Its remarkable well-preservation has astounded researchers, who describe it as "truly magnificent".
The herbivorous armor is the best preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports in National Geographic.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, while digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that looked strange from the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years digging up the wild animal from a 2,500-pound pile of dirt.
After so much intense work, the finished product is now ready to be unveiled.
Caleb Brown, lead author of the study and a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display, said: 'If you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe it's asleep.'
'It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'
Researchers have examined its skin and found that although it was covered in armor and resembled a walking tank, this herbivore probably faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and a protective technique known as counter-shading, which many modern animals use.
Experts suggest that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to blend in better with its surroundings and outrun its enemies.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodozor family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers have now completed their work and named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly trying to uncover it.
The species' remarkable conservation has allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the seals and the body armor.
They discovered countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means the upper part of the creature is darker from below.
Although countershading is common, the findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds the countershading animals alive today.
This means that the dinosaur was sufficiently oppressed and hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that it preferred to face evolution as a means of survival.
But the most modern animals that use counter-shading (e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos) are much smaller and much more prone to becoming prey, meaning this nodosaur has had a serious challenge to survive.
"So the powerful hunting of a heavily armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in the Cretaceous could be", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the seals also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues to its life, including preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean surface.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and probably rivers and oceans spread farther inland than they do now.
"Nodozor is really remarkable in that it is completely covered and protected with a striated skin, but also the original form of the animal is preserved in 3D", Brown said.
'The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need much imagination to reconstruct it; if you close your eyes a little, you might even believe it's almost asleep.'
The Cretaceous was when giant theropods, two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs, roamed the Earth.
Although he was king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by a group of formidable ancestors.
Among these is Acrocanthosaurus, a monster that was 38 ft (11.5 m) long and weighed 6 tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed out to sea after its death and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, while digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it's the best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and it's intact from nose to ass.
The creature averages around 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
It has two 20-inch-long horns protruding from its shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored grasshopper roamed roughly in what is now western Canada until it was swept out to sea by a flowing river.
But the dinosaur's undersea tomb preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossil remains of this particular species are so well preserved that fragments of skin still cover the bulbous armor layers along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such conservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more amazing it becomes.
Fossil fragments of skin still cover the pointed, bulbous armor layers of the dinosaur's skull.
Right front leg is lying on its side, five fingers tilted upwards.
I can count the marks on your foot".
Don't be so hard on yourself about whitening.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every man's dream.
While people are resorting to various ways to whiten their teeth, Nükhet Berk, president of the Oral Laser Applications Association, warns that products sold in stores or on the internet should be avoided.
"Tooth whitening can be achieved with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of the teeth like a nail", says Nükhet Berk, who says that such products scratch the surface of the enamel and stain the teeth so that they can never be recycled again.
Noting that maintaining dental health prevents the development of many diseases, and that aesthetic practices are important for mental health, as they provide both dental and gum health and a beautiful smile, Berk shares:
Unless there is a disorder in the structure of the teeth or genetic factors, young people usually have white teeth.
Due to aging, tooth decay, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, abrasives, or dark-colored beverages, teeth become darker over the years.
Tooth whitening can be achieved with chemicals applied by dentists or with fine, sticky porcelain surfaces applied with minimal or no erosion to the surface of the teeth.
Never whiten teeth with products sold in stores or online.
Because these substances stain the surface of the enamel, staining the teeth so they can never be recycled.
Keçiören Municipality has been providing "Home Dental Health Services" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens since 2011.
65-year-old Köksal Güngör, who has been confined to bed for 24 years in Keçiören's Awakenings Mahallesi, said, "My wife was aware of this service of Keçiören Municipality".
We called the city, they came right away.
"Already paralyzed from the neck down, this service helps me to maintain my dental care".
Kezban Gökçe, 72, daughter of 95-year-old Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, who lives in Pınarbaşı neighborhood, said, "My mother has been bedridden for seven and a half years because of her old age".
When I got to the city hall, I saw the billboards for this service, and I called right away.
We've been taking this service regularly for four years.
I have a problem with my teeth, so when the doctors come, they look at me.
He used the words "very pleased".
There is no health insurance requirement for the service, which is completely free.
The "old" incident in the Turkish army
Dear readers, the Supreme Military Council (SMC) meeting the other day made some very interesting decisions, especially for the Navy.
This force is not commanded by an Admiral, but by a Rear Admiral.
It's almost unheard of in our military.
So how did that happen?
The Commander of the force, Admiral Bülent Bostanoğlu, has completed his term, he was already going to retire...
And it did.
Now the command came to the only vice admiral, Veysel Kösele.
Veysel Pasha, who was a victim of the kumpas in the past and was detained for a while, should have been a commander in the normal rank.
But the government didn't want it.
I'm trying to make it very clear, starting at the top of the Marine Corps, Commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
In that case, he's the only remaining midshipman in the Navy.
The vacant position was supposed to be filled by him, Navy Commander number two, Admiral Veysel Kösele.
And then what happened?
Admiral Adnan Özbal, ranked sixth, was appointed by the government.
Now look at this painting!
Admiral Veysel Kösele is standing there, but a lower-ranking commander is being appointed in his place!
He's being put in charge of a senior, a junior.
I wonder what happens next?
A vice admiral above rank does not and cannot serve under a lieutenant general below him.
He doesn't take orders from her.
In that case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this painful situation, if he is not retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
And that's the offensive message from the government: "Goodbye Veysel Pasha!"
The news of his resignation was out yesterday afternoon when I wrote this, but it had not yet been officially announced.
Now let's go over this again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, didn't want to, forced him to resign and replaced him with a sixth-ranking bodyguard, damaging the traditional understanding of our army as "Kıdem".
There's gotta be politics involved, and we don't know behind the scenes.
Maybe soon someone will tell us, and we'll all find out together!
Dear readers, I tried to explain very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the issue of seniority is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, an officer who graduates tenth in the military academy is senior to one who graduates eleventh.
The first-ranking general is senior to the second-ranking general.
We had concrete examples of this in the War of Independence.
The commander of the Garp Front, Ismet Pasha...
You have two armies at your command.
Army and the 2nd Army.
We're in 1922, and our armies are about to launch a major offensive to drive out the Greek army.
There are valuable names waiting to be appointed to the army command at this stage.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered the command of the army, but he says, "Ismid is inferior to me, I cannot take his orders".
Another name is Yakup Şevki (Subaşi) Pasha.
Atatürk's teacher at the military academy...
A valued and senior commander who fought in various wars, whom he loved and respected, whom he called "Master".
In 1919, he was captured along with soldiers and civilian Turkish intellectuals and deported to the island of Malta by the British.
When he returned home, he was reluctant to take command of the army and said the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is not senior to me, I cannot take orders from him".
But Ataturk persuades him to accept the request and Yakup Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third one is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha, who is also a former police officer.
A soldier who talks too much, who criticizes all the time.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He's being deported to Malta by the British, escapes there and comes to Ankara via the Balkans.
When he was offered the command of the army, Ali Ihsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight under Ismet, who is less senior than me"...
But he's being persuaded...
But you see, after starting his mission, he constantly argues with Ismet Pasha, the commander of the Garp Front, whom he commands, causing disturbances and disturbing the army...
And shortly before the big raid, he's being discharged and retired, replaced by Nurettin Pasha with a beard.
After that, Ali Ihsan Pasha's relationship with Ataturk never improved.
The issue of seniority in the Turkish army is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he has to.
And Köyselsele is the latest example.
How did an activist find himself having to answer the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after arriving in New York City for a vacation, the St. Louis native sat in the bed of an Airbnb he rented and started surfing Facebook on his phone.
It matched a high school exchange.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying in the street".
He was surprised to find that no one else was sharing this information in his content stream, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah takma was constantly being retweeted in his content stream.
The St. Louis rapper was tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body, which he's staying with for four hours, in the street.
Ferrell thought to himself, "This is brutal".
But death was not new to him or to his people.
He left his phone later that evening to turn to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were police tapes, people screaming, and pictures of a man claiming to be Brown's father, holding a sign that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop, he says, pulled the trigger on his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals".
Ferrell remembered saying, "This is unusual".
"'This is not a murder of our usual kind, nor a typical one.'
I felt a chill.
I was angry and I was crying".
She booked a round-trip ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he picked up his 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to drive with her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?"
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance from the perspective of the people who live in that society and fill the streets with the answers they're looking for.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with his daughter, wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, they returned to the conversation they had repeatedly had earlier that morning about "the experiences of blacks and the condition of blacks".
"Remember I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe in?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old kid, and it wasn't true.
I couldn't help it". Ferrell said later.
"What is happening here today... is a result of what has happened in the past.
He has to know, see and grow up with it.
Not only should he be well-rounded in activism and organizing, but he should know the layers of the black experience and the black condition and the liberation, what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience the raw racism, she'll be no different than any black woman or child.
I feel like I'm hurting her by protecting her from this".
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was South Florissant Road, which became a kind of campground for activists, across from the police station, where they waited for a speech on the issue that later resulted in Officer Darren Wilson not being charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter connected with local business owners who made packaged foods.
They prepared bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new kind of activism was slowly forming.
She stated that she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Association while a student at Missouri State University and focused on food justice and health inequities in the black community.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It just came".
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, at an evening screening.
Folayan said he and his own director of photography, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, "wanted to document" what was happening.
Ferrell had a question: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was expressed by countless people, often white, who came to a community to profit from its suffering and resistance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson couldn't concentrate their voices, and we decided to do it differently".
Folayan had already contacted Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement warmed Ferrell to the project, which the "Streets of Whose?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting, along with six other area natives.
David said: "This documentary is not about someone speaking for us or talking to us; we are the ones speaking".
"That was the key for me, how these people were going to be represented because that's how I was going to be represented".
Folayan said that while the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, he proved to be the most open of the film participants, speaking in a manner that showed the movement was "not about a messianic leader, it's about bringing the community together".
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documents the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as his falling in love and marrying his wife.
Ferrell, laughing at the first sight of the finished product, said, "I felt naked".
"But I realized that in doing this work and humanizing black people, there can be a certain amount of sensitivity".
Also, Ferrell's story reinforces and refocuses the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who created the #BlackLivesMatter slogan on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify as gay.
"Black lesbian women in leadership have generally kept the movement going", Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to bear the brunt of it".
Folayan agreed, noting: "The movement is really being sustained by black women and many gay black women".
Yet Ferrell insists that this is "when there is nothing in the affirmative action range" and he is not selected because of his identities.
"He was the one who set this energy in motion", she says.
"But it's no coincidence that she's on the front lines, because as a black gay woman, you have a lot to lose by living a life at these intersections.
You can feel the energy on the screen".
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras are long gone, but there are still disturbing racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell's on another two and a half years for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home as one word: "chaos".
Still, Ferguson carries the song he carved into his memory exactly three years before he took to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our job to win.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round, it's flat!
Speaking to NBC Sports, Irving said, "The earth is not round".
The world is flat.
They get people used to this by making them afraid.
Oh, man, that's a lot of questions.
Because the more information you decode, the more information you get.
This is crazy.
Is the world flat?
Or does it spin round and round?
I think you should look into it.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They're lying to us!
Irving says, "For years I believed what I wanted to believe".
I thought the world was round and spinning.
Do you really think we're going around the solar system?
Nothing they send back.
He's not coming back!
The information they're giving us is highly inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for that truth.
He was like, "Do you know what I'm saying?"
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is flat, is struggling with his 24.4 points and 5.9 assists this season for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
A fitting analogy: the artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Friedman Gallery, there are many faces, white, black and brown, hanging over the cables in the ceiling, each with an almost indistinct resemblance to the other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from earplugs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning, a former intelligence analyst who is serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic messages through the WikiLeaks website, has reportedly sent his hair cut from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opens August 2, is called A Proper Similarity.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her discipline with expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a trans woman pardoned by Barack Obama three days before her term ends, and a prominent dissident.
By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using what a person with this gene data might look like to create 30 portraits, Dewey-Hagborg revealed not only the tractability of DNA data (that there are many ways to mark it and the determinism inherent in interpretation) but also its identity through a strict, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but openly identified as a woman as a teenager, was convicted of 20 felonies in 2013, including six under the Espionage Act, computer forgery and theft.
His image was suppressed by the prison, so that he had only one photograph: a sandy, black and white selfie of Manning, visibly agitated, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum yellow wig that was a nod to himself.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was enjoying a huge success with the release of his 2012 project, More Weird Sensations.
In this case, the artist created portraits by filtering DNA from forensic debris, such as cigarette butts and gum, to create a picture of what these people might look like.
Just then, he got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait that could accompany this writing", Dewey-Hagborg explained at the press release for the new exhibition.
And at the time, there was no way to visit, no way to take a picture, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she was interested in getting a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected correspondents, exchanging many letters over a period of two years.
They even unveiled Repressed Dreams, a cartoon book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, in which the president imagines a future in which Chelsea is pardoned and she can see the exhibition in person.
Obama's request for Manning's release a few days after the book was actually released was a happy coincidence that came after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump is finding new, tweetable ways to fight government leakers and transgender soldiers and further fuel the sharp divisions he's asked to fix, there's something profound and powerful about this exhibit that's opening now.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Things happen for a reason".
An artist's statement written on the gallery wall, under which Manning's signature is in large sizes (the dot of the "i" in her surname is inserted with a heart), called for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on "gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the wall opposite is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C's, G's and A's written in pencil...
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides in the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to show how amazingly similar we are all, at least as biological creatures.
"What I hope people will take away from this is that they don't care about who we are in our genome and how open to interpretation the genetic data is, how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Imitation Memories, is on display.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and this is 30 of them".
The last piece in the exhibit, which is in one room, is a page from the aforementioned short comic book.
Here Manning is shown leaving the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a King Kong-style speaker.
"They win when they shut you up".
"So never shut up".
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote me".
"My hair still tingles when I talk about it".
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibit (as he has quite presciently dreamed from the comic book), but when he does, he will be greeted by masks with his own genetic imitations, gathered in the middle of the room like a group of protesters.
Like everything in the exhibit, the genetic haplogroups were written down in pencil to Manning's height, which was specially made.
Dewey-Hagborg said of portraits, "In the past I would put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd".
"I wanted it to be seen as a collective movement, shaped by Chelsea, which was also the movement behind her liberation".
Northwestern education officer and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University education officer and Oxford University employee who were wanted on suspicion of murder after a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment building in Chicago.
Cook County records show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for first-degree murder without bail, for their alleged role in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers got a call, they reached the Grand Plaza Apartments, and they found the victim with multiple deep cuts on his body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and that detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide as police actively search for the two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an emailed statement, Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said Lathem was placed on administrative leave and banned from Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that is under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville University said in an emailed statement: "We are in contact with UK police and are ready to assist US investigating authorities in any way they may need".
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encouraged the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to locate them are intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Google said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Google has just received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who has just received a mysterious tip that something is happening in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very gruesome.
Google said it was unclear if the incident happened on July 27.
He said that Lathem and Warren were in the building, confirmed by security cameras.
"We believe the victim was in a relationship with faculty member Latham", said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza administration issued a statement to residents saying: "Police are still working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a number of incidents, including a possible family incident".
Italy has seized the German ship
Italian police say a boat carrying out search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean has been seized on Lampedusa.
The police also shared with journalists the recordings of the phone conversations that they claim belonged to two members of the organization, and announced that this operation was carried out within the scope of the investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
The members of Jugend Rettet, who are alleged to have "activated in favour of illegal migration on the Libya-Italy line", are alleged to have brought refugees to Italy at least three times, directly from the ships of Libyan human traffickers.
The charges against the members of Jugend Rettet, who are being questioned by the prosecution, include working with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
The organization said in a statement that it was considering the charges against it, saying that saving lives would remain its priority.
In addition to the Italian Coast Guard and European Union (EU) vessels, some nine international civil society organisations are involved in the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government had drafted a 13-point code of conduct for these organizations to follow and made it a condition for their signature.
Last minute: 5 buffets of Banli who attacked Büyükerşen sealed
The five buffets of the retired police officer Mahfuz Banli, who was arrested by the court after the incident of the attack on the Mayor of Eskişehir Yilmaz Büyükerşen, were sealed by the Tepebaşı Municipality.
According to Haberturk, the municipal teams were accompanied by a large number of police and the Flexible Force team.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA roadmap in the short term"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria to become operational again.
"The roadmap has been completed at a certain stage in the fulfilment of the criteria, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was reviewing the second part of the WADA Regulatory Compliance Roadmap, which was recently published on the agency's website, which describes the criteria governing the re-activation of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this doesn't contain anything to worry Russia about.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future".
However, one criterion mentioned in the list means that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the reported results of an alleged state-sponsored doping investigation into Russian sport by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which was approved by WADA.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "While our anti-doping system admits a failure, we are also conducting an investigation.
All precautions have been taken.
But there is no government program and we will not accept something that does not exist".
Mutko's comments echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged past problems with Russian anti-doping authorities but added: "We have said on many occasions that the report contains conflicting positions and regulations.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally", Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia in the wake of the November 2005 doping scandal.
However, the planning and coordination of the test was authorised this June under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In July, after a visit to the agency's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to become operational again.

Galatasaray President will not go back empty handed
Former Galatasaray president Faruk Süren has harshly criticized President Dursun Özbek, who went to Bucharest to convince Mircea Lucescu and to Ankara to transfer Ndiaye.
Here are the legendary president's private statements to the readers of SABAH:
Lucescu-Uzbek conversation: "We were finishing when we left".
The Galatasaray president does not go away empty handed.
The transfer of Ndiaye: Galatasaray President does not go to the footballer.
The football player comes to the president's feet.
Of course they meet, kiss your hand or hug...
But whoever the player is, the president won't go to his feet.
You give 9 million euros to a player who was bought by Osmanlıspor for 300 thousand euros...
It's not 7.5 million, it's 9 million with bonuses!
You've already made a big investment, of course you'll play, and it'll be 7.5 and 9...
I don't want to criticize.
But the situation is clear.
G. The palace values are eroding.
It's not just football, it's the whole approach.
The only thing that's gonna change that is the Judiciary Committee and the General Assembly.
But I understand the members are happy!
Start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, misleading.
Even though he was committed to anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"There was never any consistency or objectivity", says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person hair care e-commerce company in San Francisco.
He called out for help.
A new kind of HR startup is emerging to help companies understand how their employees feel.
These allow companies to produce and license software that specifically aims to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to conduct agile, selective surveys, target specific teams and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow employees to report a misconduct bypassing senior management and going directly to the board.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City startup that measures employee engagement by software analytics companies, said, "You have tools that track your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where's your company's Fitbit?"
Errett says that using Glint, three years later, his employees have a better understanding of what they're thinking and feeling.
It provides a heat map that provides a look at which parts of the company receive the most complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, as well as providing quick surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, so that you can pinpoint the reasons for these.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to be aware of their workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber, which has been in a scandal since Uber described a harassment environment in which those who openly speak their minds are punished in a blog post by a former employee.
For startups like Glint, this need for supervision means a very lucrative business opportunity.
According to financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity in Denver Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies detect and prevent misconduct, grew amid Uber's defamation controversy earlier this year.
Convercent has about 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to perform personalized pulse surveys, collect real-time hidden responses, and produce heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous helpline where employees can report misconduct.
If the president is indicted, complaints go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Covercent, said, "The public court has taken over the regulators".
Quinlan said that if a company treats its employees badly or unethically, even if regulators don't step in, it could face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee injury or lawsuits.
With more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than a year to help its employees stay informed about policies and procedures and provide easy access to corporate headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or an e-mail address for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's chief legal counsel, James Vitrano, said these were mostly intimidating and uncomfortable experiences, not a good way to follow up on employee complaints.
But now, with the company using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers who lived far from the office, city or state (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices) can be detected and resolved more quickly.
Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group, said: "I can approach this employment experience even more with a holistic, 360-degree perspective".
"We also protect our shareholders from business litigation".
After the collapse of accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 2002 over ethics violations stemming from the Enron scandal, companies took ethics, values and employee relations more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media came into its own", companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going viral.
"Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge recurring fees for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that is endorsed by the venture capitalists who back both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing his total funding to $60 million.
Given the interconnected nature of companies, their cultures and their venture capital, these investments are not surprising.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just the minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, LinkedIn's vice president of global benefits and employee experience, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said, "When people are happy to be at a company, when they feel their voices are heard, and when they feel satisfied with the work they do, they are more willing to make that company successful".
Investors make a profit when their portfolio companies perform well; companies do well when their employees are sincere and feel like they belong.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee sincerity and sense of belonging, it's no surprise that they find support.
Having data on employee loyalty is important to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the people in charge of the company don't act.
In fact, a company that asks for feedback from its employees can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn't come soon enough or doesn't come at all, it can lead to disappointment and make employees feel disconnected.
Russell Raath, who is a consultant at Kotter International, a management consulting firm, and who sees that companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection, said, "If you want 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations".
"Because if you don't follow, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I?'"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day a problem was reported in Glint.
And after gathering feedback from employees who were tired of the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and add communication training to help solve problems.
On Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into its employees, and hopes that in the long run this will translate into being able to retain more workers in this type of industry, which is known to have a high number of employee inputs and outputs.
Vitrona said, "If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people".
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies".
The NCAA cancelling two practices a day is a long day for the Bruins.
It's almost 11 p.m. and a group of UCLA football players are hanging out on the edge of a new practice field on campus.
Some are stripping the top of their uniforms, their backs showing their sweat from the first day of boot camp.
For a significant portion of the team, these free minutes constitute the midday break.
After three hours of practice, players enrolled in summer classes will return to their residence halls and practice their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for the 6:30 a.m. meet-up the next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday's return to Tuesday, "The next three days are a torture for these guys".
The NCAA's decision to eliminate two practice sessions a day, designed to ease the burden on players, actually extended their days, at least until the finals on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three practice sessions are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already tight schedule.
The price of not having two practices a day is more like one practice a day; the Bruins move the start of camp nearly a week ahead of last season, and Mora is training in summer school for the first time in his six seasons at Westwood during summer school.
They plan to practice 18 times through August 20 before they begin their official prep for their September opener against Texas A&M.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change even though the players have added new pens to their intense work schedule.
"We put a huge burden on them for three or four days, and it's very demanding", Mora said.
"And they've just moved on from that; they're working, great guys.
I think we'll have more time when we come on Saturday, it'll be really great".
UCLA will stop training when camp is over, which is no easy task considering the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is raining soccer balls and has a protective net behind the fort, and whose fields lie within sight of the line of sight.
The Bruins players are scheduled to move into the hotel beginning this week, but Mora admits there could be a problem with these rooms being vacated during the season.
Mora said, "We'll have security".
"It's a real concern, and it's not crazy to think that someone would rent a room and sit there and video a workout.
If you have a video of a workout, that's a good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security upstairs in the parking lot at 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan".
Facebook is increasing story verification to fight fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake stories to third-party story verifiers and show their findings below the original post, the world's largest online social network said Thursday in an effort to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that they would use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send them to story verifiers, which would potentially show story verification results below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for what many believe to be fake news that influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
With French voters facing a flood of fake news ahead of the presidential election in May and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts ahead of the September election there, the issue has also become a major political headline in Europe.
In a separate statement on Thursday, Facebook said a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sara Su, Facebook's product manager for newsfeeds, said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are being discussed by third-party story verifiers, people want more sources about what they read and share to make informed decisions".
He added that Facebook would continue to test the "relevant article" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to reduce fake news.
Comic book making: the story of a castle in England
In the recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, inspired by a comic by Jamie Rhodes, a broom-haired Yorkshireman with a passion for historical documentation, Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable chair in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
"I find it very beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years", he says, with a hint of a smile.
"What a personal bond it is to hold this letter in my hand".
A Castle in England, which spans from the Edwardian era to the Middle Ages, documents families living in Scotney, each story being painted by a different artist named from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: she also wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a project she found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"I even got my eye on a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James supporters", he says.
"That was her thumbprint!
And letters always smell like business because back then you would light a fire for light.
For someone 300 years in the future, that smell feels like he's there.
Oh, I love the archives!"
As a lover of old papers, it seems too good to be supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and to be able to stay in a castle for almost four months ("I'm a little overstaying my welcome, to be honest".)
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" Victorian castle, sifting through the archives and studying its many treasures and antiques, such as the heron heads mounted on the walls of the mansion and bottles that had been in the ditches for centuries.
He toured the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle, talking to guards, gardeners, and sometimes artists who worked on his book's illustrations.
Then at night, he would "drink whiskey and write".
The National Trust only gained full access when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006, so the detailed history of Scotney is relatively unknown.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only just begun to handle the archive, which he describes as: "For centuries the aristocrats were saying, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that delineated who owned what: "You'd think land disputes would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a fir tree that two families fought over.
Forget about it, guys!"
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Labourer, which leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, use the castle as a springboard for a broader entry into English history.
"In this book, the Knights of Kent and Sussex, there is a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380", says Rhodes.
"The Peasant Revolt had started around here, and I thought a revolt would be a good place to start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are closely linked to the castle's history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, featuring the 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and embalmed his own body.
The Darrells, Rhodes' favorite Scotney family: "These gentlemen looked like pretty crooks, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved debt crises by marrying wealthy older women, whom I imagine as a bunch of handsome men with the knack of courting female heirs".
Rhodes, who's finished his tour of duty at the fort, is looking for another single-writing experience.
In the Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week job on a comic about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place in his heart.
"I was sad about the breakup", she says.
"It's like, 'Oh, now I have to go and face my fucking real life.'"
The reaction to Meral Akşener is "Maho"
The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) Secretary-General, İsmet Büyükataman, has made a written statement regarding the social media and press claims regarding MHP.
Abu-Katanaman claimed that "there were games and tables to prevent the nationalist movement from continuing to exist under the MHP roof after September 12", using the expression that "some old rifles from Marxist corners" "flow" to the MHP.
The grandfather said:
"Whoever does not digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, whoever does not draw the Turkish's homeland, rubs his hands with the corrupt record, the swollen criminal file, the fuzzy ideology, the confused mind".
"Now they have left" 410 people from the management and members of the MHP Kocaeli Gölcük County Organization and 215 people in the Yenişehir district of MHP Bursa resigned.
The public is being misled by baseless, untrue news like 250 resignations, 300 resignations.
The lies are gigantic in the newspaper columns, the deception deep.
There's no way we're getting that many resignations, and the number of staff in the places in question is not even close.
He called the resignations "so-called" and said that the public was being misled and perception management was being attempted.
"Their propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating a perception against MHP will be counterproductive", said Büyükataman.
MHP's Secretary General Büyükataman said that the MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics.
The old Marxists, who have no sword left, cannot destroy the place of the MHP in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
There's a dirty accounting behind all the comments, the perception management methods used.
Because the media and politics have their eye on the MHP base.
Those who have not done any good work for our party while they are here, resign now, it means nothing to us.
Those who couldn't use our party at their own expense, why did they resign?
The group that has not done anything good for the MHP, shared our memories, understood our countries, joined our struggle, even if they did, they should always stand aside and find other occupations.
The attempts to foment sedition, debate and seeking to split the Nationalist Movement Party, who cannot draw the unity and integrity, are a futile effort.
And it will surely turn and strike its owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish nation, despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, Büyükataman called "political fakes", "political catchers" for those who claimed to be targeting the MHP, "The nationalist movement is not without owner".
"The external odors that feed from across the ocean, from within, will not achieve their purpose, no matter the cost".
"The bandits will go mad and be ashes in the fire of hypocrisy", MHP's Büyükataman said, listing opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, and claiming: "From the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Perinçekgil, from the PKK to FETÖ, no matter who does it, they will not be able to operate on the right of the Turkish nation to own its own destiny".
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of those who planned Turkey without MHP, without MHP; we fought to the end with the bastards who wanted a government without MHP, without MHP.
Now we're gonna ruin the games, make the players miserable.
"Like in the old movie Banker Bilo, which was made by Green Acres, Maho will take the villagers to Germany, after driving them for days in the truck box and leaving them on a mountain slope in Istanbul, it is obvious that the resigners who followed them will leave you on the edge of the cliff saying, 'I am taking you to power.'"
That's their business, but all we ask of these soldiers is that they be new where they're going.
Kjaer has signed for Sevilla.
Kjaer, who has signed for Sevilla for €12.5 million from the yellow-black team, has signed a formal contract that will make him the most expensive defender in the history of the Spanish team.
The Danish star will wear number 4 in Seville.
It's a big relief for parents with babies from THY.
According to a statement from THY Press Consulting, the national airline, which focuses on passenger comfort and satisfaction and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a great travel experience.
In this regard, the "baby travel kit", which was prepared by studying the needs of babies and their families aged 0-2 years, was offered to passengers with babies traveling on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit, which is made with a specially designed bag, contains a change of underwear, a disposable diaper, a cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, a newborn wet cotton swab and a breast pad.
Products that do not contain paraben, alcohol, dyes and harmful chemicals are made with the sensitivity of the baby's skin in mind.
Washington is changing its green card rules.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said there will be a new US immigration plan that changes the rules of the Green Card.
It calls for a reduction in legal immigration to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and endorsed by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the United States grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates who have the financial resources and skills to benefit our economy", Trump was quoted as saying by US media.
The writers commented on the match between Fenerbahce and Sturm Graz
I hadn't seen or seen the glamour I'd seen in two seasons, Lady...
A team of "brokenhearted" who were eliminated by Aykut Kocaman were on the field to make a "stand behind us" deal with the supporter.
You can criticize his play, his positions, his performances, but I haven't seen a game that's so engaging and demanding in a long time.
He showed in the first game, but yesterday he put his shoulders on his shoulder, and now Valbuena is the field commander of Fenerbahce.
His age was a problem when he was transferred, but Big Man had a "persistent character" in his words.
30 years ago, we gave the naming rights of the atomic ant to Reza Chalymbay.
If he does, it'll be the most appropriate comment for the Frenchman.
He was all over the field, he was in all the passing organizations, he was always taking responsibility and scoring, and he put on a huge show for his short stature.
Alper's front-running, second-forward position left the Sturm Graz team "limited" in their field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe was constantly looking for a formula to break through a wall so hard as to close the circuit without a corner.
They're dominating the ball, but they're not producing an effective pass on the opponent's penalty area.
This image may lead to the comment "I need a center", but we're dealing with a player who hesitates to pass to Ahmethan, who can't position his only center.
Either the team didn't trust the young player or his performance needs to improve a little bit.
They missed two clear chances after the score was tied 1-1.
It was important to get through the round, but to get this fan standing up and cheering for the players' fight and say "goal" would make the night even more beautiful.
Probably one or two more transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahçe needs number 12 most...
With this style of play that touches the hearts of those in the stands trying to play in the front, we're on the verge of a very bright and enjoyable season.
Big Man's machine is setting up the spindle, he needs more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will improve.
You can see that the confidence of all the players on the field is increasing.
They really need the applause last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just when you think 2017 can't get any weirder, a new report on technological advances in the sex robot industry comes out.
- I know.
Sex robots are big business right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and one of the founders of the FRR, said we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
Mr Sharkey said of the new report's release: "People are laughing at them, but companies are actually sending a lot and we're going to see more of them".
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable analogues into robots with silicone skin that's hot to the touch, with specifically human-like reactions, performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to match their own blood by selecting everything from the robot's eye color, to the shape of the nipple and the type or color of the nail.
But with enough robots with "personalities" to make a Stepford Woman innovative, it's even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robotic silicone skins.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to customize their own robots according to character traits they find attractive (such as shyness).
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which come with pre-programmed personalities, giving the impression of shyness, including "Frijit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy" with the personality of "adventurer".
The True Companion website is thrilled: "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as best as possible".
So he likes what you like, he doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
And they have moods during the day, just like real people.
He can be sleepy, he can be willing to talk, or he can be "in full mode".
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of real human relationships, but the overly obedient female personality traits, the rape echoes of Frijit Farah's approach being the most thought-provoking.
On their website, True Companion, they describe Roxxxy as a vibrator, but for men.
"If women can have a vibrator (that's exactly what it says), why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website states.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through submission, an optional accessory.
Many men will not naturally own sex robots, and while the FRR draws attention to their growing popularity, they are currently on the fringes of consumer culture.
But leaks from the ends can be highly instructive about the course of the times in which we live.
And most people aren't weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
With a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women, it's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world.
The scariest part of The Handmaid's Tale TV series is not the detailed depictions, the fluffy corpses or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn't feel like much of a change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as much physical resemblance to real women as technologically possible (in proportion to porn star proportions, of course).
Their creators want them to feel human when they're touched and to mimic the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", the robots clearly cannot represent real women.
They can't leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activity or history, nothing to reveal their independence or to break their fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are pleasure slaves.
Or in 2017's words: the handmaids.
Attack on American military convoy, dead and wounded...
In the Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, a suicide attack targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
It was reported that there were also wounded in the explosion, which killed 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians, 5 of the wounded were American soldiers in the convoy and 1 was a translator working with NATO forces.
An official statement from NATO Support in Afghanistan said that a suicide bomber detonated a homemade explosive during a joint patrol mission with the Afghan National Army.
It was reported that the injured personnel were being treated at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
The wounded are not in any danger.
Local media reports that the suicide bomber was a Taliban member.
Trump's great master?
Making Mitt Romney look like a symbol of common sense.
The political divide that polarized the American electorate, the micro-division of families, has become a reality of the Trump era.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the US newspapers were full of how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our own so-called filter bubbles.
Less talked about is Trump's ability to bring families together.
I mention it because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has a bad relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Everyone Trump knew, including his Republican brother, who he's been arguing with for decades about politics since he came to the White House, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, of course, but it seems to me that in a broader context, it carries significant risks.
The left was revived by Trump, but the twisting effect of his presidency has created a push to the right for all of us.
When we talk about "normalcy" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his bizarre behavior may no longer shock.
There's an even more terrifying long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who defy his own standards, and suddenly it seems like a symbol of logic.
I find myself nostalgic for the weird version of Mitt Romney's insanity these days: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which are really minor crimes for Trump.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be sane to be judged to have made immeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took the kids to the roller coaster in Central Park, the largest roller coaster run by the New York Parks Department, and the best three bucks in town to spend if you don't need coffee.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the center cylinder (all clowns with strange faces and animals turning to look fearfully behind their shoulders) and the ringing music is strangely exhilarating.
In other words, many of the clichés of a city can be disappointing: the sights of high-rise buildings start to get boring, the horizon line becomes too familiar to create much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn't reach the dreamer.
It's been thirty-five years and I still can't quite get over the day I discovered that Swiss Cottage was not actually a Swiss country house but a wide winding junction in north London.
But the roller coaster in Central Park is still a weirdly magical experience, so two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go there and all have a great time.
If I could give a perfect score to a jumper, I would, but thankfully, no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to rate my "transaction experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I ran my credit card through a bond market this week.
Same thing at the coffee shop on my street corner, plus the option to match the note with a 15% tip for what you bought at the counter...
The effect of this is not only to slow down what should be a neutral shopping experience, but also to put pressure on the server to personalize an event that is not needed at all.
The poor woman in the bombshell stood up and smiled as if she were sorry, and I, bored, gave her five stars for my experience of handing her a credit card.
When the temperature passed 41 degrees , they put on their bathing suits .
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season is happening, people are flocking to the beaches of Munzur.
Young people, children, old people, women and men, who went to the beaches along the Munzur River, tried to cool themselves in the icy waters.
The beaches along the Munzur River have been flooded by Tunisian citizens living in countries like Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK, who are spending their holidays in their home countries instead of the Aegean or the Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who was among those who had a cooling off at Munzur Beach, said that he preferred Tunceli to the western provinces for the holiday, "I didn't want to spend my vacation in the west, it was better to stay in our own land".
"The ice water of the Munzur is not found anywhere in the world, at these temperatures, the Munzur keeps us cool".
Hasan Ulu, from Germany, said they preferred the banks of the Munzur River in Tunceli to the beaches of the Chesme or Bodrum and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pains .
This is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment for cuts to his wrists that prison officials said occurred after he fell in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the earlier verdict of manslaughter.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Steenkamp dead at his home in Pretoria, shooting him multiple times towards the door of a toilet booth.
Pistorius claimed he mistaken his girlfriend for someone who broke in at night while hiding in his cabin.
Prosecutors have announced that they intend to appeal once again against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they believe is too light this time.
The National Action Mercii said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal could be considered this year.
Pistorius faces a 15-year sentence if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first hajj caravan has been dismissed
The pilgrims who will go to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Presidency of Religious Affairs were bidden farewell with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport External Lines Departure Terminal.
The ceremony, which was held at the External Lines Terminal before the first hajj caravan, was attended by about 200 candidates and their relatives.
Turkish Airlines (THY) distributed roses to pilgrims who were going to the holy land by chartered plane.
The Hajj caravan in Ankara has been dismissed from Esanboğa.
The convoy included the veterans and their relatives who benefited from the "gunless hajj for veterans and martyrs' relatives" application, which was implemented for the first time this year.
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
According to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and quoted by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece on the grounds of illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August.
They were released the same day as the investigation was already underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened their controls on free camping and still impose severe penalties on those caught resting in unallocated areas.
He'll be running checks throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOE HOFFMAN, 22, and two of his friends went to Turkey in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who was driving through Adana and Mersin in a rented car, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
When his friends, who had come with him, failed to reach Hoffman despite all the calls, he informed his family in Holland.
While police are on the lookout for the missing tourist, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald have gone to Adana.
The ads have been crushed and destroyed .
Robin Hoffman, who has filed a police report here, printed missing persons notices to find his brother and distributed them in Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman said they last heard from his brother on July 8th, "We first contacted the police in Holland".
Later, I and two friends came to Turkey and filed a complaint with the police.
So far, we've had no word, no leads.
"We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found, until we get news".
Congratulations to the person who took care of Ayşe Ceren.
At the 2017 World Youth Palette Swimming Championships in Russia, national athlete Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş became the world's second in the 400 meters.
The Minister of Youth and Sports Osman Aşkın Bak congratulated Ayşe Ceren Yeşilbaş who won the silver medal with a message.
On the first day of the 2017 World Youth Palette Swimming Championships in Russia, Ceren Yeşilbaş became the world's second in the 400 meters.
Ceren missed the gold medal by just 27 laps, while she took second place with a spectacular performance on the track where she competed with 8 finalists.
Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal in the 400 meters with a time of 03.18.73, while Ceren won the silver medal with a time of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by 8 men and 8 women athletes.
His last words were, "I think I'm dying, goodbye, mother".
Among those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far been confirmed to be 30, she called her mother at the time of the fire, saying, "I don't want to die, Mom, this is not fair".
It was revealed that the Italian Gloria Trevisan and her lover were also there, saying, "Thank you for everything you've done for me, goodbye".
Dozens of people who were still unaccounted for after the fire included 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and her Italian boyfriend Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that the two young men had died, according to information from British authorities.
The lawyer said that the families of the youths are experiencing great pain and asked the journalists not to insist on getting explanations.
I think I'm going to die. Bye, Mom.
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out and that she cried when she heard these last recorded conversations.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours following the fire, which started around 1:00 a.m. local time.
Trevisan, who was said to be calmer in his first speech, said, "Mom, something bad is happening here, there's a fire".
We're trapped, we can't get out.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
"We tried to get out the door open, but there was too much smoke and the elevator didn't work", he was quoted as saying.
Gloria Trevisan, who was alarmed by the fire's growth, was quoted as saying:
Mom, my whole life is passing before my eyes.
I think I'm going to die.
I had a life to live, and that's not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hold you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, bye, mom.
I'm going to heaven now and I'm going to help you from there.
This is the Italian government's fault.
Gloria Trevisan, both studying architecture, and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi moved to London in March from the Veneto region in the north of the country after they had difficulty finding work after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who had been able to find a job in her native land that paid only $300 (U.S.), soon found a job in London that paid $1,500 (U.S.).
Attorney Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family was having a tough time financially, and that Gloria had gone to London to help her family.
Unfortunately, our youth are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
"The government must solve this problem immediately", he said.
The tragedy of Italy failing to provide jobs for its youth
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, expressed outrage, saying, "It's the fault of our government forcing our youth to flee abroad to find work".
In Italy, the unemployment rate is 12%, while the youth unemployment rate has exceeded 40%.
As the problem grew, in recent years many young Italians began to emigrate to many European countries, especially Britain.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy because of unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Commentaries in the Italian press on the confirmation of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi also said it was a tragedy of a country that cannot provide jobs for its youth.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate IBS
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products may help alleviate symptoms in those with inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the main amino acid in protein, tryptophan, helps to develop immune cells that develop a resilient gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that immune cells patrol the intestines to keep germs from sneaking into the body.
The cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote resilience, protecting delicate tissue from damage.
If the balance shifts too much towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, mice that carried a specific bacterium in their gut developed a type of immune cell that promoted resistance.
And the bacteria need tryptophan, one of the building blocks of protein, to trigger the emergence of cells.
"We have linked Lactobacillus reuteri, a bacterium that is part of the gut microbiome, to the development of a cell population that promotes resistance", said Professor Colonna.
The mice that had more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells".
If the same thing happens in humans, he suggested that a diet rich in L. reuteri and tryptophan could develop a more resilient, less inflammatory gut environment.
While working on a type of immune cell that promotes endurance, postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that one group of mice had these types of cells, but another group of the same species, kept in a different location, did not.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiome of the mice, in other words, the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
And they sequenced the DNA of the gut of the mice, and they found that the mice that had immune cells had six types of bacteria, but the mice that didn't have them lacked them.
Mice lacking a gut microbiome and not developing this type of immune cell were given L. reuteri and immune cells emerged, because they were treated in a sterile environment.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in the fluid and then transferred small amounts of this fluid to immature immune cells from mice that were free of the bacteria.
The immune cells have turned into resistance-promoting cells.
The active ingredient, when purified from the liquid, turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when they halved the tryptophan levels, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan noted that humans have the same resistance-promoting cells as mice, and that many of us harbor L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop in humans as they do in mice, but disorders in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: "The growth of these cells is probably something we want to encourage because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of tryptophan in potentially L. reuteri-presenting cases cause this population to spread".
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United have signed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40m transfer from Chelsea kicked off United's final pre-season game, a 2-1 win in Dublin ahead of Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup tie against Real Madrid, and saw him in a holding position as a forward to the delight of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic, who was left out of the Maviler's pre-season Asian tour, was seriously deficient in match condition and only managed 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that this needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, "He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius in his way of thinking... he thinks football".
"We'll help him get ready earlier".
As Mourinho began to shape his starting XI for the start of the season, Matic, like his new transfer partners Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, also appeared at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more transfers but the club insisted he had already done "an extraordinary job" by making three of the four priority transfers.
"Thank you to the club for taking three of the four", he added.
"I'd be happier if they got four out of four, but they went to a lot of trouble for me".
Last year, 197 people were sent to the hospital.
According to the Swedish Social Welfare Agency, the diagnosis of gender dysphoria for 1 in 100,000 people in 2005 rose to 8 in 100,000 in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital has received 197 referrals in the past year, mostly children and adolescents who are dissatisfied with their gender.
Child psychiatrist Lousise Frisen, who works at the same hospital, said the increase could be due to a more open society, saying that "openness in the psycho-sexual area, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general improvement in society".
It's not known if sexual dysfunction has anything to do with sexual orientation.
Drug operation in Izmir
The teams of the Office of Combating Trafficking and Organized Crime of the Odehmeş District Police Department carried out an operation on the house of 36-year-old F.T. in Ülker Street, 3 September.
A search of the house yielded 33 ecstasy pills and a delicate scale.
F.T. was caught and detained.
It was reported that F.T. will be sent to court after his security clearance.
Evkur is transferring to New Malatyaspor.
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the new teams in the Super League, has signed Turgut Doğan Şahin, who wore the Kasımpaşa shirt last season.
According to the statement from the yellow-black club, the 29-year-old winger signed a two-year contract as part of the transfer work.
"The player Turgut Doğan Shahin, who wore the uniform in Kasımpaşa, has been signed for 2 years.
Good luck to our new Malatyaspor".
The British inventor has implanted a microchip in his house and car with a hand gesture
A British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip implanted in his body, enabling him to open his front door, access his office, and even operate his car with just one hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and finger, and now offers this service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology through his company BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be performed to medical standards, Winchester collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company will also make changes to the locks on homes and cars, at £300 a lock, to make them compatible with the chip.
The man, who is married and father of a child, has this technology installed in both his home and his BMW Z4 and he drives it with his hands on the wheel.
The White House show cost taxpayers thousands
According to military records released to TIME, the White House's decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter into the southern grasslands for an organization that promotes American manufacturing cost taxpayers a figure of up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of attention at the White House, where the organization was introducing American construction programs on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured the products manufactured in all 50 states.
A helicopter made in Connecticut, a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi were on display side by side.
According to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Office requested the helicopter's presence with a separate order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south lawn for "unusual" organization.
The commander of HMX-1 sent an email to the Marine Vice Commander of Aviation, his superior, the day before the organization, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization".
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the south lawn around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event and remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
The note added that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be required for the return flight due to duty time restrictions.
The unit security personnel were on the ground while the aircraft was stationed inside, while the original flight crew were on the helicopter during the organization.
The records provided to TIME do not indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records show that HMX-1 investigated whether the organization violated this condition.
The commander wrote, "One question we asked was whether he violated the Hatch Act, and we were told he did not".
"Looks like you're locked in", replied the Deputy Commander.
The Made in America organization is designated by the White House as an official organization and not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official organizations have political overtones.
The chairman of the organization referred to the ongoing health care reform efforts in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to rein in government regulation.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents are supposed to use them to travel.
But it's unusual that they're only officially requested for a photo opportunity.
Trump gained attention in February when his presidential jet moved behind the scenes of the first campaign rally in Melbourne Florida, and his Twitter account was filled with messages about his predecessor's use of the presidential jet.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said: "The White House is excited about the Made in America exhibit, which features products made by American workers from all 50 states using American materials".
The HMX-1 crew frequently makes training flights in the Washington area and rehearses on the south lawn to drop the President of the United States on the White House on a spot-shoot.
Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July when the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
An official said the flight for the Made in America organization was part of the aircrew's training needs for the month.
The unit's helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day on "non-presidential support missions".
The White House says taxpayers aren't charged for any other tricks involved in the organization.
A spokesman for Sikorksky said his firm was not involved in arranging the helicopter's display on the south lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost incurred by the organization.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's VH-3D meet rate is $24,340 per flight hour.
Unit records show the aircraft's flight time from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia, to the base in either direction was 30 minutes.
The White House claims the actual operating cost of the helicopter is well below that.
"It is very misleading to charge taxpayers based on estimates of the cost recovery rate", Walters said.
"These estimates include sunk costs included in personnel, maintenance and annual expenses".
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's cost recovery rates do not include personnel costs but include fuel, maintenance and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated using the helicopter for this organization.
Spicer said, "The idea here is to showcase what's being done in America this week".
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contributions to our national security, and I think hundreds, if not thousands, of people's jobs depend on it.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, work tirelessly to make.
So it's obviously appropriate to bring it up".
It's unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while circling the southern grasslands for the organization, but he stepped into the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky representatives, joking with the media about the company's products in his fleet.
The president said, "I know Sikorsky very well. I have three of them".

Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brains, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the Mexican contacts and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is based in New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who provides support to American and Colombian law enforcement in the war on drugs.
Other new cast members include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women.
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all sections of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, vice president of the U.N. Relief Mission, says hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
In his statement on Wednesday, he said, "The role of women cannot be overstated".
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban threatened the election process, which coincided with the transition of international military operations into consultative functions.
This year's elections mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women will contribute to Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan reports that 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

GMB's concern over investment in McVitie's Glasgow factory
A union is demanding assurances from the management of biscuit maker McVitie's that it will make a long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross area.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products, employs more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner Pladis said they've invested more than £5 million in the area over the last few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to be informed" if there was a change in their operations.
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland requested McVitie's "address its concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being provided".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "Our members are deeply concerned by the lack of clarity from the Thesis CEO on business needs and investment plan for the future of Tollcross.
Families have been working here for generations and the labour force is concentrated in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, a critical pillar of adequate employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
From a job, wage and welfare perspective, in the face of Brexit conditions, rising living costs and chronic production declines, there is an urgent need for a four-headed manufacturing presence at McVitie's in the east end of Glasgow".
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "The plant manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and as we value our commitment to workers and union representatives the company will respond directly.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting at Tollcross with employees and GMB representatives where we discussed a few issues openly.
At that time, we told our employees that, like all companies that operate in a highly competitive and uncertain economic environment, we constantly review our operations to stay competitive, which applies to all our operations and facilities.
He added: "We have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross facility in recent years, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross' heritage as a manufacturing facility and if there is any change to our operations at the facility, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Necip and Utku are in Beşiktaş for another four years.
Beşiktaş Club has extended the contracts of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) where the data on the players is available, it was seen that Beşiktaş extended the contract with two players until May 31, 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black and white team and signed his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, began to wear the uniform in the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
The 1991-born player, who rose to captain, played a total of 254 official matches with Beşiktaş.
TFF website also reported that Beşiktaş has signed a contract with Utku Yuvakuran, who was hired last season.
Utku was removed from his temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017, and his license was renewed on August 2, according to the website.
Utku Yuvakuran played mostly in the 21st Under-21 League in Beşiktaş, where he played on loan last season.
The young goalkeeper has only appeared in two Turkey Cup matches in black and white.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar after they offer him a £189 million release clause but have they warned Barcelona about robbing the world record three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 side poised to break the world transfer record for more than double the previous amount that Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million last season, the sensational offer has set off the summer transfer window.
With PSG offering a salary of £500,000 a week after taxes, the transfer will make Neymar the most expensive player in the world and also the highest-earning professional athlete.
Barcelona are known to be angry about the style of the offer and Neymar's attempted departure, although a source close to the Catalans' management insists the club has always done its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
And was the football world warned about this scenario by the president of PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to all clubs seeking to sign one of PSG's top players.
Al-Khelaifi said, "I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will fight them, contact their players".
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, they will face the consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line earlier this summer when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear they will not let the Italian side leave under any circumstances and Barcelona are feeling the effects of this interest as they lose their greatest asset, Neymar.
The penalty for blocking the reading of the Sala was overturned
The accused, Kenan Gülşen and Nait Yılmaz, who were allegedly walking on Mustafa Baki, Imam of Küçükçekmece Gültepe Mosque who was reading the ezan and sela, were charged with "organizing knowingly and willingly, but not being members", "resisting to not do their duty" and "insulting" Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the Criminal Court.
The jury decided to fine Gulshen 7 thousand liras for "insulting a public servant because of his duty" and the prosecution of the crime, and sentenced Yılmaz to one year in prison for "resistance to not performing his duty" in view of the importance of the duty prevented by the victim.
The committee decided to convert the prison sentence imposed on Yilmaz into a fine of 6 thousand liras.
After the two defendants were fined, the defendants' lawyers appealed.
The case is pending before the Istanbul District Court.
He's in the penitentiary.
The department, which completed its examination, decided to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that the punishment for the offence of "insult" against the accused Kenan Gulshen was applied in the legal context, the action was correct and it complied with the type of crime provided for in the law.
When Nait Yılmaz was arrested by the Court of Harsh Penalties and met with Imam Mustafa Baki, "You are not throwing people out into the street".
The president is taken.
"This is over", he said, "and the act of attempting to walk on top of him, to shoot him, was considered to be a crime of resistance to do his duty".
The local court stated that despite the reasons, the act occurred when the victim finished the task of reading the sela and ezan and informed the public in front of the mosque, the department stated that in the concrete incident, there was no duty that the victim began or continued to perform, that this act constituted a crime of attempting to injure the victim because of the public duty he performed, and that the verdict was not given in a manner that would allow for the investigation of how the accused was able to admit that he tried to prevent the victim from performing the tasks he would later perform.
The department stated that the defendant had no criminal record, that the victim did not suffer material harm due to the crimes charged against him, and that the mental harm did not prevent the application of the sentence being stayed and that it was not discussed whether it would be applied if the victim had given up on his complaint.
The court, which had considered the pleas of defendant Nait Yilmaz's lawyer, decided to annul the sentence and return the case to the court of first instance.
Six Europeans on the Interpol live bomb list
The German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol (the International Police Organization) sent a list of 173 people in May to law enforcement agencies in European countries with the potential to carry out suicide attacks on behalf of the terrorist organization ISIS.
The 132 people on the list were reportedly from Iraq, North Africa, Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
Six of the people on the list were European citizens.
The victims are said to be from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The suspect is a 27-year-old German citizen from Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The person in question was reported to have gone to Egypt, Turkey and Syria in the fall of 2012.
In a statement on the social media accounts of Daesh in mid-July, it was reported that this person died in Raqqa.
The German Security Agency has not responded to the newspaper's questions on the matter.
It was suggested that the names on the Interpol list were captured in operations against ISIS in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, the American intelligence services examined the list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol was reported to have forwarded the list to police agencies in Europe in May.
The German security news outlet Die Welt reported that ISIS may be trying to send some of the names on this list to Europe to stage suicide attacks.
The horror of a soldier being fired with a pumped rifle: 5-year-old Yıldızsu may lose an eye
In Job, blood was shed in the soldier's farewell by the youths.
A crowd gathered in the park in Karadolap neighborhood to say goodbye to their friends who had gone to the army the night before.
It is alleged that M.K. and O.A. who were in the group occasionally fired in the air with pump-action rifles.
After the soldier's farewell, the group began to disband.
M.K. was passing a playground full of kids when he fired a handgun into the ground.
One child sitting on a park bench, five injured from a falling crap.
Those moments were captured on the park's security cameras.
The injured were taken to nearby hospitals by ambulance.
Yıldızsu Unus, a 5-year-old from the hospital, was treated and was at risk of losing his left eye.
Yıldızsu's grandmother, Maryam Kaya, told DHA about those moments.
Kaya, who said the incident happened while she was in her grandson's arms, said, "The soldier celebration started at 8:00 p.m".
It took two hours.
The soldier fun is completely over.
The kids are falling apart.
When it was over, we were gonna get up.
And then the gun went off, right in front of me.
My grandson is not well.
There's an 80-90% chance of losing his eye.
We talked to the doctor, he said that.
They got one of the crap out, the other one in his eye.
He said, "He's had one surgery, he says he can have maybe 10".
The suspects M.K. and O.A. were arrested by the teams of the Job County Security Directorate.
Two people were taken to court after being questioned by the police.
