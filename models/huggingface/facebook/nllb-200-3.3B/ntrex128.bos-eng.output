Welsh Assembly members are concerned about the similarities with the Mapeto
Some members of the Assembly were upset by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that they may become the laughingstock of this.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means "fool", and pwp means "dirt".
A member of the assembly from the Plaid political party said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there was little difference between the terms MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee currently working on the draft law on the introduction of name changes stated: The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the assembly will, of course, be taken by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public debate on the proposals which resulted in strong support for the appointment of the assembly by the Welsh parliament.
When it came to the titles of members of the assembly, the commission preferred the title of Member of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public debate.
Members of the assembly are reportedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach consensus could give the chairwoman, Elina Jones, a headache, who is expected to hand in a draft of the amendment bill within weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the assembly functions, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and a plan for the commission system.
Members of the assembly will have one last chance to vote on their name when they debate the bill.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed its claims to membership in the EU and the NATO pact.
Macedonian President Giorgi Ivanov, who opposed the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, the referendum's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, consider the name change simply the price they have to pay for membership in the EU and the NATO pact.
The bells of St. Martin's have fallen silent as the churches of Harlem struggle to survive.
"The older people I've spoken to say that there used to be bars and churches on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today there is neither.
He said the bar's disappearance was understandable.
"People are socializing differently now", he said.
"Bars are no longer the quarterly living quarters that people go to regularly".
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of the property won't last as long as the executives expect, and sooner or later, it'll go back to where it started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who would not help preserve the remaining quarter shrines.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore the closure of these churches will be accelerated because it is unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that worshipped nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the rector of Father Johnson's made a plan for restoration, they ordered an organ.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "the poor man's bell".
An expert who played the organ in July called it something else: "culturally valuable" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan scholar Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger organs at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church hadn't found a replacement for him.
What's been going on at St. Martin's Church over the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought in by church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Diocesan Administration  the administrative body of the diocese, composed of the church's heads  wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would  seek to pass the costs  to the diocesan administration, although the diocesan administration was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors that the diocese had sent.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
A shark has injured a 13-year-old boy during a lobster hunt in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was lobster hunting in California on the opening day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7:00 this morning near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving for about a half hour on Saturday when they heard a boy calling for help and then he and the group rode up to him and helped him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a lobster, but then he realized that it was screaming "She bit me!"
She bit me!
His entire collarbone was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water,'" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Radius Children's Hospital where his condition is being treated as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told the media that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined to be not endangered.
Giles also said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso area.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabalda to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for a period of 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's becomes a competitor to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams for the cosmetic department stores that are run by professional assistants.
As part of a significant £2.8 billion penetration of the UK beauty market, which is on the rise as sales in the fashion and home furnishing markets decline, larger cosmetic departments will be trialled in 11 stores across the country, and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetics is coming because supermarkets are finding ways to use the shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has announced that it will double its cosmetics lineup by offering more than 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in similar outfits in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line with most products being vegan-friendly - something increasingly sought after by younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume store will be testing outlets at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying smaller amounts of food daily in local stores means that supermarkets have to make extra efforts to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly look like department stores as supermarkets seek to counter the blow of Aldi and Lidl's big-discount chains with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos stores in hundreds of its stores, and has also introduced Habitat stores since they bought both chains two years ago, which it says has increased food sales and sourcing profitability.
The supermarket's previous attempt to modernize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments ended in disgrace.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenue in their stores.
The new strategy was put into place after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
It's been said that Lloyds will play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skincare products to its lineup at four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty departments to provide a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean we are now an unmissable destination in the beauty market that sets new standards for the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of his £11 million personal brand deal to focus on his deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home furnishings and accessories, Truly.
The couple's company has been compared to Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning has announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' star Peter Jones by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute to focus on her new lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant she had no time left to devote to their Truly home and accessory brand.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune which was estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of her vacation homes.
A source said: "Holly has put Truly at the very top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would ensure her income for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw stunned everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products ready to sell.
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, who is among Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the firm millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and possible additional delays to the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined in March as the company's director.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in the Baldwin production house.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Anta McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We would not comment on his business".
♪ Hard words, and then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he might get from the media for comments that could be characterized as "unpresidential" and for his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump so relentlessly fallen for it?
Trump said in his wry voice to the news reader,
I didn't give up at all.
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see an "adequate response" from the US to North Korea's initial steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he said, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to repair relations with Kim had brought positive results - the suspension of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to the Kim talks.
"It's easy to act like the president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here", Trump said, pointing to the world before him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international help, so it will be quite difficult", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Pala, they're still not sure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation on the island of Palu to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in providing aid.
With the continuous earthquakes in Indonesia, it's sad how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often seen in other parts of the coast.
Apparently, there was no tsunami siren on the island of Palu, even though the warning was in effect, so that too contributed to the loss of life.
And under ideal conditions, traveling between Indonesia's many islands can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to provide aid to earthquake victims is on its way to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-delayed infrastructure and has spared no money on roads and rail.
However, a lack of funds has hit Mr. Yoco's administration as he looks forward to a new election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from long-running sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
Over 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced by street fighting between Christian and Muslim groups, who used machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge has scored a deep equaliser against Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge receives a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team lose 1-0.
He threw the ball to his left side, then kicked it to the outside line.
The ball was flying high over the penalty area, turning to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, it fell over the Cape Arrizaballa, who was jumping, and it fell into the net.
"It was just positioning, getting the ball, and players like Shaq always go as far forward as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgium star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue forward gave Mateo Kovacic a fifth-stroke in that attack before running from the middle of the field into Liverpool's half.
The catcher touched the ball back to center field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, referring to Hazard in the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defence and ended up near the stands, kicking a left-footed goal past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool take on Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are playing Videoton in the Europa League at three o'clock on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that were collapsed by Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake and raised waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is covered by the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, after a woman was fatally stabbed.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 this morning in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the car's dashboard cameras, to contact us as they may have information that is relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the families of the victims.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just attempted to return to his apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
Residents are now being told they'll have to wait hours before being allowed back inside.
They heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
She kept saying, "This is so horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van was right next to it.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon, guarding the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 citing case 247 from September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in the Houses of Parliament has become the latest monument amid a controversy over "history revisionism"
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England by his puritanical followers in the style of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to revise history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would also become a target.
Cromwell neither ordered nor conducted the iconography during the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas from a previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more late nineteenth century than today, as the protector of Parliament from outside pressures, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and mention.
A killer pig inflicted fatal injuries on a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
A man, whose surname is only known to be Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pigsty in a market in Liupanshui city in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines into pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with a relative from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, a relative found him dead and discovered the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood around his mouth.
Forensic investigation has confirmed that a 550-pound pig fatally injured a farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and torn apart", said the cousin who gave his name as Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent any attack on other people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market owner are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 on their Massachusetts farm, inflicting critical injuries on a man.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had approached a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife had scared her off and chased her away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playing.
They like to sting, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread downpours to the southwestern United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa has weakened as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring downpour flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosina's Category 1 hurricane was blowing at 85 miles per hour as of 5:00 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and it was 385 miles southwest of the town of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap is forming in the Pacific and it's moving towards the east and west coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, combined with the coming summer, will create widespread downpours to the southwest in the days ahead.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in flooding, landslides and possible desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will result in precipitation that will reach 2 to 3 inches per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to two to four inches of rain is expected in the southwestern parts, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical tropical rainfall spreads.
Hiking in the desert would be extremely reckless with the danger of tropical rains.
Heavy rain in the canyons could result in wild rivers and thunderstorms occasionally with strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming gap will bring local showers to parts of the Southern California coast.
There's a chance of a total rainfall of over half an inch, which could cause mudslides and slippery tracks.
This will be the first wet season rains in the region.
A gentle, sparse tropical downpour will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The plumes will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October can see huge temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics still remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a prime example of the dramatic temperature variation in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will try to gather and expand again.
Early October will be warm in most of the central and eastern United States with temperatures of around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Long-range weather forecasts indicate a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's high-profile testimony in the High Court on Thursday, and that of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political dissent continues, with broadcasters suspending regular broadcasts over the latest plot twist on Friday: the deal Arizona Senator Jeff Blake made with the FBI on a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that drunken Kavanaugh had groped her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably watched by over 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company counted the viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers weren't immediately available to the other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the people who follow the broadcast from the office.
To put it another way, it's a crowd similar to those who watch the football playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose editors endorsed Kavanaugh's nomination, led the way with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's audition, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras recorded protesters yelling at him after he tried to get into an elevator to attend a judicial committee hearing.
He stood there looking down for several minutes while they insulted him, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told: "You have power while so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and stated, before the elevator closed, that he had more to say at the hearing.
Cable and television networks broadcast live hours later as the Judiciary Committee voted to send the Kavanaugh nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee next week, which a minority of Democrats are calling for.
Flake was persuaded in part by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's selection was significant because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of playing politics with Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview that is next to her on the front page, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU take tariffs from each other was "totally absurd".
Police have arrested Dyton Simpson, a suspect in the death of an LSU football player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in custody on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said that Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police have recovered the glasses from the scene of the crime and say they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS' WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, his lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department said credit was due to the Louisiana Refugee Task Force, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police, and local residents who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the county law enforcement agency for its diligence and commitment to justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "depressed and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what we've been worrying about", Wade said.
The volcano spews ash over Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatépetl volcano have reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay safe after volcanic activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been tracking multiple tremors and a thud.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering wind-driven cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity from the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after pro-independence protesters clashed with a special police squad as thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations to mark the anniversary of the polarizing Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists, held by a special police squad, threw eggs and paint powder at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, clashes broke out with police using batons to quell the fighting.
The pro-independence protesters chanted "No forgetting, no forgiving" for hours and clashed with pro-unionists who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region, which has declared independence a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, though turnout was low as opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting with violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups were camped out Friday night to prevent demonstrations and to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
Last year, we had one of our finest moments.
I watched my parents crying with happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we are in a tight spot now, he said.
Despite a crucial but narrow victory in local elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum as some of their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded the police-support protest by phone, said politicians on both sides were fueling the conflict.
"It's getting more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn backwards the democratic values and the repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities", he said.
Londoners arrested after car crash into home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm UK time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has stated that the gate is damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at some point the car was hit by a rifle.
A shot from Meng gave Livingstone a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Mage's first goal secured the win for Livingston
The up-and-coming Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 games for the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menge's goal was crucial, while Gary Holt's club was tied with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club have not recorded a single win away from home in the Premier League this season and will play the number one Hearts, who are eight points behind next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna in the Europa League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to experience a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against a guest who lacked the edge.
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored because their direct play was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a pass, but his shot went past the goal, then Alan Lithgrowe's shot went past the goal after he slipped to catch the ball that Craig Halkett headed over the goal.
The hosts were right to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for the guests from free kicks.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
A free-kick was awarded against the Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create a chance for Mangu, who took the ball and hit it from the middle of the penalty area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but the home defense remained unchallenged, and goaltender Liam Kelly hadn't had much of a problem.
That pattern continued into the second half, even though Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman was stopped by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow kicked too wide off another free-kick for Livingston.
The crosses kept coming into Livingston's penalty area and were constantly defended, while two penalties that were sought - one after a foul against substitute Glenn Middleton and the other for a hand-off - were not awarded.
♪ The phenomenal game of Livingstone ♪
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont is at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a result for Livingstone.
Each and every one of them has been excellent and continues to exceed expectations on their climb.
Their style of play and players have changed little since their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt who has been the team's powerhouse since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall off the hook for the entire game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were under Gerrard's bat from time to time, they never got to that level.
They missed the final shot  they only broke through the home line once  and this is a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne
Saturday was a day of smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city with the largest number of Turks in Turkey.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - were also vocal, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-pronged protest reflects a split in opinion about a guest whom some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others resent him as an autocrat.
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the Deptford Highway, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 British time.
The driver of the car stopped and the emergency team intervened, but the man was killed on the spot.
The collision came months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, which is about a mile from Saturday's crash.
London police have said they are working to identify the victim and inform the family.
The streets are closed, buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riot
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
A riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in the Worcestershire area on Sunday around 0930 British time and is still ongoing.
A special squad of Tornado officials has been called in to quell a riot involving eight inmates in a prison wing.
The officers suffered minor facial injuries and were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin.
Six members of the crew received medical attention for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and could face a lengthened prison sentence.
Long Lartin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was reported that the warden had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, a special task force was called into the prison for a serious disturbance in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (which may be useful in areas affected by drought)
It's rare for tropical depressions to hit Arizona, but that's what's most likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa carries its remaining power through the desert southwest, carrying with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will bring rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest projections from the National Hurricane Center predict two to four inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, up to six inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, it's likely to be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated areas.
In areas where there is no fear of flooding, the Rosina rain could be a blessing as the area is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, one part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First on its way, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which will still have the strength of a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will be moving at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean and will begin to weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a major flooding risk.
"A total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and possibly as much as 10 inches", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then head north over Mexico with tropical storm strength before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The major hazard expected from Rose or its aftermath is heavy downpours in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the American southwestern desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These downpours are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found wounded near Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4am British time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials are appealing to anyone with any cell phone footage of the event.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has endured the wrath and indignity of the Democratic Party".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and unprecedented tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Whilling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh endured the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her charges.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh that day".
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a stellar record in public service", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly touched on Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
"Even though I'm not running personally, I'm actually running", he said.
That's why I'm fighting for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump claims that Democrats are trying to "support resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number is still rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by huge waves that hit beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves up to six meters (18 feet) high hit the shore at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately flee, and were killed", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said in an address in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it carried cars, boulders, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed up the trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It's possible that the geographical position of the city, which is situated on the edge of a long, narrow bay, increased the force of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "immense" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
Bodies of several victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely cut off without any information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it could get worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Pala, even though officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor warning people in the street below in panic of the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water slammed into the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around the Palu, hampering the rescue efforts of the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for humanitarian flights only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision staff safely arrived from Donggala in Pala, where they were housed in tents erected in the backyard of the office, they witnessed scenes of destruction on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups began to take the first steps in mitigating the disaster, there were complaints that highly skilled foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we'll be open to international help, but that status hasn't been declared yet".
As the second night of the earthquake and tsunami hits Palo on Friday, friends and family of the missing are still hoping that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their harrowing story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners in the Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As a senior member of the paragliding team, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how hours after news of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel had spread to paraglider circles, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the Palu contestants who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one grey square instead of two blue square.
"I think it means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brinck worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police report.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "ran after Brink's clerk" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, police said in a statement, but did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used the name for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to promote his new album Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande, who had canceled her show for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year while discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It's been going from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye  which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without hyphens and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would never use the military to subjugate the Mexican people.
The military fired on peaceful demonstrators in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to provide support to young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government issued statements on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally has no official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: to be the world's leading AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence", Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence will happen in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s that proved superior to the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China division.
Lee paid tribute to previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when they planned the next competition to identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to go to great lengths to obtain government grants, Lee said.
"China is not taking away our academic leaders, it's taking away our corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring brilliant individuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to consolidate its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
The Chinese State Council released its plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation gives grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defense formed the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence which seeks to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it's currently investing over 100 million dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the American legislature that has been trying to form a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence for months is doing nothing.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership in the European Union and the NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents an appropriation of its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that this could jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Slav majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign for the boycott questioned whether the minimum turnout for the referendum would be 50 percent, which is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU while accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Constant name-changes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will be guided by the outcome of the vote and that the result will be decisive.
To change the name, it would require a two-thirds majority in the House.
The State Election Commission has stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when a total of 66 percent of voters turned out.
"I came to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe", said Jose Tananevski (62), a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a Macedonian referendum on changing its name, which could open the way for them to join the NATO alliance and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small stage and pulled chairs in front of the tents that were set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not at the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor, but proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will vote 'yes' because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that the result of the trial would be the confirmation of our future.
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum  which is below the required turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, it requires a turnout of 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the whole Brighton defense and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have cleared the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker receives the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defensive players before he found himself in open ground.
Aguera was then surrounded by three green jerseys.
He was running around a defensive player and was faster than a few others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English striker used his first kick in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who had a right-kicking over goalie Brighton Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that moment.
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League turmoil.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep on Brighton's side of the court.
He's got a great pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane touched it a few times before sending Sterling to the goal.
The blue-headed forward threw the ball into the net before slipping off the court.
City take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a non-competitive game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But the competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the lead on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in the game.
The Rockies at least have a direct pass for a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win their first league title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, at least we can go out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team is likely to be at its highest level ever this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under those conditions?
The Nationals still have to announce their starting lineup for Sunday, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, has been training on Thursday and will pitch on Sunday, his usual rest day.
The right-hander from Washington leads 18-7 this season with a 2.53 earned run average, 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia.
The president briefly reflected on the situation surrounding the election of his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the Republican exit in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is going to be on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important choices of our lives.
"Although I'm not running, I'm actually running because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump went on, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all possible means, you see, evil, dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they trample to get power and control, power and control is what they want, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were on a mission of "resistance and distraction".
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "violent, vicious, mean and dishonest".
He called Democratic senator and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by that name, prompting a loud outcry from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, no, I'm waiting. That was really bad body language. Worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer accepts different points of view.
Intolerant of those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party branch voted to censor me, I was not at all surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, all because we have spoken our mind.
My colleague from the House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way for standing up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors have criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and ironically, these are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice from the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting held on Friday says 'we want meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
In the eight years I spent as a local Labour MP, Friday night meetings were mostly like this.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not that way and the promise of a kinder, gentler politics has long since been forgotten, and the question is whether it ever was.
It has become increasingly clear that there is no tolerance for dissent in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues who I believed shared similar political views began expecting me to make 180-degree turns and take positions I would otherwise never have agreed with, whether it was national security or the European Union's single market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - it's accompanied by a barrage of insults on social media, calls for me to be removed from the party, condemnations of centre-right politics and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are mostly political in nature.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who deal with a barrage of sexist or racist slurs on a daily basis, but don't back down.
One of the things that has disappointed me the most about this political era is how these levels of insult have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different views and with every vote of no confidence or change in the party selection rules, the party narrows.
I've had a lot of advice and for the last two years, they've been telling me to keep my head down, be a little less loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the failure of Prime Minister Thatcher's government to literally collapse my primary school classroom, I have been committed to advocating for better public services for those most in need, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I would say that as the country is sliding towards a Brexit that will threaten our households, our jobs and our public services, I don't understand why anyone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have for you, not Momentum in Nottingham, but the voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not, is this: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that threats of expulsion from the party or political intrigue will not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: the undefeated Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have skewed the final score somewhat, but there's no doubt that Ayr has brought a deserved victory to this exciting match of the day at Tennent's Premier League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, the home team won thanks to superior defense and a greater number of chances taken, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in matches so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "To their credit, they used their opportunities better than we did".
A 14th-minute shot by Grant Naderson, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors had let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical lead and Jason Baggot caught the uncorrected shot.
Climo's penalty increased Ayr's lead before, just before half-time, he scored a solo shot that turned into a goal to make the score 17-5 to Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which turned Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long break for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on the stretcher, and in the next round Ayr increased his lead with a try from Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Ayre's second-in-command, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the superiority of the numbers with an unconverted Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts also bounced back when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a foul on Clem without the ball.
The mood shifted, as it had done almost since the beginning of the session, after Kyle Rowe picked up a David Armstrong kick in the penalty area and sent Greg Henry's wing to the fifth attempt of the host.
The star of Still Game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning he's been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, for which he writes and stars alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The Twos announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wants to get involved in the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
The Sea is Ours: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are patrolling the naval base at La Paz.
Ocean blue flags flying over public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Restoring access to the sea is our duty.
Across the Bolivian mainland, there is still a strong memory of the coast they lost to Chile in the bloody scramble for natural resources in the 19th century, and a desire to once again flood the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the greatest in decades as Bolivia awaits the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has caught the momentum, in a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course it expects a positive result", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in Bolivia's favor and claim that  after decades of acrimonious negotiations  Chile must agree to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election bid next year, also has a big role to play in Monday's verdict.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely the court will rule in Bolivia's favor, and that little will change even if it does.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is being delivered just six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law, said.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have set it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian authorities", said Zarate.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has killed the remaining goodwill of Chile, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement to the mutual satisfaction", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - uses the issue of going to sea as a political stake.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The trial is a chance to realize that we have to move past the past.
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not give up nuclear weapons as long as they trust Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made during the Singapore summit between the warring leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of re-starting stalled nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's just wild dreams that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not prepared to agree to a declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism when it comes to Pyongyang's seriousness in abandoning the nuclear arsenal that it likely sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show is introducing the latest line of giant hats that you'll soon see in the nearby shopping street.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or to completely hide from the sun, you've come to the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a line of wildly huge hats on the runways of their spring and summer 2019 fashion shows, overshadowing everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and these designers have been on the runway showing off their impressive creations.
Valentine's most prominent piece was an over-the-top hat with a wide, feathered rim that swallowed the heads of the models.
Among other bulky additions were a watermelon with a jewel, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not meant to keep your head from getting cold.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One design resembled a scuba gear with a breathalyzer and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you're one of those who follow the trend of attracting attention  you're in luck.
Those who follow fashion predict that the giant hats could be found in nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after "La Bombe", the two-foot-wide straw hat seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that created this highly impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another great creation onto the runway - a straw-colored beach bag that's almost as big as the model who wore it.
The orange-and-yellow raffich bag with ribbon and white leather handles was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to hit stores in time for next summer, as having made such a huge impression on the designer it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized fashion accessories".
John Edward: Language is of vital importance to the citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland have a record of outstanding academic achievement, which continued in 2018 with a new string of outstanding test scores, further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in the society of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired elective subject for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his language, it makes his heart sing.
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build good relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Judging by this year's test results, we see that the languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received an A grade on their high school final exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A in Mandarin at the high school finals, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that will no doubt be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as elective subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in both independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 percent of employers cited the lack of foreign language skills as the reason for the difficulty in filling jobs.
So, knowledge of foreign languages is increasingly becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs requiring knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career one chooses, knowing another language will be a real advantage in the future because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks multiple languages ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 Britons in 2013, 75 percent did not speak a second language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That's why investing in foreign language learning is important for kids today.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to the languages they learn.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more relevant to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a few languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages are of crucial importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It's got to be done right.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see the first performance of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we still don't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of pre-election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week including visits to friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
As he awaits his vote to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump plans to ramp up support in the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below live on YouTube.
Trump will likely speak about this week's hearings regarding the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, which have been tense over sexual harassment allegations, and the anticipated Senate vote has been postponed for seven days while the FBI conducts its investigation.
But the overriding purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans achieve a better result in the November election.
So President Trump's campaign said this week's rallies are being held to energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is such a crucial part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw attention from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will make his second visit this month to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, who is not doing well in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president came to try to boost his polling rating", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show a fighting spirit to keep the hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles matches
After three one-sided sessions, four-way Saturday afternoon might be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The Zamah Klatna is a completely fictional concept in sports, but one that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got the momentum right now?
"They led by six points, and now four, so you could say that the coup is on our side", said Jordan Spieth on his departure.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points up, with twelve more to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's plenty of that to give them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each taking three points out of a possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last shot and he leads by example.
The cheers of celebration grew louder during his round, until he finally delivered the decisive blow for the tie in the fourth match when he and Thomas were down two after two.
His final shot, which won the 15-hole match, was greeted with a similar cheer, one that reflected the belief that there was hope for the American team.
"You just have to give it your best and take care of your game", Spieth said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that could bring glory.
The only players to out-scor Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup main story.
An unusual but irresistible European pair won all four matches and played without a mistake.
The Moliwoods were the only pair to not play a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they've shown so far and the way they're exchanging energy with the noisy crowd have cemented them as the main favourites for Sunday and there's no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari who could carry a potential European victory as the sun sets over the course of Le Golf National.
It's best if we both go to different holes at the same time.
However, it's too early to talk about a European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overpowered Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and Swede in a hole they couldn't even dig out of.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
Four-ball and four-man games are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and don't give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a big lead going into the final day, but this session of fours also showed that the U.S. team has a fighting spirit that some have doubted, especially in the continental United States.
Europe leads 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, having won the four-ball and four-ball game on Saturday, 10-6 over the United States.
The spirited pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led by the former with two wins over the unhinged Tiger Woods, extending the previous record on the Le Golf National course to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's Europeans, in their bid to reclaim the trophy they lost at Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the flawed Americans in the morning four-ball game and won the series 3-1.
The United States put up a strong fight in the four-man tournament, winning two matches, but they couldn't cut the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team must score eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After overtaking Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they came together and overcame a tired Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more convincing 5-4
Woods, who fought his way through two games on Saturday, had his moments of brilliance, but he's now lost 19 of 29 games in the game with four fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who had rested during the morning's four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the fours and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's first and third.
Europe, however, was not exactly on track on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point lead for the Americans on Saturday.
They narrowly won a 2-1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, only to later come back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in a foursome, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from four points down before a game, even though Furyk's defending champion side has enough unanswered points to retain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems they can't counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is no talk of unilateral disarmament unless there is trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens its distrust of the United States and that under no circumstances will the country unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures in order to show goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no appropriate response from the United States", he said.
"Without having confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no question of us unilaterally disarming first".
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded for its incremental steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not throw unilateral denuclearization out of the game as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US president and the leader of North Korea on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also deafened calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is not giving up on denuclearization first and foremost and is increasing the level of sanctions pressure to force its way to its goal, even opposing the declaration of an end to the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the wildest dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If we were to negotiate this denuclearization issue with South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate".
Yet, the tone of RIO's speech was drastically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's land-based missile strike was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile-maker" on a suicide mission.
At this year's United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said more needed to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea implements denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes, let it take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are arguing that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and uncompromisingly enforced until complete, final, confirmed denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously upheld sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006 in an attempt to prevent Pyongyang from funding its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours for making "gangster demands".
North Korea, at a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "compatible measures" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to get students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning "all-nighters with caffeine".
One academic observed that students at the world's leading universities are often ignorant of basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course that he believes is the only one of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after a talk he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And finally, this girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
A first-of-its-kind course this year teaches students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and athletic performance, as well as to their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after noticing that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a dorm room, and students are asked to click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In the second part, the participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We're aware that this won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of your decision to smoke", said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in "the waking night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep, and getting it right, should be the students' "secret weapon" in fighting stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said. Even against excess weight, he said, because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, so they're hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler devise the course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course has opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate for its maintenance at the campus level.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all postgraduates to undertake a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting alarms for sleep and wake times and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
The goal of the Mengin defeated the Gerrard team
The Rangers suffered another depressing away defeat when Dolly Mengele kicked Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take their first away win since their 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side handed Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his side eight points behind the untouchable Ladbrokes Premier League leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the uninspired Rangers never came close to a tie.
With the Rangers now down to sixth, Livingston has climbed to third and is behind the Hibernians by only a goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after linebacker Calum Spence had to be rescued after being hit from the side with an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt would have been down for the same eleven Livingston players who took a point away from Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his well-trained team pressured opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
They were close to scoring just two minutes after Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a big chance and shot past the goal.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free-kick was then found by captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, only managed to kick it past the goal, near the stand.
The Rangers were able to take control, but their play in the last third seemed to be more about hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given the penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to score two touchdowns in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble defending a header by Lassana Coulibaly and taming a shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstone's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true balance of power in the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, if for no other reason, than the effort put into it.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs' deep free-throw.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Mengu for the easy finish.
Gerrard responded to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that substitution almost immediately paid off when the winger brought in Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran up from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to get the guests to play just the way they wanted to, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor held on and defended Jacobs' attack, so Lithgow could then head the ball off the corner.
Rangers' backup Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, called for another penalty when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson again failed to respond.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a stop in our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882 on this day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually become the device known as the Geiger counter.
As well as being one of the main pillars of science, the Geiger counter has a place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of the Coronado", starring the seemingly incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear with your ears the effects of atoms thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals.
Yeah, that's a whale!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot malignant cells and then kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells as part of the therapy
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from patients and replacing them in a lab
They can see a protein that's common in many types of cancer, and then they re-inject it into the cells.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, has been gone for over 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient, rearranging them in the lab so they can see the HER2 protein, and then re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them to target malignant cells has been effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a fiery speech in support of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West is being booed off the set of Saturday Night Live after a rousing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, that night, wearing a "Make America Great" hat, he insulted Democrats and spoke again of his support for Trump.
I've talked to so many white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
"If I cared about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual harassment against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes because of the hat.
They were making fun of me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head".
They were mocking me!
And then they say I've cut my hair, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that he's going to lose Superman's cloak because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His comments prompted a whistle from the audience at least twice, and the SNL crew members were visibly embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person in attendance saying: "The whole studio went silent".
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing the song I Love It disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not retreating in front of the wrongdoers".
But the host of the show, Karen Hunt, tweeted that West simply "has lived up to who he truly is and that it's absolutely beautiful".
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their intellectual) who I believe has embraced and is spreading an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be known as Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to the symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder after a person was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in the Ballyhackamore neighborhood, police said.
The accused are expected to appear at the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has condemned the toxic macho culture
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, a sword-wielding wizard in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that such roles on screen mean that boys very often feel they need to be rough in order to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture in the #MeToo era.
Whale, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, Leslie Rose, 31, admitted to having a "strong need" to address this issue.
"I personally am quite troubled at the moment by the question, 'What did we do wrong with the representation of masculinity?'", he said.
What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of toxic macho culture by featuring characters who pose as men.
He went on: "What is natural and what is the matter of education?
What is it that they teach us on TV and in the streets that makes young men feel they have to fit into a certain pattern of male behavior?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because something has obviously gone wrong for the young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not have agreed to previews or sequels of Game of Thrones after its conclusion the following summer, saying that he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
Keith is going to be in Sam Shepard's play, True West, starting in November. It's about a film producer and his brother, a mugger.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to Game of Thrones.
"In this series I met my wife, so you could say she gave me a future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the estate of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
Around 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the previous state.
Usually, in the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, year-over-year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a burning issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say that discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative attitudes in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff members leaked information about Republican senators, denouncing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff members posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles claims that these claims are being made by pundits and "trader" websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information surfaced online Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
A member of my staff  whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and inaccurate claims  is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement was soon condemned on the Internet, which was echoed by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is tinged with rage", wrote Fleischer.
This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament required for a member of Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn't do, you can't be angry.
He can't be rude.
He can't question the prosecutor's motives.
They must be calm and composed.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
"Big deal if it is true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted the appropriate authorities and judicial authorities of these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found out", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all of my staff".
Johnny English back in action movie review  soft spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It's already a tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can be applied to this sequel to the Johnny English satirical action comedy franchise that began back in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to the screens in 2011 with Johnny English: Reborn.
Will the ironic self-satire about how obviously useless we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, the bubbly, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given a new opportunity to screw up something that his name more than anything suggests is a generic comedy creation designed for territories with a cinema audience whose native language is not English.
It is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre pretensions of the highest glamour, carries within him a little Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the guy who played just one note of the theme tune to the "Chariots of Fire" at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
It's also originally based on the traveler and international man-in-the-middle veil that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest JE venture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English walked up to the helicopter wearing a medieval knight's armour and the rotor blades briefly whispered about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very odd way superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible are confidently adding comic elements.
The point is, it's a joke for kids, not adults, and for me, the wild adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's gags in the style of silent film Mr. Bean.
Now, it's a very hot topic that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, much to the dismay of the agent in charge - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw in the prime minister's cup of tea, a pompous and plump figure who is already suffering a complete breakdown due to a fall in his political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterfully played this character modelled on Theresa May, but the script is rather meager.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised and they'll have to hire one of the retired ones.
And that means the sloppy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some fancy institution, but unofficially gives lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English runs a spy academy in the style of the movie "School of Rock".
The English are quickly sent back to Whitehall for urgent instruction and to reunite him with his former exceedingly patient partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander in whose energetic and boisterous role Vicki Pepperdine is a little spent.
So Batman and Robin are once again at the mercy of Her Majesty's Secret Service and, fortunately, the beautiful and fatal wife of Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the villainous Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of comic adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a posh French restaurant, they create chaos by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht, and English sets off into anarchy by trying to get inside Volta's house using virtual reality headsets.
Obviously, a lot of effort went into that last sequence, but as fun and entertaining as it was, the whole movie felt like it was made for kids.
It's pretty mediocre quality, though.
As with other films about Johnny English, I can't help but wonder: could the British film industry devise a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really showcase his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that would see the British work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on to workers the time they've saved thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend but still receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits within the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as within the party's industrial strategy in general.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not party policy and the party does not consider it".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labour Party conference last week to lay out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the "unprivileged directors" and "profiteers" of the utility companies.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recoup their entire investments because Labour could impose "reductions" based on perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds that would allocate 10 per cent of the value of companies in the private sector to employees who are likely to take annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about whether an FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's investigation could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more forthcoming than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think, of course", said Kennedy.
Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the allegations came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was unwavering, determined, unambiguous.
However, Senator Graham's vote seems to be cemented.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is formed and would require a strong indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vigorously denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And anyone she names can't confirm that.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will be hosting the Citizens of the World Festival, an annual music event with a truly impressive roster of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the great Central Park lawn to not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to raise awareness of the event's true goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Citizens of the World Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that advocates ending poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a number of tasks or "works" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call and any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the World Citizen Project with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to take action, or just another form of so-called "clicktivism" when people believe they've done something that will change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Citizens of the World claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters advocating for a range of different causes.
They say these actions have prompted world leaders to announce pledges and policies worth more than 37 billion dollars and impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has cited 390 pledges and publications stemming from its actions, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have already directly impacted 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges included Power of Food, a partnership of investors and developers from the UK who pledged to "help children grow to their full potential", pledging to give Rwanda $35 million to end malnutrition in that country, after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historical footnote", Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman told concertgoers at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced that it will fund the Power of Nutrition project, whose interventions will touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, which reads "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world replies: "It will be a long and difficult journey, and we will fall and stumble at times.
But like all the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will be performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States Navy could "block" Russia from exporting energy.
Washington can use its navy to block Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, if necessary, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US secretary of the interior, to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where they are invited by the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe and the heart of Southern Europe", he allegedly said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to resolve this matter.
"The United States has the ability to work with our Navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open or to block them if necessary to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was speaking at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared it to Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels", he said, noting that Russia has only one fuel source, and that its economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration's mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia as a far more favorable option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unreasonable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, would make Berlin a "neighbor" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion and designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economic in nature and that it represents an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose their supplier", Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts state senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the next midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren called out President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was called in to address criticisms of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet posted Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
Yet, polling results released Thursday showed that the majority of the electorate who voted for Warren don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who are "likely" to vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed that there is greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of voters supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against the candidate.
Other high-profile names from the ranks of Democrats that have been discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin was speaking about PTSD to Traci Palin at a rally for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence following an incident that occurred Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after he's come back, I can relate to what's happening to other families that are suffering from PTSD and the vulnerability that our soldiers are returning to", she told an audience at a rally in support of President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of her son and other war veterans, added "they come back a little different, they come back stronger, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have given for this country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - assaulting a female, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence of an opiate, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a review of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a friendship brief in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who are challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner and violent members of his gang, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She's being held in a Texas jail.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained how El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, are facing a growing problem of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned an Immigration Appeals Board decision in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia's attorney general, General Carl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and in doing so the chamber violates that principle", the friendship report said.
Lawyers further argue in the report that police barring immigrants from entering the country is damaging the U.S. economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available only to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of membership in a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion", Sessions said in a June 11 statement speaking on the policy.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the death toll doubles in the search for survivors.
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palau.
Every minute, the ambulance brings the bodies.
The government is running out of clean water".
The residents return to their destroyed homes, rummaging through flooded property trying to salvage whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude quake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwight Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, are being held outside the Palua Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outside for the continuing strong aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he relates how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I'm pressed for walls", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
The US ambassador accuses China of "violence through propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in the U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday addressed the paid Chinese newspaper China Daily's ad in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's biggest selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marks, as US officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
And while it's common for foreign governments to run ads aimed at promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with each other raising tariffs on imports.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were targeted at exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and former longtime mayor of Iowa, which is a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary published in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, "is now redoubling that violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the precious American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand located down the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's troubled economic path, bearing in mind that the Chinese media is under the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has declined an offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are discouraging women from voting ahead of the midterm election with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn.
Analysts have warned that a large number of the most prominent Republicans defending and supporting Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of sexual assault, will experience negative reactions, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue are very intense and most Republicans are already showing a willingness to cast their vote.
"There's no going back on these things", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in a magazine article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute request for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to pursue Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge", Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news.
People say he's already tall, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and among the younger voters between 18 and 29, who, while they don't like the president, don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the alleged sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts were concerned that there might be a backlash if Republicans pushed through the nomination.
"This has become a major confusion for the Big Old Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the Committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also about the way that Republicans have approached this issue and how they've reacted to it", Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group, which supports the Democratic nominee, told the news channel.
Still, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided as to who to believe in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a slight tilt to Kavanaugh's side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought the same of Ford.
Following Flack's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who has made the allegation, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez allegedly claims that a Supreme Court justice candidate showed her his genitals while attending a party during their Yale studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said, speaking of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solida's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of them are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about a personal online data store is that it's entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is that Inrupt provides the resources, processes and the appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform of IBM, a number of employee development engineers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology engineers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all of their business models would be completely destroyed overnight.
We don't ask for their permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he's launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross awarded to a priest in World War I
A celebration in honour of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I fighter has taken place in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won recognition on September 29, 1918, for his attack on the towns of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won Britain's highest military award.
At a parade held Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat for which his grandfather had been awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through very thick fog and under heavy battlefield and machine-gun fire".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest heroism" led the platoon forward before rushing to the Polish cannon without help and killing three of the military unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that elicits submission".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "honored to be part of the parade" and added that the "courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give".
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 instead got Pepa Pig.
Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches, only to end up being blocked from watching the main event.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main roster and was shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am this morning, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their showdown, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the broadcast was interrupted by Pepa Prasa.
Many were not impressed that they stayed up all night until the wee hours of the morning just to fight.
One Twitter fan described the cartoon's disruption as "a sick joke of sorts".
"It's a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a program for kids", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Pepa Pig, yes. I was just about to say goodbye.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he's working on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I talk about replacing, I think we can probably work it out", Coker said.
But the broadcast is there at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, and we won't be able to get anything done until Sunday, when it's Monday in their house.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the breakup happened, there were letters going around, and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it, thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't like that, it was a matter of government jurisdiction.
I can promise you that it will never happen again.
We're gonna cut the number of fights from six to five, like we usually do, try to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality.
Olympic racer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken openly about gay rights to give others hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been absent for several months due to illness.
Appearing as a recluse on Laverne's first show, Daley said that growing up he felt "less worthy" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and the feeling of being different were the very things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was somebody", he said, so that people wouldn't be disappointed when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a very important advocate for the LGBT community and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he considered himself lucky to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "surprised him".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner who's 20 years older than him, and he said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said his "whole perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I've got to win the gold medal,'" he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie".
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to swim in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he said.
It served as the inspiration for his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which resonated with him as he prepared for the Olympics and which still makes him gasp.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 British summer time.
Mickelson out of form on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape for this to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial for a record 12th time, has been sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being the center of the action, as was often the case for the U.S., the five-time major winner spent the day cheering and improving the game's range, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the peak of his career, is not an ideal choice for the demanding course of Le Golf National, where the long, uneven terrain regularly punishes stray shots.
And if the field alone isn't scary enough, Mickelson is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari in game nine on Sunday, who, along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are 12 straight games down by four, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow", Furyk said.
He believes in himself very much.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't expect him to play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's the way it was, and we thought that's the way it had to be.
He wants to be there, just like everybody else".
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for most Ryder Cup matches played this week.
It could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-time starts, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have a guy like that on the team", he explained.
I think the younger players were fun to give him a chance, and this week, it was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage on the final day of a Ryder Cup match can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his first appearance in a match played in Valderrama in 1997, when the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished the competition with a narrow 141⁄2-1/31⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won", said Bjorn, imagined after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history and everyone on that team will show me that this isn't over.
You're going all the way tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try and win this trophy and that's what the focus is on.
I'm talking all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's across the way on the other side - the greatest players in the world".
Excited by the performance of his players at the heavyweight golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this get me down.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow is the singles match, and that's something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're testing the very limits of yourself as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get across to the players - give your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too".
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk will be asking his players to play better singles than they did in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four.
Suryk himself was on both ends of those big turning points last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser after Europe performed the "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, was encouraging his players before the final day.
We have 12 big matches tomorrow, but you should try to get great results on the road like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When he goes out with a tackle like that, he puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We've formed our lineup accordingly and we've got the guys ready so we're gonna try and do a little magic tomorrow, you know.
Thomas is tasked with attempting to counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the top half.
"I went with this group of guys in this formation because I think she can cover all the way", Bjorn said of the singles selection.
A new German warship is on standby again.
The German navy's newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it won't arrive for at least another year due to system failures and extraordinary costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship in the class of all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems have jeopardized the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, it will have a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years without returning to home ports.
Yet, the continuing delay means that the state-of-the-art warships, which were supposed to enable Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will be obsolete by the time they are put to use, states Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would render the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were especially significant because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be manned by a crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half the number of people who manned the older Bremen class frigates.
Also, the ship has been found to be significantly overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from an initial 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy "is essentially lacking ships that can be deployed".
The official said that this problem has been growing over time, because the old ships were written off and no replacement ships were procured.
He was complaining that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats.
A new study conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to find food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide for future conservation activities.
The study, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bat and the Pipistrelle soprano, and the brown long-necked bat and the Daubenton bat in Inverweed Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile searches using handheld detectors.
A careful analysis of the recordings of all the records will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what the species are doing.
Then a habitat map and report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant at the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This data will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as creating meadows, and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which negatively affects nesting and habitat loss.
Ventilators and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical treatment of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not blind.
However, because of their night-time hunting habits, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained professionals who regularly conduct checks, inspections of the cages, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve on Threave's estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a large bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the good habitat.
But there's still so much we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and on other properties is going to help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of checking for bats on the property, as the accidental destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and their young, likely wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is prohibited by law to kill, abuse, harass or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, has urged the public to get involved and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the populations of most of our species are developing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has characterized the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his 142 million followers in a video on Instagram Live, hours after the report of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports as "newsworthy".
I'm not going to do it.
What they said today, it's fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's only natural.
They want to get their name out there talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", added the player with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they called "inappropriate reporting on privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek "non-material damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the injury, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in the Circuit Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a 99% good guy who was let down by the 1%
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital photographed her injuries, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retribution" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she's now seeking a settlement of her claim because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of its car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if it loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" what Toyota UK had told the BBC - if Britain left the EU without a deal - that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnstone factory that makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis produced close to 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt to production at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Bournemouth.
Other UK manufacturers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed fears about how cross-border trade will function if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says they're going to close their mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are about what carmakers call the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a 'right on time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-built cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there could be a border disruption which, according to industry, could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that the 'Chequers' plan that Theresa May is proposing for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.
"We need to have an agreement, we want to have the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success of the moment, but to seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The case of not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what has been a hugely successful supply chain".
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the long run, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness in the market and ultimately reduce its number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the president of Unite union at the factory, said that its members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, when these jobs are closed, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We must put forward a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says
Donald Trump's highly-anticipated meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the fight continues over Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby jeopardize Mr. Mueller's independence, has been the subject of months of talk in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein also discussed wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has dismissed these rumors.
But last Monday, he was at the White House amid rumors that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would have liked to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Trump on Friday ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date for that has not been set yet, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the other things that are happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists would dispute this assertion: Sanders has not held a brief press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lower number of brief appearances was not a result of her repulsion for "theatrical behavior" by TV journalists, though she said: "I'll accept the fact that they're exaggerating".
Then she said there would be more direct contact between Trump and the reporters.
"The president has held more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him", she said without citing evidence: "We've seen those numbers".
Short speeches will continue to be held, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States a question, that's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do as much as we can, and you've seen us do that over the past few weeks, and those conversations with the president of the United States will replace briefings with the press".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences during official visits.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, by behaving in front of a gathering of reporters in a wild and occasionally bizarre manner.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers employed in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) about Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to remain after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeanne Freeman sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to reimburse the costs of resolved applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued over the summer, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a very, very, very troubled time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesseeans.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He got to the line of the court and just collapsed there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie completed his surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the nature/scale of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before the game, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher rates for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher rates when buying property in the UK, with the extra funds being used to help the homeless under the Conservatives' new plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Higher fees will be charged to those who do not pay UK tax
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn achieved by trying to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those with higher incomes.
Higher taxes will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay UK tax, with the additional money boosting the government's resolve to fight sleeping outdoors.
The surcharge, which was introduced two years ago on second property and purchases for rental purposes, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to increase revenue by up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly acquired properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to become homeowners.
Many of the country's affluent areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign shoppers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first homes.
He accused the building firms of keeping property prices high by buying land they don't use at the first opportunity, and asked Mrs May to give up her affordable housing quota as soon as possible to end Britain's housing policy scandal".
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a halt to unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would devote my tenure as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream - that every new generation should live better lives.
And that means fixing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Yet it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes as easily as British citizens.
The dream of home ownership has become too distant for many people, and the inhumanity of sleeping outdoors remains a reality".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to manage the Scotland national team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is relishing the challenge of bringing a club from the North East back to life, who are currently in third place in League One, three points short of the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I was on the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always brought me back.
However, such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in running the club".
Ross's previous managers at Sunderland have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no resentment at coming to such a big name at such a big club after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The measure of my success at this point will be 'Am I going to be able to get this club back into the Premier League?'
Judging by the structure and capabilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only consider myself successful if I can get the club back to where it belongs.
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a stint as assistant chief at Dumbarton and 15 months spent as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and St Mirren was pulled from the brink of relegation to the Championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, he remembered, taking over the club Alloa.
I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than acting.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, I made decent money and I enjoyed some solid success.
But acting can be hard.
That's how much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to be in management and now I am, and in all my adult life I've never felt more comfortable than I do now".
You can listen to the entire interview on Sportssound on Sunday, September 30th on Radio Scotland from 12 to 1pm British Summer Time.
The perfect time for a cup of tea is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to research.
The summer heat wave has boosted the circulation of Britain's struggling pubs, but it has also increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw sales rise 2.7% in July, but restaurant sales fell 4.8%, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy firm CGA, which collected the data, said: "The continuous sunshine and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup helped July follow a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs grew 2.8%, and restaurants had an even bigger drop.
The drop in restaurant sales of 1.8% in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks achieved by far the best result with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than there was a decline in restaurant traffic.
Food-focused pubs have also been affected by the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, drinks sales increased by 6.6% in a month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, from the Entertainment Content and Hospitality Analysis Agency RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% annual sales decline will be especially painful with already-existing pricing pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food-focused hosts, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide some much-needed relief.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slower growth in the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry-wide sales tracking service for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the accepted industry benchmark.
One in five kids have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have a secret social media account that is hidden from their parents and teachers, a study reveals
A survey of over 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Instagram pages.
That news has increased fears of the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "master" account that showed their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 upper elementary school students has revealed a surge in fake Instagram accounts, referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has reinforced fears of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean primary account that they showed to their parents, but they also had private accounts.
One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenager who was calling out to others with the words "rape me".
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40% of 11-18 year-olds had two profiles, while half admitted to having private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create a space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of that governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her wealth of experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh is held in high regard by the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her membership of the committee", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of sports and I hope I can really contribute to sport in Scotland".
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals, including victories in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, has been left unable to move after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover and for how long.
It was a lot of hard work, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
An ad for a traitor magazine comparing mothers to cows shares opinions on the Internet
The company that makes the traitor has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares nannies to cow-puppets.
To mark the launch of a product that has been described as "the first silent traitor", consumer technology firm Elvie released an ad inspired by a fun music video that demonstrates the freedom the new pump provides to mothers who are giving up their milk.
Four real mothers dance in the barn among the hay and cows to a song that says, "Yes, I'm smiling but I don't have a rap", and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a whim, it's my breasts".
The chorus goes: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, I'm a man myself".
However, an ad posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has elicited mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the dairy industry's exploitation.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth like us to produce milk, but their babies are weaned a few days after birth, someone wrote.
The Elvie dispensing pump discreetly sits in the breast-feeding bra.
Another commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use the publicity traitor for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another added: "Advertising without meaning".
Others defended the commercial, and one woman admitted that her song was "crazy".
I think it's a genius idea.
I'd buy this if I was still breast-feeding.
Betraying me made me feel like a cow.
The ad was a little silly, but I got it right.
This is a brilliant product, someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny commercial targeting mothers who give up milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like 'cows'".
This is not a commercial that praises or curses the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all been dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the fact that many mothers who give milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely inaudible, has no wires or tubing, and fits into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside while they're giving milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between a milkmaid and a cow-farmer, we wanted to put the focus on the milk release and all the challenges that come with it, by showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two showed up on the runway in a Marta Jakubowska creation using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly moved to a tented camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children detained has increased, though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to find a caregiver for the children.
Traditionally, most of the parents and themselves were undocumented migrants who were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by going out to adopt the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints, and that this data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress last week that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have filed for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior convictions.
Nearly 80% of people who are either guardians or members of the guardians' household are in this country illegally, and a good portion of them are foreigners who have committed criminal offenses.
"We will therefore continue the search for these individuals", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules requiring that some children appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, say the shelter workers.
Many will be calling in via video instead of in person to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those found to be unfit will be deported swiftly.
The longer the children are locked up, the greater the chances that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbursts of rage or escape attempts, according to the reception staff and reports that have been coming in from the system for the past few months.
Lawyers say that such risks are heightened in larger institutions such as the one in Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook signs of trouble.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to emotionally prepare them or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already dealing with.
Syria demands the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also serving as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.
They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally, he said in the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror in Syria is almost over, where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "the holy fight until we eradicate all Syrian terrorists" including terrorist groups and "any foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, tasked mostly with training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and blamed "certain Western countries" for spreading irrational fears "that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would be taken against jihadists and fighters from the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who would be "eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprising government and opposition members to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the Syrian government's conditions for participating in the committee's work, saying that the body's work should be limited to "considering members of the current constitution" and warning of the possibility of outside interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected for a second term
By that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal terminate his term earlier.
It would undoubtedly represent the most dramatic presidential end of all time.
So far, there's no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers on prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's the fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama "Defending Survivors", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, longtime comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Getting into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington can decide the future of Roe v. Wade's abortion law, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, and what the state of the global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury only the most privileged of spectators can afford.
And yet, you've gone a little further than general knowledge when you realize that you've spent six hours watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used deep background sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket, and the implications of the pictorial descriptions, the anatomy, of Mr. Trump given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "The Wreckers", commenting on the casting rotation and the day-to-day complexities of the Trump show.
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you're behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss' house this week, it was sunny outside on the north shore of Kauai with temperatures around 80 degrees, but he had locked himself in and was watching MSNBC and simultaneously recording CNN.
He couldn't stay away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and his future on the Supreme Court was in doubt.
I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people would say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

A massive infusion of money from the side in the most uncertain midterm election race for the House of Representatives.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th District is experiencing a cash flood, thanks to congressional redistricting that has resulted in two candidates racing for the same seat.
The recent redistricting in suburban Pittsburgh has led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took over the second district after a special election last spring.
Lamb is up against the other incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally formed in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign finance fight between the party's main fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
That position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then backed down
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners were kicked out of the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties are only being considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include both financial aid cuts and targeted restrictions, would hardly hit this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a follow-up to a similar summit last year that represented a step forward in efforts to stem the flow of migrants into the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively suspended any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.
The story
Next in line could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller has also reportedly focused his investigation on uncovering a possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia's attack on the election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of that body, just as he prepares to stand before the electorate again, and perhaps before a jury.
There are many of these, however, and I don't want to suggest that the downfall of Mr. Trump, or those like him in Europe, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, German soldiers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, provided the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or slows.
Americans are now facing multiple such tipping points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a precarious position since this paper reported last year that he had proposed secretly filming the president and had speculated that he was unfit to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
How will we react if the FBI's recently ordered investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And on top of that, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep the long winter sleep.
But I believe we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I am ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the candle for Shabbat on that table with the crowned crusader.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution is president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and author of "The Last Palace: A Turbulent European Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House".
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of the Rapids of Vienna.
Rangers host Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury has kept out a gravely-hit Graham Dorrance from making his debut this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he's confident the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to the next game.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could do something and we left with a point.
We might have taken them all the way, but all in all, the tiebreaker is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and were better.
We're going to have another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can take the three points, but it's going to be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, although, with the support of the crowd we can certainly push and achieve a positive result.
The last year has undoubtedly been difficult, starting with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we are satisfied with what we have at the moment.
The team is in good shape and the guys are really enjoying themselves; we're training well.
I hope we can now move on, put the past behind us and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of the worry about saving for retirement.
Despite the fact that the subjects had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few of them discussed this with their family members.
About half of the people surveyed by Nationwide said that they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% said they had discussed it with their children.
"People want to have family members looking after them, but they don't want to start a conversation about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance division at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care for you unless you express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to consider where and how to get it, since such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you figure out how to pay these costs.
Your long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy that would help you cover those costs, or self-insuring your own savings, provided you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Create a decision-making authority for medical care so that you have a trusted authority person who will oversee the medical care you receive and ensure that healthcare providers act in accordance with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
Consider also entering into a power of attorney agreement for finances.
It means that you choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to pay your bills if you are left helpless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical attention and is being transported to a hospital.
Could you answer a few questions about medication and allergies?
Please include the details in your written plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are", Martin asked.

A man shot with multiple shots from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot multiple times with an air rifle while walking home from an evening outing.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. British Summer Time, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to the scene.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
As the communications were down, emergency officials were unable to get any information from Donggale province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi, and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggali.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that washed up the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but over 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed by the earthquake, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police Agency.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he confiscated her phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su detention facility and has been granted a $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he pleaded "certainly not guilty" to a plea of guilty, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December of 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated related to the incident.
His girlfriend testified that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 quake that triggered the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There have been several power and communications cuts, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was directly along the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Video of the crash has been circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami washed ashore.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullah Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare conviction for a federal crime in the state not carried out since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Road in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who crossed his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted grievous bodily harm, according to the motion to overturn the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points are possible for the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "gross, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevès, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damiana Pagnucca, is stated in the request for sentence.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last had a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt fine about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment states.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visibly disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says that Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must have felt the displeasure of the Euroskeptics, as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested he should be in charge of negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "come out" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in trying to unite her deeply divided ranks was highlighted by the Remain Conservatives who joined a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain her Chequers compromise plan despite attacks from both Brexit and EU supporters and opponents.
Allies insisted that she continue with her attempts to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the Chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the meeting that "go" means "go to Solihull" and that he wants to "throw out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers".
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely inaccurate".
Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins, who was also present, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it's not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please, drop the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a blunt message, Mrs May added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage told the crowd that politicians must make themselves "feel displeasure" if they are about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people and our political elite", he said.
They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that you're not going to get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the discontent.
We are mobilising the people's army of this country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners "Tories against Brexit" after the group formed this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis has been mocking the Conservatives over security issues they've had with the party's app for the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for unimpeded border status, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit is not possible, he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran again for re-election in November against Republican House Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairing Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She's been at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters using the participatory meeting format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren countered that it was time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the head.
Arrest after LSU's Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyton Simpson at an 11:00 a.m. press conference.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released, asking for help in finding the man who appears on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, according to 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and Simpson hit him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene of the crime, to possession of a weapon, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 assists and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closing in on the world title after his order secures victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the order of the teams will play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton behind to engage in the traffic on the back of the grid, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after wheel-by-wheel action that unwittingly forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior open at the risk of falling behind after a double-header in defence of the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race relying on his tyres to get to the quick finish and overtaking Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally made it to the pits in the 44th round, but failed to pick up the pace in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a gentleman to let me pass.
The team did a really remarkable job to achieve a one-two formation finish", Hamilton said.
That was some bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinsten at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate is showing that people are "wicked, evil and deceitful".
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and deceitful and lying", he said.
When you look at the posts and the information that they've leaked to the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release information to the public?
You remember her answer... did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no, you won't.
I didn't release it.
Well, hold on a second.
Did we let... No, we didn't", he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, which leaked in early September - though Feinstein denied the information had leaked from her office.
I didn't withhold Dr. Ford's testimony, I didn't release her story to the public. " Feinstein told the committee, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, like she asked.
But her denial fell short of the approval of the president, who commented at a rally Saturday night: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president insinuated that Democrats were exploiting the allegations to their own ends.
They are determined to take back power at all costs.
You see the malice, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get to power and control,  Media reports the words of the president.
Dundee Stars to Belfast Giants, five to three.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have made up for their defeat by Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning 5-3 in a replay at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early on with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before Dwyer regained the lead over the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Lunvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Premier League season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwayer opened the scoring in the fourth minute, 3:35, with an assist from Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the crowded start, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 1:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie it at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer had secured the Giants' lead by the first break with the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalised them in the power play with a goal at 27:37 minutes.
Cownie and Charles combined to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored a fifth goal midway through the final period to secure his side's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will be facing Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane avoided an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been declared a hero after he died ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area, with many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Pallu Airport, which was rocking violently.
He stayed behind to ensure the safe takeoff of Batika Air Flight 6321, which was on the tarmac at the time.
When he realized the control tower was crumbling, he jumped off it.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palua.
"Our hearts are breaking for this news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the state disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The number of victims is believed to be continuing to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many are inaccessible", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching 20 feet in height have devastated Palau, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working in haste to provide aid to survivors, but we don't know what they will find there".
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work full-time on all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?
Indonesia was struck by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air New Guinea reports that after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one person is listed as missing.
The airline whose plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is saying that one person is listed as missing, after earlier saying that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
Air Nugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to track down the passenger.
The airline says it's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local floats helped rescue other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six more passengers were hospitalized Saturday and that all are in stable condition.
It's still unclear what caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events was.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in the lagoon before it could reach the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes stated that the plane was very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to make it to the emergency exit through the waist-deep water in the plane that was sinking.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working nearby on dock repairs also helped with the rescue by using inflatable boats to ferry the passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that none of them involved Air Niugini.
An analyst is reconstructing the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The U.S. Attorney's Office on Saturday closed a case in a retrial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He testified before the jury that he used cell phone data to piece together the movements of the accused Quinton Tallis, 29, and the victim Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambers' at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford stated that he was lying because "my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers had met her approximately two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett says that Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, calls and contact information from his phone for a period of time after Chambers' death.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense should begin with the closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects a jury trial to follow later today.
The High Breed: What is enlightened hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to challenge the negative attitudes towards the genre by filling its compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when it dealt with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and bring back the popularity of hip-hop.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common are gaining popularity again in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues a couple for firing after a racist text message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "just another black person".
The couple denies being racist, calling the lawsuit a "waste".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she realized after her arrival on the first day of work in 2016 that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"There is no more one story", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she became aware of her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, had been doing a poor job and was expecting a Filipino instead, the New York Post reports.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in a sum.
Maurice is now suing the couple for severance pay, as well as a $350 per day for six months, which she was originally hired to live with the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, you see, you can't do things like that", she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by saying that the cancellation of Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after having insulted her, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", he told The Post, his husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you trust your children to someone you've offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Give it to me.
Dismissing the lawsuit as "harassment", Plasco said that his wife had only received two months of maternity leave and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
"That's not very nice", the investment banker added.
Although the court case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success.
Saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book by a little teddy bear, would still be positive if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with both happiness and sadness following his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
"He was a quiet man, he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like your child had accomplished something and you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although he was the product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye over the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad had been calling regularly to say that he was in bad shape, and that they didn't expect him to survive", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad called me to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did that, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications her doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly stopped working and no longer flowed through her bloodstream.
She died just moments before that, and everything went dark.
I could just sit and wait, knowing what was coming.
I couldn't scream, shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be collected.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea of the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew", she said.
"I bowed my head, and tears were pouring down my face.
It's hard to explain, but over the summer, I was overwhelmed with compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Bereaved women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression until he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up any room.
However, before his death, he left the job because he was in a "very dark phase".
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about the repercussions".
Mrs. Davis designed these cards so that people would know that there is someone you can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit and be silent - talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was moody or depressed or anything", she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at the bottom of the barrel at Christmas - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they have to get over it: "It leaves a huge hole in the family.
It's what makes us tick.
But we'll keep going and fight.

With the FBI's investigation now open, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
"I thought that if we could really get something out of what he was asking for - a limited-time investigation and scope - maybe it would bring us together somehow", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the board would "break up" because of irreconcilable partisan views.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers not want an FBI investigation?
Their restlessness is caused by a choice of moment.
Congressional elections are just five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans go badly, as expected, their attempts to get their man elected to the highest court in the land will be severely undermined.
George W. Bush on Saturday called senators, lobbying for support for Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The vote will be in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast his vote and confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is dropping under Kim.
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug said that 1,127 defectors were recorded last year compared to 2,076 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that two of the deciding factors were the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs that people smugglers charge.
Pyongyang has not made public its position.
The vast majority of the North's refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have noticeably improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where a broad consensus was reached to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress so far on US sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, it is not possible for us to be the first to unilaterally disarm", said RI in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and gagging when he spoke about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he's going after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi backed off.
"I'll say this - if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court, not in the court he's on", Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, considering him a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about whether he would overrule certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to be put on trial and we're expected to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justified anger, anger that's been building up for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, what are you saying?"
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was somewhere a CEO, and who said that she also cries when she's angry, but that she developed a technique that understood that when she gets angry and starts crying, the person she would talk to would say, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was angry.
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great.
Tears are a permissible way to vent anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories from my earlier work, in a male-dominated office, is how, one day, when I was crying from an indescribable rage, an older woman - a cold boss whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"I never let them see me cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, was working with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
When in 1987 Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on board the Moneky Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found no reason not to consider running for president herself.
"That was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was already in the works, she was behind on her fundraising, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who had given men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not be launching an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger at chauvinism - that it choked her.
"I think you'd have had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my memorial?
"She cried?"
How a trade war between the US and China could be good for Beijing
The first cannonballs of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the end of the battle is still in sight, the rift between the two countries could be good for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest hit came this week with new tariffs hitting $200 billion in goods, which is practically half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated with the same measure every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate with the U.S., and the world's second-largest economy seems unlikely to be doing so any time soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means meeting demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move well, US acquiescence in the trade war could positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of a steep economic decline in either country is actually much more dangerous than observers have believed", said Abigail Grace, a research-focused Asia researcher at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to allow refugees to return, the foreign minister says.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country devastated by war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would benefit from help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or the help of countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe took the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling all tournament, made his first shot, a shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in this format in 1997.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Throbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, whose Ryder Cup may have been his last.
Eight-time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia of Spain became the all-time leading scorer in European tournaments with 25.5 career points.
I don't normally cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
"It's a team here and I'm glad I could help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
The relay is handed to his fellow countryman John Ramm who defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in singles matches on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team has been struggling all weekend to find their way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing top-flight golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to have been their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're being played.
The latest news on the sea bloom: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manteo and Sarasota.
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decline in seaweed concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, sporadic blooms have been reported in the areas of Pinellas, Mentee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The sea-flowered area stretches for about 130 miles of shoreline from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Surface blooms are occurring about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Sea flowers have been reported in Pasco County.
