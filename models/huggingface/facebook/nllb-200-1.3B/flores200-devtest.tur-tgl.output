below are the more moderate cats, who eat prey of average size, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats that are released) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special business that each cat owns and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called herds.
The lion herds consist of one to three adult male relatives, with a female and cub around 30.

Lion herds behave very similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also very lethal to their prey.

When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from their original population (for example, if they follow a stream or river, or move to a new island where it is not easy to return), they will usually find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they've needed before.
The original population has not changed. They still need the same adaptations as before.

The overused and often over-typed rule of three is a simple rule that creates dynamics in a photograph while maintaining scale.

During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was brought under control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has held together the nations of Europe despite differences in language and traditions.
The all-pervading power, influencing everyone from the king to the common man.
one of the most important beliefs of christianity is that wealth is used to alleviate suffering and poverty and the church's capital is used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money here has led many to question whether this principle is being followed.
Immediately after the war began, the UK imposed a naval blockade on Germany.

UK threatened even neutral ships by laying mines in international waters to prevent any ship from entering the entire ocean.

n the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolation.
The nations that witnessed the horrors and persecutions of war in World War I wanted to avoid facing such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company, located in New York City.
came to the US with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of reference written by Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, with the most famous being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.

After the Revolution, jobs were open to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and successful would win.
The same is true for the army, because the rankings are no longer based on the Cailaber.
The French Revolution also inspired many members of the working class who were oppressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life. He would often visit a cave on Mount Nur (Light) later called Hira to immerse himself in thought.
The cave itself from that time provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.

The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The magnificent pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and much of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family heirs.
The upper bow sign appears as a V, and the "bottom bow sign" appears as a stick or a square with the bottom missing.
means that you should start at the top and push the bow, and then you should start at the bottom and pull the bow.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more definite.

To understand the Templars, we must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the cult.
The period in which the events occurred is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the time period of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in European history (AD 1000-13000).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500 when the treaty ended.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a very wide range of ideas in practice, including views such as the technological drive or the inevitability of technology, which holds that the fate of people is determined by a logic that is unconsciously bound by scientific laws and the application of these laws to technology.
TECHNOLOGY DETERMINISMMost interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has some "impacts" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
Someone might say that the motor car was necessarily pioneering the development of roads.

Car ownership also leads to more accidents on the road, leading to new techniques in the healthcare industry for repairing injured bodies.
Romance was characterized by a broad cultural determinism passed down from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, traditions and culture developed that were more in line with the location of society and better than arbitrary laws.

Around 400 C.E., it gained a reputation as a center of luxury, and it maintained that reputation until about 1100 C.E.

The title of fashion capital has shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.

nce communication channels are slow,the western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Through the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, and with the end of the Crusades, one of the greatest advances of the period was the use of buttons to pinch people's clothes.

Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system whereby seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods are used to obtain maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence farming, and this is still true in many developing countries today.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel excluded by social standards and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The attributes that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various factors.
members of a subculture express themselves as part of that culture often using a different and symbolic style that incorporates fashion, attitude and slang.
one of the most common ways to show the importance of socializing is to point out a few unfortunate cases where children are socialized by adults through neglect, unwittingly, or deliberately abusing them.
Some wild children were confined to enclosed spaces by humans (mostly their own parents). In some cases, the abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe mental or physical disability.

others are said to be raised by animals. some are said to live on their own in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, a feral child exhibits almost entirely self-rearing behaviour (to the extent that physical limits allow), such as fearing humans or being insensitive to humans.
project-based learning takes a step further in making learning easy and engaging, while guiding support goes a step further.
Support is not a learning method, but rather a support to individuals who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Routing support can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a router, but so is the little attaché guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are built into the software and are designed to question, guide and explain procedures that can be challenging for the student to handle alone.
children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even robbery.
No child should grow up in a place where there is no protection, no compassion, no education, but unfortunately, that's not the case.
We see the Protective Family System as a safe zone for these kids.
What we expect from our family system is safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.

Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
andsocial are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).

The use of video images has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
It is suggested that the correct interpretation of micro-statements can determine whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article called The President's Speech, noted that people who have trouble correctly perceiving speech due to brain damage can correctly assess intimacy despite this problem.
He even argues that animals, like dogs, might have the same kind of abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th century research has shown that there are two different genetic variation pools: hidden and extroverted.
change creates new genetic difference and selection removes it from the pool of expressed difference.
Each generation, the divergence and re-merger between the two pools mix up the variation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans is unlikely to meet its amino acid requirements with the available plant sources.
Plus, failure to do so has serious consequences, such as growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources to access might be proteins from leaves and legumes, but it's unlikely that plants could be digested by primates like us without being cooked.
The food of animals (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.

Sleep interruption is the process of consciously waking up during normal sleep and falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (up to 60-minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quieter alarm clock to just clear your consciousness without waking you up completely.

Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known deodorant) before bedtime and forcing someone to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the current life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.

September 17, 1939 Polish defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.

The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods over the oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to protect your country's ability to transport your people and your goods, and to interfere with the enemy's ability to transport their people and their goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic front of World War II, where the Americans were trying to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to bring aid to Britain.

It is estimated that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began feeding them with milk, wool, meat and mail for easy access.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasture areas, often by child or adolescent goat herders, similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
Carriageways were not built in England until the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were just parallel wooden beams, the horses pulling them allowed them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than the slightly more rugged tracks of the day.
Travers were used to hold tracks in place at an early date, but over time it was discovered that they could be more efficient if there was an iron strip on top of the tracks.
This became a common practice, but it caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the iron wagons.
As a result, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were put into use.
The earliest known means of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, meaning "upright man".
The previous generation of Australopithecus, was unable to walk on two legs normally.
The earliest known use of two legs is in Australopithecus, dated to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.

"Dunlap broadsides", 150 to 200 copies were made in one night.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6 to read to his troops in New York on July 9 and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The earliest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap pamphlets, which are still extant.
Today, most paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Most people don't think they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.

The most common symptoms of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the poison in question.
The term insect is used officially by entomologists for this species of insect.
The term is derived from its ancient similarity to the woodpecker (bed bug), which has adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both Killer Insects and their woodpeckers are native plants that have adapted to living in their nests or homes.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, meaning that the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults is multiple sclerosis (MS).

Couples may decide that having a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples can choose to plan an adoption for their baby.

The basic purpose of science is to discover the scientific method for how the world works, which actually guides most scientific research.
Experiments are tests that are used to test one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to guide scientific research by observation.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
He accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including the science of the soul.
As Greek science declined, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
The many rhythms observed in physiology and movement are largely dependent upon the existence of internal cycles and the production of these cycles through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which do not respond to external periodic cues alone, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, continuing a period of free cycle even in the absence of signals from the outside.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals for DNA as genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, either tagging the DNA in a radioactive phosphorus phage or in a radioactive sulfur portein phage.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether or not the affected cells are germline cells.

Another example is visiting the orangutans in Borneo, taking photos and learning about them.
Taylor: Every morning, people get into cars to go to work, they leave the small rural towns, and they pass other employees who are going to the place where they just left to go to work.
In these dynamic inter-modal transport journeys, everyone is connected and supports a transport system based on private cars.
science shows that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the stable biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
everybody's a part of society and they use transportation systems.everybody almost complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of this level, like water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are transport systems getting so many complaints, why are they failing on a daily basis? Are transport engineers inefficient? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks to the fact that drivers tend to behave in a reasonably stable range, traffic flows tend to have acceptable consistency and can be described roughly mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics are identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps with the planning, design and operation of the road infrastructure.
The first animals to fly were insects, whose flight abilities helped them escape enemies more easily, finding food and mates more easily with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider and smaller range to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are the jellyfish and the mayfly.
