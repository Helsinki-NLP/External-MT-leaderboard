The Prague stock market at the close of trading had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed losses.
The transactions of CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse the day before, when it was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of the stock market on Wall Street.
We also see a market reaction to the result of the vote in the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Shares fall in Asia
On Tuesday, the Asian stock market experienced a dramatic fall, although the indices, however, later erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cleared almost 4%, but later also part of the losses, stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8%, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end the losses stood at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan stock market, according to the local index, has fallen 3.6%.
"The planning of the bailout is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world", noted Hong Kong's head of the Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, manages its own monetary policy, so it is independent of the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
The US legislature, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return to dialogue quickly and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will suffer the consequences.
Theft of American shares
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which was to be financed with 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion Czech crowns).
The lawmakers thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks were in a deadly slump on Monday, with major stock indexes recording their biggest drop in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7%, and a similar fall was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not passed, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the US government can give out 700 billion dollars to the banks.
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be taken early next week.
The US legislators broke the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system totalling 700 million dollars (almost twelve billion crowns).
But it's not said yet.
So, congressional representatives have to define some details of the agreement before they publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial support plan will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
So said Sunday to Reuters, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank.
In the Senate, according to some sources, a vote on the plan could probably not be taken until Monday.
The economists believe that the announcement of the approval of the financial plan should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can awaken the financial markets.
But then we will have to return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, we can get help from the markets.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great step forward".
"We've clarified our different views on the form of presentation of the market stabilization package", Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same , the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislators met overnight Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government's financials.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses for financial companies and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
"We are in the final agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market".
"We still need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we're there", Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has had a strong impact on the stock markets, which are plummeting.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, which are, in chronological order, the first to affect the market on Monday following the congressional decision.
But it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill and whether negotiations can be halted at the last minute on any issues.
The lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
But the law is still going through a lot of changes.
The total amount of support for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the remainder of the money if it feels that the program is not doing its job, blocking the next $100 billion and then the final $350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
While the President may veto this decision, Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program has remained, which is to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage securities, whose price has plummeted because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", as the Republican senator mentioned.
President Bush is also satisfied with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday's positive outcome and appreciated "the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said that the legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closing of the budget for cuts, the splitting of the financial plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the executives of the companies participating in the program and is creating a committee to oversee the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard and we've made a big step towards an agreement that will work and be beneficial to the market and also to all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners who have payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the goal of lowering the monthly installment charges for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price the problem assets will be bought
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will share the losses", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, this week, congressional representatives should find agreement on support for this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time most important", Marek stressed.
Duel of the last blood: MP3 players versus cell phones
We will advise you on how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It is clear from this that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons for acquiring a standalone reader.
The choice depends entirely on the use and the needs of the future owner.
You might not buy an expensive high-quality record player to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
First of all, these musical products are not released as LP's and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
But if your shelves are crammed with hard-rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of a record player like this.
It also works with portable music, i.e. music in a compact format or simply in MP3 format.
Here too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to digest the 20-crown headphones on the market.
Two extremes between which there's enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It's the battery life that determines.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply read music, something that mobile phones do not even accidentally do.
There is no other device today as universal as the mobile phone.
Besides the basic functions, calling and texting, it can read music and video, record both, and it has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse, and maybe even navigate.
And if you take smartphones and handhelds into account, you'll also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the screen will require charging.
And reading music takes a lot of energy.
Few phones can read music for more than 12 hours, usually, and much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap cell phones, don't count on them lasting more than a few hours.
If you add a few more calls from time to time, get another charger at work for safety reasons, even for the most expensive appliances.
But you won't have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least nine hours of continuous playback on a single charge.
Another problem arises when music is downloaded into a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port, and not all can be connected to a computer without special software.
Music can certainly be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do so without the mini-card adapter that is not used in mobile phones.
Readers, with a few exceptions (iPods), do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create a multimedia library of their own, sorted by the names of the performers, the name of the album, the genre or the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to use, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you should be especially concerned with battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output, and clearly ease of use.
If you want music mostly as a background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, you just need any MP3 player phone.
This is now clearly possible on any mobile phone.
You don't have to worry too much about what formats your phone or your reader recognizes.
MP3 players support all of them, so the majority of the music that you get will be in this format.
In addition to this format, which is one of the most common, the vast majority of devices support music in WMA format.
The AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is missing.
The best cell phones also allow you, for example, to buy music online.
You just have to visit the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile internet network and buy the song or album.
This service itself could be a good reason to buy a mobile phone reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is meager and is usually limited to the hits of the moment on the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very mode of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones with them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something, just grab it in their pocket and leave the MP3 player at home.
But it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your wireless earbuds.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small portion of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile phone readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For three or four thousand crowns you'll already buy a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the lack of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped cell phones, and even with the 3.5 mm socket for ordinary headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The advantage of the readers is, among other things, the ease of use.
The simpler ones, not necessarily the cheaper ones (see our selection), are really handy for anyone to handle.
The minimal features, the similarity of the handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the record player, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the mobile internet start-up and consequently a huge data transmission bill.
What device to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
The purchase of the card is also included in the 2 000 SEK.
But be careful
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can even do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, go to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or whatever.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, you may prefer to buy specialized walk-man phones (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service thus approaches the same MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson has come a long way in this area, with the walkman line of phones having the same usage scale as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide the same service and price category up to SEK 4 000, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, generally up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe I should .
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all the services as their Western European counterparts.
However, there is something missing here: a virtual operator that forces the traditional ones to lower their prices.
Maybe he won't be gone for long.
We have already written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in the EU than in the rest of the EU.
After the latest steps by the European Commission in the field of roaming tariff regulation, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
This may sound absurd, but we have three mobile networks here, and coverage is well over 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telephony operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is also often emphasised by the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who has sometimes expressed in the past that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably no longer has many possibilities (and it would probably be difficult to find other frequencies).
But there is another possibility - the virtual operator.
The very entry of virtual operators into the market led to a significant price reduction, to which traditional operators would have had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices were sounding in Britain as we are.
But it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be really successful.
We do not have to go very far in the example.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
In just six months, the operator has managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic is owned by U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is that they can concentrate on a much more concrete target group.
In order to operate effectively, it needs far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
There are no relatively high costs involved in setting up, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators usually come in cheap, offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the more restricted offer of services.
So for example Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that costs at least half of its competitors.
But as Mobilking's example in Poland shows, betting on a not-so-small-handed group can also be a pretty good move.
This operator is aiming, so to speak, specifically at men.
"Real men choose a Mobilking operator that they like and can trust", says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can say the same as in Poland.
Vodafone's press spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, which is the basis for most virtual operators.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of services".
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk of expanding this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very hopeful.
The activation of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area", said Jana Studničková, the press spokesperson for the financial group Penta, in a telephone conversation with Mobile.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very supportive of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything because it creates no potential competitor.
For some time now, it has been keen to launch a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them,' says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
So maybe better times are coming.
The first virtual operator is expected to be available by the end of the year, according to unofficial information.
But for now, an impenetrable wall of silence is building around his creation.
'At the moment we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no one with a complex and serious project has come to us", said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefónica O2 in a statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: 'At the moment we have not noticed any viable and mutually beneficial commercial project on which it is possible to continue building.'
He adds: 'It is unlikely that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point we should have had a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be considered on the horizon.'
Vodafone concentrates its attention rather on meeting its own 3G licence requests.
Miroslav Čepický adds: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the customer's point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for high-speed mobile internet".
Competent authorities - with the accomplices
The attitude of mobile operators is easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
Why, then, facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The problems surrounding the creation of U:fon are evidence that when operators care about one thing they know how to row in the same direction.
Perhaps the great pressure was on ČTÚ during the period of U:fon's creation towards the T-Mobile company.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the ČTÚ web pages.
But now U:fon is the argument against accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: 'The competitive environment in the mobile telephony market has recently been strengthened, above all with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on it and especially on its services.'
The attitude of mobile operators is, however, surprising in that the Czech regulatory authorities are completely disinterested.
It is not just the attitude of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere with economic competition.
That is the exclusive responsibility of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This is a very important point.
'The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the lease agreement for the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers was probably not attractive enough for traditional operators", said Kristián Chalupa, of the ÚOHS's external relations section, in response to our question.
This statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive on the protection of consumers' rights.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside the country where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services".
But of course pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and price reduction are not in ÚOHS' interests.
What is really shocking about the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three actors resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Like the fact that the price of petrol is the same for all petrol stations, it is certainly the result of coincidence and competition.
'The Chamber has not found any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position and therefore no correspondingly greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The telecommunications regulator may also lack the tools necessary to open up the mobile network market to virtual operators,' Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of the many controversial issues .
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has, after all, logically, a monopoly on its network.
So for a certain portion it has to be dominant.
But even if we did not admit this argument, it should be a warning sign for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are proceeding in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, the complaints from interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all operators.
The fact that the responsibility for telecommunications is transferred to ČTÚ is a common trick by which ÚOHS keeps itself out of the whole affair.
We have seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the extension of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not promoted until the recent update of the Telecommunications Act, despite the fact that many experts expected this to improve the situation.
The representatives of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be well aware of this fact, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
You can do it when no one's watching
We do not see the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephony services, but these are only partially public.
These are usually companies that do multi-level marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the people who have been appointed.
The magic is that the company is represented to the operator as a classic corporate customer, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
How a major customer then gets special price offers (and so on).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
"If the cases you mention, which we will be interested in, arise, it could be a breach of the contractual terms and could lead to the termination of cooperation with this company", Martina Kemrová answered the question in question.
But it is unlikely that such activity would not reach the ears of the responsible parties of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator is simultaneously defending itself against such an attitude.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Member States.
Miroslav Čepický warns of potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have it in full as regular customers of mobile operators do.
But that's what should be a little strange at ČTU.
In addition, another issue arises for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to this attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It should be added that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to it will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we 're not more expensive
As has been stated several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a significant reduction in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were almost identical - market too small, the threshold too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
But in developed countries, regulatory bodies have intervened in these cases to protect not mobile operators but their customers.
Both formal measures and informal pressure led to the creation of the first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing themselves at each other like a hot potato all the time.
In our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competence in these cases makes them more than comfortable.
But let's not give up.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator really appears soon, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, ÚOHS could hardly remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of the other operators concerned.
And maybe we'll stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj" in a solemn way on the occasion of the Czech State's Day of Recognition.
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available  solo with male or female vocals, choral pass and instrumental editing.
The song is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has already told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he has chosen specially to sing the solo variants, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to make sure that both the choir and the singers had clear diction, that the lyrics were clear, that they were in harmony", he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original Fidlovačka opera by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "New" Anthem Is Played
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers on the subway, tram and bus will have an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
Right now , it 's available to about 100,000 people who have their own Opencard .
Passengers can buy the 30-day and 90-day and annual (starting from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoint and the offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stops.
The coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers before noon.
Those who start using the service via the Internet can completely forget about the ticket counters at subway stations where they used to have to wait in long lines for paper tickets.
The ticket is purchased online and uploaded to one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers have a trained desk staff that will help them with their internet purchases and will also record the credit on their card", said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition, in libraries it will be possible to load the electronic vouchers onto the Opencard ATMs and self-service machines installed at the metro entrances.
What are these ATMs like?
They are red, resemble ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be 80", concluded Opatrný.
The ticket will be checked by the ATM instead of the driver.
The ATM service that will be running from tomorrow is very simple.
Just put in your Opencard card and after paying the coupon, it will be loaded on top.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
This is the case on the urban train and bus lines from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to Prague's integrated transport there are card readers to check the time and zone validity", explained the ticket checking method of Filip from the Ropid organisation, which sets Prague's public transport schedules.
City buses have card readers integrated into the driver's trunk.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the specified point next to the cash register.
The driver checks the validity of the loaded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information", Drápal added.
Passengers who take the city bus and do not remember when the ticket expires can go back to the self-service ATMs, where the ticket is loaded onto the card.
Here, information on the validity of their documents will be displayed on the device's screen.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is according to the letter deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also evident from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Czechs in Český Krumlov ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sumava district"  occupied by Hitler under the Munich Agreement  to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter, signed "People who hold the fate of Šumava with all their hearts", reads.
Since, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - gives the Sudeten Germans hope only in brutality, lack of regard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to assume the protectorate of Šumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the Allied victory", the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge on the part of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president should doubt the German belief in Šumava, he would simply organize a referendum in the district on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the US or live under US rule.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, some witnesses say it adequately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had a slight sense that it would be their move from the republic, few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others thought that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German from Budějovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and put in the Holštýn prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to see him so that he could teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they got home, the Czech would be convenient", said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he said, had counted on the fact that on the basis of the Beneš decrees they would be moved out of the Republic.
You'll pay for it!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
Even so, the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch an emotional media campaign on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that this will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million campaign will be shown on television, radio, cinema, internet and on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol.
And remind them to put on their seat belts before they leave.
It is intended to reach the consciousness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What's going to be in the commercials?
Especially stories about people who will affect your emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You'll pay for it!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you'll pay".
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The ads will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to see images of the victims of accidents with dramatic scenes.
This is a promise to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carriage and driver's stick
"The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they go through the red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risk", says transport ministry psychologist Martin Kořán of Na Homolce hospital.
And so we need press campaigns and especially negative publicity, the psychologist believes.
He says that the signs warning drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning sign has been installed, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it", Kořán warns.
Olmert would give back most of the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The Prime Minister of the Israeli provisional government, Ehud Olmert, has spoken in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between the Palestinians and the Syrians.
So said the dialogue published Monday in the Jediot Achronot.
"We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) areas, if not all of them", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the same percentage (of Israeli areas) to the Palestinians, because without that there will be no peace", he added.
He has admitted that any return will include East Jerusalem .
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want to be passed over by the robbers or the spies, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem", Olmert noted in reference to the two attacks in July in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, "a special solution will be found for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places", which are located within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,' he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was the precondition for concluding this peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose concluding peace with Syria solely on the basis of withdrawal from the Golan", he warned.
"The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up the permanent support they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (the Shiite movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq", the prime minister said.
Is it illegal to have stewards on buses?
The law does not recognize them, you can't walk on the long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency bus, the question arose whether the stewards and passengers could move on board the bus during the run.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the traffic law", says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week in which a 22-year-old hostess lost her life was caused by a truck that cut the bus's path.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the least secure seat of the bus at the time, despite the fact that there were two other seats still allocated.
But the bus can also crash or brake abruptly while delivering coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus has standing seats according to the driving licence.
If not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The buses of the Student Agency have no standing places, the director of the company Radim Jančura confirmed to the website Aktuálnĕ.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry and at first they did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
It was later revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the toilet during the race if they have their seat allocated,' he expressed his view.
The law doesn't recognize stewards.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward's role  no law deals with the regulation of this role".
However, no regulations prohibit the carrier from providing the services.
The road traffic law only recognises the term accompanying the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined,' adds Hanzelka.
The Director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law is adequate to deal with this problem.
It depends if the bus has approved standing seats.
That's it", he says.
It categorises buses into urban with standing seats and maximum speed limit, intercity with standing seats with maximum speed higher and long-distance without standing seats with maximum speed allowed and seats with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet flight there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on airplanes.
It's not safe there either when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can bang his head".
"If the bus brakes abruptly, the laws of physics obviously apply.
Just like on the city bus or the tram.
The transport company must resolve the safety of the stewards by an internal regulation", he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transportation company that offers steward services.
This one takes about two hundred.
The director still considers their work dangerous after the accident.
"As soon as I feel I must consider the steward profession a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce expenses", he says.
Asiana's director Alexej Litvin, who runs a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, justified the absence of stewards on his vehicles as an interest in safety.
"We don't have a hostess, we've been fighting it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
A great tragedy has occurred.
A young hostess from the Plzeň region who had worked for the company for two years died in the accident on the Naples route.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the bus's path.
The bus driver tried to avoid him with a sudden maneuver, but he hit him with the front right.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the stewarts' resting place were occupied.
"You can't book these seats on long-distance buses, they're unbelievable".
The company is planning to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court's ruling to pay damages to the girl's family, but it expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
The revision of the law?
Out of sight
The revision of the law, which has been worked on by a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport for more than a year, could lead to clarifying the movement of stewarts on board buses.
"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They don't think so much of buses, they're more concerned with the scoring system, maximum speed on the motorway and mobile phone use while driving,' says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the stewarts' activity as a major threat to passenger safety", spokesman Havelka concludes, saying that the police and security offices are responsible for controlling bus safety.
The hopes of Düsseldorf are in Frankfurt
There is no lack of words in the letter from the director of WestLB to the employees of the company.
In the letter published on Monday, it was suggested that "the capital market centre of the savings bank financial group" could be formed through the merger of the Düsseldorf banking institution's units with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank.
West LB would launch a 'competent block' with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive impetus for further links in the banking sector of the Länder.
That is how it is read when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate its capacity for action.
Because the distressed WestLB is still under a lot of pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, which has long ago pointed out to the North Rhine-Westphalian regional government that time is running out to find a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the customers of the Savings Banks themselves, because of their investment funds, already know, and WestLB have certainly been talked about for some time, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, Deka-Bank's head Franz Waas, presenting the first half-year turnover, said that a merger of the house on Via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB made no sense.
However, the Deka board, which is half-run by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated to the board to conduct talks with West LB on joint procurement.
It could be market trading or parts of it.
But the talks have, as they say in the business world, just begun.
Della-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important banks in Frankfurt. It is not the first time that it has been mentioned when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, for a short period, it appeared that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This three-way association was not made.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Hesse was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The other two institutions were also unable to reach agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they've often thought about merging Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba's board of directors, spoke out against games of design to reunite with his house.
Apart from that, it seems that knowledge is being created, that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
Since the Bavarian parliamentary election has been held, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank and the Landesbank of Baden-Württemberg may take place first.
For Helaba, that's not good news at all.
If the pressure increases for more mergers, there will be a shortage of partners.
The Southern would now have the junior partner, although so far it has weathered the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Türingen savings bank association, which holds 85% of Helaba, has decided on the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasoning are just a calculation.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are matched.
In June Merl pointed out that the German savings bank association had not yet given an answer to the crucial question as to the business model by which the future of regional banks would be secured.
The West LB division could also come out eventually, which is of course not desirable on the part of the West LB.
The letter from the management board thus expresses the desire to seek a 'general solution' in any event.
It will be seen how the merger of the individual parties with Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time, for Luca it's the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser 5l barrel, stands a massive bearded man, showing the 200 or so travelers the deep tones he can produce from his throat.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus station next to the station of Porta Nuova, depart this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra", arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another only Brazilian travelers.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's not a thing for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with wide silver stripes belongs to him.
They've been to Oktoberfest for five years. This year they're on three tours.
Night trip, day trip to the party, 10:30 back.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The 45 Euro cost includes the trip, the welcome toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian authenticity standards, the sickness fund and the German guide. Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly, the bus is silent, the passengers are asleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian-marked buses on the A9 motorway before Munich make a short stop.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, as scheduled, there are already some 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left side of it is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When they open the doors of the beer tent, it means running!" quotes Marco from the early morning.
"Run!" Run and take your seats at the back of the tent.
"Not in front, or we block, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, divide in the adjacent space!"
The bowl costs 8.25 euros, Marco shouts.
And don't forget to tip the guy.
"Show the security service that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third, "Tonight at exactly 10:30 p.m. we meet again here, understand?"
We're already leaving for the party.
On the road, you can follow the yellow hats and attach them to trees, road signs, and even a billboard of a major Bavarian people's party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the holiday, known as "Italian Weekend".
Exact figures are not available, there are 50,000 who are leaving to cross the Alps and invade the tents, and it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced with 7 officers from the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical care ahead of the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
The most beloved of all by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed last week by Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück.
It is good that the politician used the word 'relative' and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, which is listed on the DAX, obtains a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that the support credits would amount to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part you asked for.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
The State lender, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced itself in a very short time  which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had fallen by 95% to EUR 2,37 million, and its equity ratio had fallen from EUR 1,6 to EUR 1,45.
Current income and net income from financial operations were down to zero compared with last year, while earnings from increases in both applications and certain actions and from the liquidation of loan provisions were down by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only higher revenues from the reimbursement of subordinated compensation costs from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest under the single tax code and business management for business consortia made the negative profit rather moderate at around 16%.
The former public lender, after being privatised in 1990, had become involved in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were spun off into Aareal Bank.
Since the income from traditional state financing was too low, Depfa has increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private-public-investor projects (PPP) and has diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to depreciate the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007, they had already been reduced by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is an important state and infrastructure lender after the absorption of Depfa.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks than other institutions, because it does not have customer deposits.
The collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago has largely dried up lending between banks, because banks are accumulating liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs some 50 billion in short-term refinancing for part of the DEFFA loan portfolio each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate's opinion, the group's financial needs were covered by credit for a certain period and the company was protected from the influence of mostly non-functioning international money markets.
Other sources say that the money will ensure the refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE's chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group would not need money markets anytime soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) rely on the fact that the HRE group's marketable position is still assured.
That is what we hope for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and the weightlessness of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The financing may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also possible.
After the bank learned on Sunday night that it was going to fail, the temporary bailout failed to calm the mood.
The share price falls by 75% to 3.30 Euro.
They're pretty good at holding mortgage rates.
While the earlier-tier debts are almost immovable, the deferred loans are falling.
The loans of the Württemberg-Hypo subsidiary are particularly affected, and understandably the accruals with maturity beyond 2009.
The HRE loans were previously seen as a speculative alternative investment, but now their value must, after the intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which was hit by the DEFFA, be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until the central banks, governments and the banks that are less affected are still ready, you can count on a repayment of annuities by the deadline.
Or it comes into play, which no one dares to hope  that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But when you look at the information that's been distorted by partial statistical data, the near-certainty has become a justified hope.
It will mainly create sleepless nights for long-term investors with the decision whether to split their commitments.
Short-term investors may terminate the carryover of losses for future payments of the capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, was to appear at Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls began to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Log of Japan's exchange stories.
First Day of School in Japan
I was so excited.
I was also very fond of going to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way myself, and luckily I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the first hour of class does not seem to have been fixed as we did in Lower Saxony.
The students come in gradually from 8 a.m. onward, until a brief interview with the teacher, the so-called "home room", begins at 8:40.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, and I'm in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I did not yet have my school uniform, I put on an old host mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks, and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat down in front of the chair and tried to pronounce it correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana"... My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and I'm celebrating my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language two years earlier.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled, and gestured, and I kept hearing the word "Kawaii".
I knew this one from my Mangas.
It's part of the Japanese girls' survival dictionary and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me laughed, she was honored to sit next to an exchange student.
The rest of the class went on quietly, but when the gong rang, I was literally assaulted.
They were all talking in disorder and grinning and asking me questions. It is really hard to understand Japanese English.
Everyone opened their Bento during the break.
My host mother even made me a lunch basket-- it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had a risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of meat and tofu roll.
To tell you the truth, I don't even know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a whole new flavor.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Except maybe the plums with salt, brrr!
Bento is not just the Japanese school lunch.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a homemade Bento, quite artistically prepared, in the hope of later getting to know the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my manga.
I'm just curious if you can find out.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
Finally, I have been reading the Manga with great enthusiasm for years.
And to better understand comics and the culture they contain, I started learning a little bit of Japanese.
I was totally convinced I'd come once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs, and customs.
They care about us a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends, and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is so well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life".
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flee when they feel danger.
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: Many animals have feelings too.
4. But how could it be that when they behave in our way, they have the same feelings as we do?
The Internet newspaper "Edge" has been publishing articles by well-known scientists for some years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question: "What do you believe to be true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, which I or anyone else has so far been able to prove, since we cannot even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case, we have to at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter unworkable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do: it pretends to be dead, it flees, or it attacks.
People behave in a similar way, which is why some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I can't believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often linked to human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short-term memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and seems to be completely lacking among other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, we thus admit the basis on the premise that humans differ even from other primates.
Another dramatic feature should be seen in the way man speaks: Since much of life is connected with language, it is often said to be connected with conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal's consciousness, as it is made, is certainly very different from the circumstances of our consciousness.
So it's hard to figure out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will present us with great problems.
Most interpretations relate to the content of conscious experience, but apart from that there is another aspect of consciousness that science would find easier to access.
You could analyze the processes of the consciousness of animals without regard to their contents, and that's exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we go first to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What, then, is the outline of feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or of its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
Thus, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates, and especially humans.
With the speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because we with the help of words and grammar can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In this respect Antonio Damasio for example believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the paleocephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could definitely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
I cannot deny this on a purely theoretical level, but I find it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear is likely to be felt by the senses in both cases: but how could this be true if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in similar ways?
A cockroach in danger runs away as if he too feels fear?
In my view, mere similarity of behaviour cannot yet demonstrate any vital similarity.
And that's why neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleo-brains, cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the paleo-brain responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it in humans, how would you prove it in rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?) have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
However, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that you do not do the same procedure in rats and humans.
Just as I don't do research on language and consciousness in rats, I don't do research on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This may sound shortsighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly bump into a wall.
I'm a practical emotional at heart.
UEFA President Platini: postponed to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
'The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the Europeans with Poland,' said Wasjunik.
"This is not, however, an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both host countries are limping on the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of stadiums for the European Championships may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at full speed", said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will be watching us constantly"
A more radical step was taken in Poland.
After several scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer".
Many players in the top flight last season alone were convicted of manipulation, and the start of the league was postponed until the last minute.
Dennis Quaid is outraged
She wanted to promote a new movie, she talked about privacy in an interview, and now she's got a beef with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her ex Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He foams with rage and retorts.
War of the Roses: a delayed outbreak for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting each other in a bitter public dispute.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful".
The extent of the betrayals she would only know after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul strip" was working with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women"  tells the story of an adulterous man.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear-cut: It would be "unheard of", the 54-year-old told the "New York Daily News", that "Meg is once again repeating and reworking the story of our relationship".
It would also be "deplorable" for Jack, their 16-year-old son, to again "be publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that separation means for every child".
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is remarried and will soon be the father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family where everything is going well".
Air and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, a recent study suggests that flights are up to 50% cheaper than other forms of transport.
Flights and hotel stays have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a marked decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities examined are still rising on average by around 6.9 compared with 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would be in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar as the reason, which would have led to a "strong desire to travel among American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be hit by the hotel price recession more strongly than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3%, even topping the European record
The trend in the first quarter was also upward in the price of flights:
Due to the increase in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay on average 7,1% more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would be up to 29,2% more expensive
From April to June, economy class airfares fell by an average of 12.5% compared with the previous quarter, but price changes in first and business class were much weaker.
In Germany prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9%, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
The study even found that prices for domestic flights in Germany were cut in half.
The reason for the price collapse is, on the one hand, the downward trend in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, would increase the pressure on competition.
The closure of non-profitable routes at Airlines would be a sign of the critical situation, as would the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008  24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach by 1-0.
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes the champion.
At Borussia Luhukay, he still can't find a working group of 11.
Here Kristoffer Klein is making the lucky landing worse for national team player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came in late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated precisely, it passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal", Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the hallway of the Hamburg arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over, and most were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for HSV for almost three decades, enjoying even greater esteem from some of the old players.
And so his warning found an answer even in the high places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
"Not everything was pretty here today", Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted to be more relaxed".
For the 1-0 Hamburg must thank the head-butt by Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty win", summed up Martin Jol.
The SV in Hamburg will be 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue skies in the arena and the flashing score on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as before the class.
It's a birthday without a real party.
"we can fix everything", said Marcell Jansen.
He feels that the provisional certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the league than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves und Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen - is slowly finding itself, but it has not yet managed to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more dribbling", Jol rebounds.
After the defeat of the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
The initial news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to temporarily crash by 700 points.
This was the biggest one-day point loss in its history.
Later, Down recovered a little.
At around 8:30 p.m. the world's most important stock market barometer reported a 5% shortfall on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was flat with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest losers at that time were Dow American Express, which gave us back just 14%, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it .
The shares of Goldman Sachs have fallen by just 10%.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had joined the venture.
The rescue plan was to provide financial resources for the seizure of the so-called mortgage documents
The sum must, however, be paid not in one fell swoop, but in stages.
As a result, the State had to keep the financial companies' Aktienoptionsscheine, which could be redeemed with an adequate trend in the quotations, in order to reduce the charge to the State coffers.
The course of the downward spiral in Europe and the USA
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not remove the doubts of investors.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is plummeting, tearing the German stock market index downward
The Dow Jones is pulling us back despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the government.
The spectacular fall in the price of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank has pushed the German stock market index into deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender have temporarily lost 3 quarters of their value, despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks. Commercial Bank has sold more than 20%.
The German DAX index has slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is trading at a deficit of 3.7% of 5.839 points.
The world's stock markets are on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion bailout might not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow fell 334 points in the first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25 points.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1st.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: in London the FTSE index fell by 3.2% for the time being, and the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark after initial profits was 1.26% short on 11.743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index has slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex index fell 506.43 points or 3.9%, and closed with 12,595.75 payers.
In the MDax, they sell Arcandor's shares after the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has signed new shares for 23 million .
The Business and Tourism Group also stated that the Thomas Cook holdings will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled scientists: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, death by freezing now hangs over her.
Scientists have been raving about a mysterious phenomenon for years. The Swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical device as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has puzzled scholars for years is that rockets do not behave quite as one would expect under the law of gravity.
In fact, it leads to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly get faster or slower.
Physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter as a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and he tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"The cause of the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth", he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
Evidently, a force of attraction is emanating from it, and its effect on other heavenly bodies is evident.
It is, however, completely invisible, that is, it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the mass of the entire cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout before the liberation, six kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the report of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are examining their health", said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian woman as well as their eight Egyptian companions are reported to be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released is still unclear: the kidnappers, according to an Egyptian public security officer, were ready for the conclusion of the abduction, before the Sudanese army killed six of them by surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom", the official said.
It would have been "just a matter of handing over the hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot dead six of the kidnappers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany, which was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
Stepfather's Abuse "Leaded to Suicide"
Years of abuse by stepfather led to a woman's suicide, a court has ruled.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for six years after admitting eight counts of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court heard that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle, when she was between the ages of five and seven.
In a note of confession, Trerise wrote: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court has learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise molested her and bandaged her before having sex while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent much time as a volunteer with the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her.
In 2006, the Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends of Miss Randle, who had been a brilliant surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "left with her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his Plymouth apartment.
She's thought to have suffocated herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended, "I bound and gagged her".
"I did not molest her.
I feel responsible for his death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up in court".
I notice the effects Stephanie's father and mother describe as having had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman".
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June is to be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was on a transfer from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the least delicate of the charges made under this law, and there's nothing to suggest criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They must have thought this was being handled internally at the Mod and Cabinet Office", he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is about to be charged under Section 8.1 of the act, the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents that were lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the bill of B&B
UK construction companies could face a bill of over £80,000 after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has given £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was "irritating" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The £14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions which have behaved prudently are now being called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions which have been far less prudent.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among themselves had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the Association of Building Companies, told the BBC he believes it is unfair.
"It is irritating that those institutions which have behaved prudently in the housing market are now being called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions which have been much less prudent".
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the recording began in 1945.
"We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options are in place to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant bill", Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest due for a whole year could be almost double that.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations with no shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk is 5p a liter.
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be a wholesale price increase on its milk for an extra five pence a litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and it comes after a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for bail from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was a member of parliament
The case is one of many corruption charges against you.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but her party, Awami League, has demanded that the military-backed interim government of the country give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on parole, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he's going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the high court order.
"The High Court rejected the request for bail for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have bail as she is already abroad on medical parole", says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the High Court order".
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan polio campaigns
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign because of Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said this was despite Taliban promises that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously held that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's chief executive, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the US Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the Justice Department's Inspector General criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fears that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or investigated", said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the fired lawyers had not been rated worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the firing was politically motivated.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in prosecuting high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the firing storm, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The inspector general's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had primary responsibility for the firings, that he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including former Bush senior aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will be accepting his special gold award at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to win the recognition.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of the 1977 hit album by Meat Loaf.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the shortlist in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of them".
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocal that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for almost nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an operation for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Turned out later he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossroads, some famous, others merely for use.
But even many veteran and long-time taxi drivers find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street without making Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active traffic lane.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see on a normal atlas.
The street must have admirers, though.
For example, there's Avalon Bay, the real estate company for the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for the shops and boutiques that are supposed to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were struck by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the gentry quarter of the past.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Development, which controls the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Township Board's Land Use Committee some representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the board prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
"There is very little space left to the city's property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place", he said.
"There might be proposals to set it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access".
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it would reopen the small road and install seating, including some for a café to which the real estate company hopes to lease the space.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was first made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity", he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Don Sethlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock landmark that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The terrain was beautiful", said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes".
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about the "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity  a fragment of a city almost unchanged that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Slightly Nostalgic Look at the City in Destruction"), published a portion of a Speech on the History of the City that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
Author Brendan Gill wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead-end alley, dark even by day and bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and Saracen windows, with week-old newspapers hovering in the basement".
With few exceptions, the street looked almost the same as on a recent evening.
A rat was running agilely across the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay next to a bunch of fresh abandoned newspapers.
A few bystanders said they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested it might need a little embellishment.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thought some people underestimated the attractiveness of the road in its present state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "were in black, filthy, disgusting places".
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow at California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School".
Getting Hispanic voters to actually vote is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, "African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students, "which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's education plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English learners.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in classrooms of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The school's students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth graders, a staggering 100 percent of the students took the top-level test in the 2008 maths state exam.
An equally astonishing 93 percent of fourth graders took the English Language Arts Expert Level Test.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama's favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of "no excuses".
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full immersion".
The use of English emphasises the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had entered the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't have been able to identify who it was".
"It works", he observed, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other predominantly Hispanic schools with English-language students?
The school's achievements make the answer to that question very easy, but the education policy in his own party (the National Education Associations is a long-time advocate of bilingual education) and his own continued support for bilingual education make it impossible to predict Mr. Obama's answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than dismiss or trivialize them.
Oil plunges and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that even the U.S. financial-market bailout may fail to lift the economy.
Crude futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York stock exchange in morning trading.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street, and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plunged to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety hit investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached a deal over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest installment of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic weekend negotiations that led to a bailout deal "seemed to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm.
"The outlook for global equities, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain", analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw materials perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China".
Bank analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter is a team record.
After spending more time than anyone else in the Jets uniform for the past eight and more seasons, defensive back Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a comeback.
"Never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had equaled the gray of the menacing clouds overhead with a feeble game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing synchronization took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left in the first half.
"I didn't go out of my way", said Favre of all the passages that came to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people may think".
As Favre and Coles played catch, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a running play and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Eric Smith's security team predicted another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens is forcing a fumble from Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to give them a 34-0 lead.
That's more than the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the insanity, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When told both - the Jets gave up 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third".
There were a lot of points in a short time".
Gebrselassie rested and beat his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the favourably flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shatters his previous score of 2:03:26 set last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record in a career so stunning that it has produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympics marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As long-distance runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone the distance, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade since Ronaldo of Costa do Brasil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest has left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy", Gebrselassie told reporters, "I'm not going to be able to do it".
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end it all worked out".
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying on the runway as if it were a half-long race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace accelerated by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie after the opening laps were wiped out.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a steep final to part with Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games in what is described as a bad accident, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the math, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start at a great distance, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and trials of a black life
Hidden in the sprawling theme park in the suburbs of Orlando, just a few miles from the glitter, the noise, the enormity, lies the quiet city where the pride and the complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all-black incorporated city in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prison".
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city he described - and which makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that "knowing so little about us, he does not know what he is missing".
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called in for a keynote address on race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.
"We are very careful about how our story is told", said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city's oldest church.
"It must be right".
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It's both a historic model of black power grab and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It's a literary center but also an example of the oak shade of rural Southern black culture - sometimes scorned, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through candid, dialect-rich books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a setting of black history and human drama.
Low as a bucket in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then veered off into more private areas.
"Off the street to the left", he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always tended, thinking he could scarcely read and write".
She also mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that fits the passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
Clearly this wasn't Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone liked.
"Zora told it like it was", said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girlfriends whom Hurston immortalized by quoting men who sing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it".
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her relocated family to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston drove into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts decent clothing.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others grinned.
"People were always very glad to see Zora", said Mr. Franklin.
But, she added, rocking in her chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremonies, and no big conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a 2003 biography of Hurston.
A change occurred in the 1980's.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 through the city's western border.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration had, among other things, brought an end to the community's idyllic isolation.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hate to the community's doorstep.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on one side", says Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who got killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon out of a car".
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston petitioned the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, while positive in some respects, is diluting Eatonville's cohesion and jeopardizing the confidence of its youth.
"Black kids used to be hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening", said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't hug your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural divide there", said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and made room for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as she did, with cheerful self-assurance and lines like, "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand it".
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit the bookshelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had re-turned the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state backed down from its road project.
"The five lanes of the revived highway, brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city", Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project helped change the image the city has of itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents started reevaluating the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new one-story bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repainted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can feel like a side street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to search for the history of Eatonville, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
Prior permission is required for most interviews, and some things - like the murals on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher with a soft spot for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as Hurston Festival expanded, a high level of civic pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, neither better nor worse and proud, creative, hardworking, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is genuine civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police department, who he said might need help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they just came in here, will think, 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,'" said Alondra Kenon after the Mass on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the history, it's a really nice city".
Here in New York we all speak fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, the beehives overhead the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City are having their worst day at the office every day since the crash of 1929.
Mailmen shake metal tea carts across the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 broken stretched shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees still wait in line for their morning bagels at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to catch a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a workday.
It didn't seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the event to coincide with my late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a line of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cash register, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions to the Macy's department store, and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "trusted banker", were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, however, they've already taken their savings from smaller banks from places they commute from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrift (sort of like a construction company), credit unions and kind of citizen savings banks whose branches only operate within a state, and they say they treat customers like family members.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was placed under a management buy-out, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to bail it out.
The employees and the contractors standing in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for the most bail-outs on Wall Street.
The average New Yorker has become a financial expert in the last few weeks.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in a familiar way, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, almost 50-year-old janitor at my condo, changed the subject from our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I'm not taking any chances".
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "City against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like those street signs representing mosques with a red line running through them.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties won big in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if the incident is election related.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, has embarked on a spiritual journey following its rightward turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with strong anti-immigration bills and some of their slogans have been described by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, has campaigned against veils and burkas and has also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, citing them as political symbols of the continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the strongest political bloc in the nation, indicated that the change was driven predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel banned for Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities who monitored him that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent police last Thursday after they provided the magistrates with proof of Glitter's previous arrests for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford Prosecution in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Precinct, Kent Police filed a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's overseas travel to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person".
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days' notice of his intended departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities can lead to a five-year prison sentence.
Kent P.D. said they don't want to discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible movements around the country.
A Kent Police spokesman said: "Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone staying in the UK because we have the right comprehensive systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent residents is Kent Police's top concern and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimise any potential risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities wouldn't let him go through passport control and he ended up on a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and he returned to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge Prosecutor's Office, west of London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to register him for sex offenders.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing child abuse images.
A source at the Home Office said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels or flyers or old clothes.
Just the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the performance, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On one side is the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two faces inseparable, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they don't have to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photography Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, which is growing every day", explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be about ordinary people, but by looking at the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These "on the street" people are "artists who can convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these great men, you don't have to portray them on stage.
Because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with my camera the personalities of the great flamenco artists".
With his passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
These are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, resemble classic photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day".
Not the dancing, the singing, the playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, his ability to win over the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are featured in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTproject".
Although the concept is different in "Flamenco-People", the photographer admits, "I love to portray people, to get to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their life, whether that moment is long or short.
I think portraiture is the hardest genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you sometimes don't even know or who give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true".
The collection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled "Flamenco-people", is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 of Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "chance"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
The writer, who has always been a favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is working on today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it".
"If I had good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible", he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of Aquedotto.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize for being the most voted writer by the participants  an old edition of Dickens' book "Our mutual friend", filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public to whom time flew when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "of living beyond what I lived"; how he writes in a "disciplined way" to compensate for the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous re-making; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and how "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories rest.
The Spanish-American novelist, recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", Vargas Llosa stressed, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people more anticonformist". For this he invited writers to "not give in to frivolity" and to "assume responsibility" for their vocation.
The weather is hindering the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the rides
The bullfighting celebration that was supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has been bad for this festival, preventing it from being held two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight.
The card included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
This time it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being taken out in triumph, after having bullfighted with taste and aesthetics.
That afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two runs, receiving a salute and an ear, granted more by the public than by the race itself.
The worst of them all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous muzzle, he earned the whistles of much of the public.
A van with 2,000 kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint in Alava
Five to ten in the morning.
The officers intimate the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping, flee.
Officers alerted the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, fled.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After pursuing them, the officers manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement of the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The individual arrested is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some road officials in Alava were conducting a traffic check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, in defiance of orders, accelerated abruptly and passed the checkpoint.
Officers pursued the vehicle until, after a couple of miles, it stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The agents of the Earthquake Agency were able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note of it when they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish buns, which were found in the back of the vehicle, were later taken into police custody for further investigation and weight-taking.
Furthermore, since the officers found that the license plate was "duplicated" because it did not match the one shown in the van's documentation, the arrested man was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
Detainee A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police station for due process and will be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her performing risky maneuvers as she tried to drive her car out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol who told People magazine.
The witness specified that at about 4:30 p.m. the Locklear "was slamming the accelerator, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with sudden back and forth maneuvers.
Shortly after, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first glance, saw Locklear pull over to a nearby road and exit the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused", and so the officers took her to a drug and alcohol treatment center for testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the alcohol overdose hypothesis was dismissed from the start, although "according to what was observed by officers at the outset, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some drug".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was booked into the local jail around 7 p.m., only to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was released from a rehabilitation facility in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the UI to take responsibility in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former youth and sports advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities", Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been until now an adviser in the Sicilian council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations into alleged irregularities committed by Silva. "The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be as transparent as possible".
He also stressed that training is governed by "very strict codes of ethics for all public offices".
"Sangre de mayo", the epic wager of Garci
Inspired by Episodios Nacionales by Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros budget.
With this film, the director has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, which runs for more than two and a half hours, debuts in cinemas this Friday, and will become a four-hour television miniseries on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims that he has realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Community of Madrid three years before filming a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd.
The 15 million budget allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a 'unique opportunity' to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a 'stunned Spain that made a mistake in choosing the leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge backlog in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII', Garci noted.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the scenography that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often rehearses before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating", considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works".
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, rehearse in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos -, represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "which should be known".
This Garci movie doesn't expect awards.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize you're only working for prosperity, and at some point you just settle for making one more film", explains Garci after more than 30 years in the business.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sicilian essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sicilian dancer pays tribute to another dancer from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a freestyle dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of women's emancipation, the likes of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and she advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two world wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have loved to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character.
She says: "We don't want to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangis.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my own dance also fits into this aesthetic", she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with her who had been a student.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he has agreed to work on my work, and I am very honored".
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi by Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola by Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been all-round divas, and who have always had many fans".
The work also includes some form of the life of this woman, which takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all over Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of the women who had a huge impact in a given historical period and now nobody remembers her, much less considers her work as something of value", says Bayon.
The show will start today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also marks the end of the Triennium.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Cultural Advisory Board of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Triennio de Zenobia y Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Trennio de Zenobia y Juan Ramon" concludes with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House-Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Cultural Advisory Board of the Government of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America is a little less fun without Paul Newman.
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
The line is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia de malicia", and it gives an idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of America as a whole, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
And yet it cost him a lot to get an Oscar.
And since 2007 he's been retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend", lamented Robert Redford, "my life and my country may have been better because of his existence".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
He died a father of cinema and the country at a particularly dark time, fear of terrorists and markets, self-esteem by the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivation to feel worthy.
When times are so hard, men so virtueless and still people to admire, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, she embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn who died of an overdose to the creation of the brand of homemade and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has had a hard time moving beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, caring neither for nationality nor passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that it is not a man who has died, it is an era that has passed.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left a very high standard of example for all of us", says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping the need for integrity and a serious private life away from the cameras in high regard.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try, and Paul Newman is a good example of this.
He was divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful though he certainly did not miss the opportunities to be otherwise.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today when I have a steak in the house?" he would joke.
In heaven he is proud that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, none was so proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a passionate philanthropist", they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid, and after the failed attempt in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect run", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if it were taken into account later in the evaluation and I had to look at it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the backpack being removed, which meant you had to go first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, it's to take everything back (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you didn't.
You had to go just to get the backpack (first silly, go just for that) and (after the related tail), surprise! they only had size 'S' shirts (second silly, because I need a size XL).
What world are we living in?
Is it the crisis that has made them decide to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, things like that are trivial compared to the day of the race itself.
Besides having to go very early to get the chip, the queue was 15 minutes long, and, moreover, you had to drop off your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race with more than 11,000 people expected.
So, as you might expect, the race started before we even put the backpack down, although once we did, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the more than 40-minute wait, which was followed by attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
At least 500 people tomorrow will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, won't even show up in the rankings in the correct order because of the chip that, I guess, didn't record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if I'm asked about the perfect race, this one won't come into my mind.
So I think we'll continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but not much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) by assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this receptionist is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
You can also group the attendees into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group with which he is talking and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be available shortly.
All without the blue screen.
That's very impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial junk, they would go five times faster.
A discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extras".
The change in direction is noticeable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the web, I was one of the people who supported the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but perhaps we need to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week confirms that.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You just take your computer and you run Explorer or Firefox or Chrome  and we spend more time every day browsing the web than we do in a remote, window-based environment.
What are half the applications in the operating system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to provide a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I'll give you a small example.
I took the photo in this post at one of the Microsoft employee recreation centers in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine, a sign urges them to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, moreover, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be launched in the first months of 2009, but probably by the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is punishing.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the Costa Azul, Leonardo da Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather', as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can evoke the image of the sharp-moustached forger lifting weights in the walking circus.
It is basically the typical men's shirt, with a cotton inside, with a zipper and no sleeves.
It's the 'tank', as the English speakers call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels from the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive emblem and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt wear as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels from the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive emblem and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company's production is not just about the famous tanks.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxer shorts, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Underwear designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't bother me".
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they're so much more than pretty girls and celebrities who lend their name.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm did of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Hot and shy, she'll get you fast.
Tell us about your time in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine's Day.
Let's say, a very busy day, but at the same time, exciting.
What elements are used in your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
My sister and I both like movies from the '50s and '60s, and we draw inspiration from that.
Then I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, it all comes together and there are many elements in common.
I loved clothes from an early age; I longed to go to my grandmother's house and look through my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, as a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to my dress.
You know, dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to the rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when you're handed the wardrobe, that's when you really meet the character.
So, it all goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and the professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
But no, I didn't.
I've never felt better. I like the idea of 30.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl, and that's given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about becoming a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my own body asks me to be one, and I want to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not too worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for the release of a few films from last year.
That's right, and I really want them out.
Being a woman from the theatre, I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything to be clear and quick, but it can't always be that way.
I want "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ" out.
Let 's see if you like them .
A few days ago, you debuted on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization "Women for a Better World", and the clothes that we exhibited -- I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango -- were auctioned to raise funds for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
There are so many things being said about her that I, who have known her for a long time, can tell you that they are not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part where you're involved.
He asked me to march for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it's to help women in the Third World, you can't back down.
Recurrent alcoholic drivers will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol levels to install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in a state of drunkenness or if you do not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Prosecutor's Office, which says it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The aim of this project is to reintegrate the driver, who will have to undergo a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of those who are reported to have drunk driven more than once then drive again.
The alcohol lock would avoid this, because it is a system attached to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than is permitted.
The cost is over 1000 euros and would be borne by the offender.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with such devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain, it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb such behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its development, since legal reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, and, no doubt, the reform necessary for criminal procedure would require an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and no peep-toes.
On British time, at 5:40 p.m., according to the schedule, the Spanish plane carrying the Princes of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced me to use my hand as a visor to watch the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the way, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time...
No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the Asturian princes are and the importance of the journey.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and the military cord of 27 Marines offering the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, is wind-blown, very sober, not using her usual "peep-toes", perhaps told that bad weather was looming in Mexico City.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief pause before passing into the room where the official party awaits them.
At the door of their hotel, one of the four largest in the city, a cheerful Mexican television reporter waits.
The top prize in fashion
There is probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no designer more exquisite and good-natured than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field.
He offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her drawings in the Mango shop window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
It is also the company's second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square metres.
The first is in London.
The many events, coupled with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the competition jury, began with a lavish dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal's finest canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born with a broken heart and doing virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some breath-taking accessories of ELAH and on the arm of his son Luis - a young man of almost two meters in height - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the honours of the house and as a knight as it is he ended up, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the store in pants and a shirt  drawn by her own hand  transformed herself for dinner, wearing a long black dress very sensual and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for the ballet essays and she, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "grand plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the palace premises, but she had shown us pictures of her son on her mobile phone.
The next day we were delighted by the presence of Olivier Martinez - another young man riding his motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having made sure beforehand that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's the way.
1001, the stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that weren't enough, they're all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7:00 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the hectic pace of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty of disengaging from the world of work.
No, this number is nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage, or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book a whole "menu" of options tailored to each person's taste and time.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 Ways to Relax", and its calm will hit bookstores thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is not possible to gain calmness in such areas as work or personal relationships, this "handbook" refutes that belief.
He also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is not already flowing through your veins to restore balance to your body and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but those babies who talk while they're asleep.
The first time it happens, you're scared at best, but it doesn't really matter.
It's a benign alteration of sleep called somnolence.
It occurs with some frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely most of you have been told that you talked in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes these episodes are linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting, or sleepwalking, but not necessarily.
As mentioned earlier, it may be associated with stages of very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
However, it is still a phenomenon that has been little studied.
The intensity of its appearance is also extremely variable.
It may be that the person speaks in a very calm tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or the opposite may occur (crying, shouting, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be wise to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to see if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stressful situation).
What you can do, however, is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to over-excite the baby before he goes to bed.
Suggest calm games and avoid TV shows or programs that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children who find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain a measure of inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more comfortably.
Once the sleepwalkers appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Helpful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not aware of what's going on, and you'd interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember, if the child seems very anxious and the episodes are frequent, it is best to consult a doctor or to find out what is causing such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common situation), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You'll get nothing, because he's asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you can hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming about saying, so you need to be very careful about interpreting the information and the conclusions it might lead to.
Never tell the child that you may ask questions at night to learn his secrets.
Not for fun.
Something like that causes a tremendous amount of distress.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found its way to victory at home after a long period of unsuccess.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-blacks created the most chances by turning one of them into the game winner.
The pace was not very steady during this match in which the strikers struggled to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who approached the seventh with a shot from a distance, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirn high, Romain of the tip and still Diebold.
The Danemarie responded with a block in midfield, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in charge.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed by Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after the first net of Marais for the well-positioned Illhaeusern, he took back a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the gunner of the Illhaeusern will not enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But the damage will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause problems for the Illhaeusern Eleven, who have retreated just to "strengthen" the defence, except in the very last minutes of the game when, after a rocambolesque action, the ball touched the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will be visiting Britain.
In the face of the demonstration by the fishermen who on Monday brutally blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning to impress the representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "present himself with concrete proposals".
The President's visit coincides with the general meeting of the 'crisis committee', set up by the Breton fishermen to take measures to cope with the rise in the price of diesel, which has reached its record high with an average of more than 1,14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the President "will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the working conditions and pay of the seamen".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "slim operation" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as they marched in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to ports on the Atlantic and English Channel coasts, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where fishing boats have been at the wharf, or to Havre, where some 20 boats have prevented the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and del Croisic, on the Atlantic Loire, broke off the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the crisis committee will decide on Tuesday on the movement's future actions and on whether it will participate in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the move.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they have no intention of moving to Paris", announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is only reached with less than EUR 0.30 per litre of diesel.
Paul Newman the magnificent
The unforgettable "Butch Cassidy" performer died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes have hailed the film legend and busy actor Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts for 2008
The aircraft manufacturer is expecting 215 deliveries this year, despite the threat of recession weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest airline, has maintained its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft, its chairman Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first six months, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company has a strong reliance on the Chinese market, particularly for the 30 to 120 seat range.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers over eight years.
AIG to divest more than 15% of its business
The American International Group, an insurance company rebuilt by the U.S. monetary authorities, would sell more than 15 percent of its assets to repay an $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider the sale of a large part of its business, as well as the divestment of its life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said, citing more than authoritative sources.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss the possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets which AIG intends to divest include the aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these divestments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly raise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of having 80% of its capital seized by the US authorities.
Paris: history of the morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic collapse on Monday after the House of Representatives voted against Paulson's plan to bail out financial institutions: The Dow Jones dropped 6.98%, a record drop, to near 800 points, and the Nasdaq dropped 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst losses in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day the stock markets reopened following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of the main technology stocks, lost 199,61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index lost 8,81% (or 106,85 points) to close at 1,106,55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralised at first, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the banks' bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this shows how much the market was counting on the project", he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were indeed dying ... then the witness would be quickly passed on to the Fed  Federal Reserve and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And, again highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities have arranged for the purchase of Wachovia's banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for urgent intervention by banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not just facing an American crisis, but a global one", added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bills fell to 3,632%, down from 3,827% on Friday night, while the 30-year yield was 4,161%, down from 4,357% the day before.
Obama in the lead in the first televised duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House, here's a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed victory in the televised duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, while worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to halt the decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has got the upper hand.
A snap poll conducted by CBS News on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them think Obama will win, while 25% are betting on McCain.
A strong performance by his list mate Joe Biden, expected in the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good intuition", warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped touting his unquestionable foreign policy expertise, pointing to the "naivety" of his opponent on the issues he discussed during the first face-to-face meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that"... he has said repeatedly.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills to be president", he assured.
Which has been a constant target of the Republican TV campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without delay, he proved to be concise and precise.
It promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain never understood, unlike Obama", he retorted this weekend in a Democratic commercial, rebuking the Republican for failing to take the necessary steps to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina in the pouring rain for a rally.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in Obama's favor, who is seen by Americans as the most capable person to save the economy from the brink.
'Next week could be a turning point,' said the influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's insight into economic matters to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reiterating his intention to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the whispers from Wall Street, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates have cautiously dodged questions centered on the $700 billion ($470 billion) bailout plan passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to challenge the early results of the legislative elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening just after the polls closed in the central square of Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some people admit that they didn't even vote :" What for? They'll do whatever they want with my vote", says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression on foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic turnaround.
Sanctions, including a visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and an asset freeze, could be lifted if the election is considered legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were removed from the election commissions and our observers could not participate in the vote-rigging", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of face", says Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it's who counts the cards that matters, and in this case it's the executive.
If opposition MPs enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve television space, regional meetings and legislative proposals".
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game, as 'dialogue with the European Union is needed.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
We want to be independent now".
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election process, will recognise the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the turnout seems too high and that the widespread early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you not notice that there was an election?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one at the polls.
And there will be no more than five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient to power".
The night's silence falls on the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are rejoicing in their success.
The Meeting - Blood Is Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained the public's trust, which had been shaken by the blood-infected scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood supply run by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service was infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and public protests, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994 under the direction of Justice Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent a recurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delayed in drafting a report, some provinces set up a committee with the goal of devising a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec for the supply of Quebec and Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its operations, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the Quebec donation system, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Through continuous efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the years, we have regained the public's trust", she explains, before proudly stating that by early 2008, about 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the woman who has been chairman of the Commission since 1998, the year of its founding.
"And we had no idea that the disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
We have therefore taken one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, namely that when there is doubt and a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, may result, exclusion measures should be taken.
In April 1999, blood was refused from those who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Now, for some years, it has been shown beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This incident has shown us that the precautionary principle made sense".
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NATs), which detect the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors rather than antibodies to it, on which previous tests were based.
The NATs have shortened the window period, from when a person contracted the disease to when the first viruses can be detected in the blood with our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and thus failing to identify them has thus been greatly reduced.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before anyone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood samples each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion is detected.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to restore health, says the head of the Héma-Québec administration.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not more than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island. Like the West Nile virus, it is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant", continues Dr. Décary, before pointing out that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also ensure that it provides enough.
"Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors, who on average make up only 3% of Quebecers eligible as donors".
However, all healthy persons over 18 years of age who meet the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who volunteer as donors are not accepted, because if they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The shortage is very rare.
But the members of this group of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but more importantly to keep them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that it is hard to find an hour to donate blood", lamented Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Héma-Québec, which runs the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
Once considered biomedical waste, the umbilical cord is rich in stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated the deposit of our thousandth cord blood sample a few weeks ago and plan to draw more than a thousand each year.
They should be available for transplantation early next year", says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it", as Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the semi-final
The Impact Montreal have qualified for the semi-finals of the A-League playoffs, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a decisive second game of the quarterfinals at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless first half on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
We recall that in the first game of the round-robin on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler's got a 3-1 lead in the comeback game with a 4-3 win, but the Whitecaps will still be in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later today.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadien and his aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first game, scored a goal, had two assists, and collected a pass for the win, in the fourth of the Hab's preliminary games.
The only network signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet", warned the Russian.
I need another game to get comfortable".
"He tried to overdo it in the first period", noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation".
Charest points north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
After the Liberal Party's general council, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
'Widening the boundaries of our last great northern frontier' is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, with tools with a strong visual impact, at the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mill with images".
On three screens, they were confused with spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining farms, images of Quebec as seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Big media, like a full campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The Northern Plan is the fourth item in a 'project' which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a 'new economic area', which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the territory north of the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities would be in the implementation of future projects.
He has at most limited himself to what he considers to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, which has seen several improvements as a result of the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "territory twice the size of France" is here, in Quebec.
It is not only here, but it is in us", he insisted, as if to call out a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future", he added, after a dramatic pause to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador which Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been reached for a long time and when the opportunity arises I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government", he said.
Moreover, "considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North", he said, referring to the North-West Passage, which will be open all year round because of the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers it a duty to occupy the territory.
What about the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would be in their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former PQ member from Ungva), have already launched a consultation of some 30 communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) is a key member, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "common visions will be provided".
The development of the North would, moreover, be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be 'coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment', he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the Liberal Prime Ministers who preceded it.
"Like the liberals who have gone before us, we know how to distinguish ourselves in turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail party celebration to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's headquarters.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Beauharnois Power Station into the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, the creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, the creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to shape the future", said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, another reference was made, this time to the conservative programme "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
The Commission has also taken the view that the aid is not compatible with the internal market.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will make it", he confessed to his supporters, to applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, particularly with a Federal Council mission to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed like oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the draft Northern Plan was received with scepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
She said the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, had not respected its application.
If she had done so, "we would have made progress today", commented Marois alongside Jean-Talon's candidate (scrutiny took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that it supported the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
"What we hope is that this is not simply perceived as a show", said leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, returning from holiday.
Letters - A country disgraced
It was Vic Toews, former Justice Minister in the Harper cabinet, who dared to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a "disgrace" to Canada.
To disgrace in this way a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved which has not repatriated a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the events he is accused of.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, has reneged on its word and let a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
For your information, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association in particular are calling for Omar Khadra to be returned to Canada so that he can be tried in a fair trial.
It is the very government that turns a blind eye to torture: it gives little thought to the fact that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of suffering.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", a word that Harper never stops flaunting and which sounds so nonsensical on his lips.
We have reached the point where there is no longer any morality: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the discretion of a government leader who has been a minority until now (see what happens after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches virtue, respect for law and order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Therein lies the shame, Mr Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free speech - The Orwellian speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and managing director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation suit against three authors and a small, disreputable publishing house with the intention of initiating a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in a defamation case, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to take a position contrary to his.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a considerable sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these unfair armed conflicts, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that will silence the opposition and scare anyone who dares to speak out again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that it should have presented its view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada debates are normally held by exchange of views and not by a trickle.
It would have been enough for society to open its books, its papers, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have much confidence in the public and is badly rejecting petitions and letters of support from Black Canadian authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate when his contempt for that same public is so evident?
In the Vice President's world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to the well-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the slanderers have a say.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the light of what many perceive as a kind of muffling (looking for the "public debate", Barrick Gold just gave the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum instructing them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the lawsuit brought by Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to quote authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are uncomfortable for the richest companies in the world, or multiple lawsuits, who will do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do it by following the scientific norms as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have a right to a reply.
The university environment, of which we are a part, has long been capable of handling debate and disagreement and of resolving conflict.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the academic community, as is the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive litigation.
Operation - rescue for Wall Street  Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representing both the Republican and Democratic parties, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest financial bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been plaguing Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
It includes, in particular, checks on the actual implementation of the scheme by elected officials, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to limit the number of houses foreclosed for non-payment, and an inspection fee on the salaries paid to the managers of protected enterprises.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiator Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement", said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"That's the bottom line: if we hadn't acted this way, there would have been an inestimable amount of discomfort and turmoil in the daily lives of Americans", said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The agreed time limit was the market opening this morning.
The two US presidential candidates, who later joined the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their dissatisfaction before adopting extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, particularly the one that will allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries for the directors of state-owned enterprises.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary", he commented on the American TV screen.
When asked by another channel if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I'd like to analyze the details, but I hope so".
"From what I've read, it's something we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward".
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable", he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayer money the dubious loans, risky assets and investable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that led first to the collapse of risky mortgages (mortgages), then to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and resulted in liquidity freezing and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who aired the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that dead end since the Democrats accepted that the "toxic" assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet all of them, a provision was added in Congress that if the government were to face losses over the next five years because of this program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, to which 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further vote in Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get stakes in the sheltered companies that will pay dividends if profitable and can be resold when the tide is out.
Under the plan, the Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure proceedings for real estate loans and set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to the directors of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives, and a vote in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given a green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the bill, both on the Republican and Democratic sides.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you", Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not to take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed the "skeptics caucus", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: we ask the Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to consider carefully the way forward", he said yesterday.
At the same time, the global nature of the crisis was once again being demonstrated in Europe.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would abandon the purchase of its competitor, which was in complete bankruptcy after losing €2 billion ($2.9 billion) to the mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurers.
'It is not money wasted,' said the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In return, they gain influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It is certainly something that savers and families appreciate in these uncertain times".
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank that is in the throes of financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently being made by Bradford and Bringley, including more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be buying the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the start of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalised by the British Government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his ace in the hole, for others his weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have banished him from that circle of powerful ones devoted to real sacred monsters.
What a consistency!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 at his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer, remains one of the last iconic American film stars of the silent era.
Less monumental than Brando, who he resembled and who for a long time was a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also he was a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often have magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will emerge one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A lowly ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because he was a country-spanning safe-made man, a proud combat veteran of the Pacific War, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in film.
That same civil rights activist was also the car driver who placed second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as a sex symbol, though part of a model pair since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him goes the shadowy areas of a secretive, discreet, busy star, allergic to the scandals of show business, whose mystery will never be fully unraveled.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend, the passing of Paul Newman has been a heartbreaking moment for film fans, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is reproposed through his interpretations.
They confuse the memory of Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy and that boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Burning Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that didn't deliver on its promises.
Many other Paul Newmans have passed down through history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiards player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Spaghetti Man (1961), Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him the only Oscar out of 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years, it was his.
He's here again.
The ages follow through on its path.
Young people know him best for the cult movie Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with one last Irish mob godfather role in It Was My Father, in 2003.
Unlike the more established film legends who left the business early, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glitz, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French film-loving man, described it, with a touch of irony, as "a living challenge to underplaying", judging its performances as exaggerated.
The profession wasn't always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic, alcoholic, or desperate characters, of whom he expressed disdain and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown shades of his true, modest sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated Harry and Son to him in 1984, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes poured down on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in The Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with endless sadness, "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love of life, two great characteristics of the late actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, he's a great civil rights activist, environmentalist, independent filmmaker, a challenger to the Hollywood drift.
We'll have seen his face stand out on vinegar bottles, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging it a choice of bad taste, though born as a gag.
The proceeds from those sales, however, went to his Foundation for Children in Need.
Newman, instead of leaning on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said, "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
It was a privilege to be there".
And it was just as privileged for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, then, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Associates factories?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within a criminal association that caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecution, the money obtained from tendering was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities by means of false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totalling 65 million florins, has partly ended up in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, as made known by the investigating authorities, they have drawn the money obtained from competitive tenders on the basis of invoices for transactions which do not exist and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
The invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue invoices, it was established among other things during the hill trip over the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession, he had to choose between boarding houses and restaurants.
The Commission has requested invoices for consumption, and invoices have been prepared for the tendering procedures, among others, for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Budapest Municipality.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports necessary to obtain the funds.
One of the choices of the "studios trip" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and associates in 2003, the restaurant served meals to a group of 90 people from Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But so many people, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the restaurant at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later renamed Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, however the bill included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fancy invoices were exaggerating when they reported Pigal Kft., also a catering company, whose accounts - according to the information provided to the judicial authorities - did not even contain documents in the name of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he immediately realized that they were false documents.
"The stamp had the name and VAT number of our company in the wrong place".
He added: "Besides the formal reasons, it was not even possible to accept the fact that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have 11 rooms and there are not so many beds.
The bill was for catering, and their restaurant has been out of business for a while.
The constant invoicing staff did not bother to find out that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only arranges trips abroad, so they foolishly pointed out on the invoice that cash-paid trips to Hungary were not in line with the company's invoicing practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also contained VAT, while the travel activity to countries outside the European Union is VAT-free.
Moreover, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the VAT on the services offered by the company was 15% and not 25% as indicated on the invoices, and the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, whereas the manufactured invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the 'issuers' ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as carried out the transport of goods by road, as it is known from the prosecution's proceedings, an activity which was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
Furthermore, due to formal defects - the case was filed in the form of a non-conforming invoice, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were false.
The same was true of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Ground, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület lunched there, which is why the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he issued that invoice.
They've been billing people knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue fake invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the Együtt foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fake invoices.
Together with Zuschlag and partners, Biogate Kft, currently in liquidation, also collaborated, providing invoices worth around HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association in 2003, which did not have any real economic activity behind them.
No movement of money because the prepared invoices were then returned, but the associations forgot to make this point in their documents.
The following group of invoicing firms are those that are linked to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorised to the address of the Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of IT equipment, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, purchased these invoices.
The CEO of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov allegedly forwarded the documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, admitted to issuing invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the countervalue was collected from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the firms were in operation, because the defendant claimed that they had not been employed.
The companies were nevertheless useful to him because, at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, draftsman of the company's articles of association, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of HUF 14,2 million.
Prosecutors believe Kubatov pocketed 10% of the invoice amounts, plus the VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fake invoices, manufactured for Biztos Pont's call for competition.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a tender for the public utility body of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins each but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
To prevent this from coming to light, they submitted to TMA five fake invoices received by Works Team Kft.
These bills were found during a search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, as the prosecutor has already done, some of the defendants will probably report on the progress of the invoice production.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything in a comprehensive way, he has not done so yet.
It is to be seen whether it is in his interest, it may also be that the Socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in return for compensation of 50 million florins, a large part of the damage - would be willing to be the scapegoat.
Mr Zuschlag could also have been offended at the moment, since his requests for relief from his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have not been met.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid to the victims of the terrorist attacks.
The psychology of over-bidding: Why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Researchers, neuroscientists and economists at New York University, have been able to discover the neuro-economic basis of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
Their study, published in the journal Science, found that men do not want to fall behind in a competition such as the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay even higher prices.
The research has tried to trace the neural pattern of this "match" at the nervous system level by experimental tricks.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction, and they used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the essential element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex comes into intense action when you lose the game.
This brain area, along with other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So the researchers say the price increase is explained by the striated body's fierce reaction to the scanning.
To support their theory, the economists in the research group carried out a financial tracking survey.
In this survey three groups bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the actual value of the product concerned and they made their bet.
Another group was promised another $15 prize if they won.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose money if they lost the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that one group was highlighted as winning, while the other group was highlighted as losing.
Testing the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the "lose" group were willing to bet higher than the control or "win" group.
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
The Commission has also been able to provide a number of proposals for the future of the European Union.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, professor at the New York University School of Economics.
Hepatitis - When to See a Doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients is 100,000, of whom only 7,000 are treated, because many do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name for infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical being hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food chain (e.g. infected water and food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
It is useful for travellers to be vaccinated against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After that, yellow spots form on the skin and the white of the eyes, stools become clear and urine dark, and healing occurs within two to three weeks.
A million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten people receive treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: If left untreated, it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know they have the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20 to 30 years.
So it is very important to prevent and to carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus now stands at 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worthwhile to consult your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
If the disease is recognized early, it is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus stopping the infectious power and preventing the formation of tumors.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first celebrated in 2004 by disease associations around the world.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early detection of the disease.
Do people who believe in God feel less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith acts as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects the feeling of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph.
In the rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were electrocuted while all were observing a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
By exploring the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research projects involving not only academics but also scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University.
The test went exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was attached to the left hand of the subject.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the Cinderella painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive sets, while they were either observing the religious painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made them feel "secure", as if "someone was taking care" of them and "they were reassured and filled with peace".
When they looked at the religious image, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image that has a strong effect even on atheists, but the right image must be found.
"We need to look for an image that they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father", the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it does change our personality", Wright added.
After the excellent results, the only question remains: If the faithful are presented with a painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of a similar caliber, what effect might it have on pain control?
Would a vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say you are
On the day of a person's tenth birthday, Google can claim to be as much in their pockets as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what clinic they attend, and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the firm's directors, this is not enough.
As for the skeptics who compare it to the Orwellian nightmare, they don't really see the substance of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of the founders of Google which was: "let's put all the information in the world into one system!".
According to the Google CEO interviewed by the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to know the answers to questions like "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what would be the right job for me?" But software can't answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that when they search the Internet, the exact words they search for, the IP address from which they search and the page they stop at after searching are recorded.
The Personalized Search, which was launched two years ago, allows users to store their browsing history, to look at what they have searched for and clicked on, which will in the long run lead to much better results; the same logic is used for Recommendations, where the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and recorded preferences.
What if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - ask users concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the reactions of the netizens are caused by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against the power.
One fact is confirmed, however, namely that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights sighed with relief in May when the firm - in agreement with the EFF e-law protection association - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even then you cannot force Google by any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped up nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to get the individual users' search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to give their personal data are rushing to Google because they believe that their privacy will be affected by starting to use its services and they rise up with the rebellion of multinationals that stand out for their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users appearing in many countries see them as the next generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to their rival, Microsoft, liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both are fighting for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is kept up to date and the software package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it could also be because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these channels changes for each individual, the essence is the same: to show ourselves.
A young media person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm which lists his musical tastes, all of these can be entered into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, he can also write blogs where his latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
In the meantime, we read of numerous examples where it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, easily knows with whom her unfaithful boyfriend spent the night or a company can fire an employee because he wrote a sincere opinion about the company's top: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has now been completely reconsidered.
People who live online make sure that they show themselves, and so we can formulate the basic thesis behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do so (starting with, for example, Scroogle using Google's search engine but at the same time voluntarily not leaving traces).
There are many people who don't sign up for community pages on purpose so they won't be found, and Google's online applications, from word processing to image management to news gathering, can be replaced by alternative versions that aren't tied to huge server parks and that don't make up our best profile yet.
The public is not so much waiting in secret for the moment when Google pulls out its claws.
At present, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, services introduced in record time instead cause great discomfort not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development firms.
However, critical observers find some alarming points alongside all this: the company's top management, for example, has completely rejected the protest of employees after doubling the company's nursery rate, has found the repeated daily catering to the employees' pleasure too expensive, all this however diminishes the fact that in 2006 Google bowed its head to the Chinese government and according to their agreement the company will filter all results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it is ready to be used, but one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines of Google will take such proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, medical and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database may offer good material for the next generation of science fiction writers. Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, where a man with Google data can be approached in alarming ways.
Two minors helped the double murderer of Ózd to cover his tracks
Police have questioned two minors in connection with Ózd's double murder, who are well suspected of helping to cover up the crime, the Borsod regional police spokesman said on Tuesday.
The young men have admitted to the crime they are accused of, and are currently charged with favouring the victims.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI, are defending themselves on the loose.
Favoring is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in Ózd's double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was remanded in custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in multiple murder for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old was heavily in debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, so last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in Ózd where he killed himself and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million, or about CZK 5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the shares listed on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the Polish bid despite the Czechs having previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
The Polish State holds 99% of the shares and intends to sell over 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the Polish bid is the highest ever for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have all made offers.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the parties concerned, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
The shareholders' agreement was that almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banka Česká Spořitelna with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13,5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of the European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday comments on the international economic crisis are already talking about "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster was caused by the American president - La Repubblica accuses - who was unable to bring his own party together behind a law that was quickly repealed, the purpose of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as the billionaire financier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second September 11.
Even a section of the Madrid press sees Washington as a scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has pushed the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the whole world will suffer as a result.
Bush's plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, reports the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout to the failing financial institutions and with taxpayer money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the financial resources nor the improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, according to the Viennese Der Standard, which said that fears were growing that European taxpayers, like those in the US, would have to use their own money to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been too concerned about the crisis that has swept through the old continent like a tsunami.
The 'saviors' should not wave the €100 billion immediately, but it would be better if they could determine when it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the hornet
What better way to develop collision-prevention technology than by mimicking the obstacle sensors found in nature?
Like the ones in the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the Calabrian engineers gave Nissan the initial strategic cue on how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic mini-car with bee-like properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
When bees fly, they form their own oval personal space that is very similar to our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's eye, which can see 300 degrees in any direction.
Engineers have tapped into the idea of the telemetric laser to replicate the function of the bee's vision.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor which immediately turns it into a command to avoid a collision.
In a split second, the robot senses the obstacle and then, imitating the bee's movements, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance, unlike the present system, is entirely instinctive.
"Without this, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the vulnerable, innermost layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot be up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
So instead of the infinite possibilities for bees to scrape other bees, the robot can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
BR23C is powered by lighter, higher energy density lithium polymer batteries, which means that their life span is longer than that of lithium ions.
Andoh believes that what is important is the instantaneity of intelligent reaction, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot has to process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to memorize them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
You don't need a gigabyte or a megabyte of memory.
This is the first step towards developing an immediate collision avoidance technology which Nissan expects will be available on production vehicles within 10 years.
Further application can be provided by the integration with the GPS satellite navigation system which, by avoiding obstacles on the road, leads to the destination.

The written version of the $700 billion bailout bill for the purchase of disproportionate credit has been drafted, to be implemented in several parts.
The first step is to spend half the amount.
In the new deal, which was extended until midnight Saturday, Eastern Time, congressional leaders agreed to a $700 billion bailout after days of debate, Reuters reported.
We have made serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives, who said that all that remained was to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: "The program will work and be effective, but there is still a lot to do".
The written version of the plan was released before the Asian markets opened at 8 a.m. Washington time (2 p.m. Central European time on Monday), but it did not bring much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 regarding the program, then it will go to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy", White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which envisaged that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of bonds with disproportionate credit behind them.
Now as a first step, you can spend up to half of the $700 billion, $250 billion immediately after the vote of Congress on Monday, with which the Treasury Department will buy bonds with disproportionate credits behind it, of the fate of the remaining $100 billion the president will decide.
A special board will oversee the program, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion is dependent on a new act of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: it can buy loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans at the same time.
The purchase can be done through auctions and directly - the ministry officials announced.
The legal rule makes it possible for the firms concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Treasury guarantees the means of concern, for which the firms will pay a price appropriate to the probable damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the means necessary for 700 billion dollars to come in for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it be to buy the wrong financial instruments, or to insure them, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make sure we are ready to introduce the newly signed law, he added.
Instead, the managers of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think that the government will limit their exit, which is simply described in overseas slang as a golden parachute.
Limitations on payments will only be in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury will provide the aid.
Basically, the limitation means that if the ministry buys at auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, unless they retire the bankrupt bank manager.
When direct purchases of disproportionate loans are made, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that directors' money is not overspent.
In addition, existing contracts for the Golden Parachute will not be changed, the limitation is only for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that a legal limitation on the remuneration of general managers has been put in place, said Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the participating banks, reducing the risk to the taxpayers, since they can also gain from it if the economy, and with it the bailed-out bank, recovers.
The bill includes a five-year proposal from the president to Congress on how to reimburse taxpayers for projected losses in the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American people have asked us to do, not to defend taxpayer dollars, said Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California.
Your Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur believes that the action was taken by the very people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic industrial sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0,1% compared to the previous month, or 12,9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Statistical Institute.
The export sales prices of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher by 1,1% compared to the previous year and decreased by 3,9%.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than a year ago.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased by only 0.1% compared with the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1%, compared with July.
The largest price increases in August 2008 were in the leather and footwear sector (2,8%), mainly in bags and belts with a 4.6% increase and in footwear production with a 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastics and chemicals has led to a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the products and chemicals sector.
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the manufacture of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a lesser extent in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices rose by between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in industrial domestic sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas effected by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared with 12 months, taking into account domestic sales of the manufacturing industries, the largest increases were in the petroleum products processing sector (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metal products, prices rose by 13.2%, with the production of food, beverages and tobacco accounting for 11% of the increase.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the manufacture of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase varied from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In the manufacturing industry, prices rose by 10.2% in the year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector were 18.7% higher than last year.
In domestic sales among the target groups of sectors, the largest monthly price increase occurred in August in sectors producing capital goods (0.7%).
In the consumer goods sectors prices rose by 0.3%, in the energy and after-use sectors prices were unchanged compared with the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase was observed in the energy and downstream sector (16.8%), compared to the same month last year.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, while in the investment goods sector a decrease of 1.4% was recorded.
Industrial export sales prices in guilders increased by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month, and fell by 3.9% over the same period.
The Hungarian guilder weakened against the euro by 1.7% in one month, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared with August 2007 and strengthened against the euro by 7.5% and against the dollar by 15.9%.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that the US-Hungary visa-free agreement could come into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister has spoken about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives there.
In his view, 'everything now depends on the fact that the electronic entry and control system is built in time overseas'.
He also called for the EU to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's citizens are not forced to leave the EU.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister will continue her talks in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will award the medal of the Order of the Cross of the Hungarian Republic with Star and hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also backed the bank bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, pledged their support for the government's $700 billion plan to bail out the banks on Sunday, but there are politicians calling for the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
Representatives of Congress and the administration announced Sunday night that after days of marathon negotiations, they had reached an agreement in principle on a bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to unblock the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove themselves better than their rival to get the country out of the recession.
According to the latest polls with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has regained some of the lead, while McCain's lead, which he gained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president, has disappeared.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contained those consumer protection steps which he also supported.
"We must act responsibly now . . . , the danger threatens your jobs, your savings, all industrial sectors, the complete economic stability", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He did not shy away from calling McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that "we're all going to have a hard time bringing this situation down . . . but doing nothing is not a viable path".
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a committee to oversee the finance minister and limiting the good outcomes of top managers, things he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no credible role in the deal, but he was in daily contact with the secretary.
President Nancy Pelosi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
German-language press
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal.
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Parents, analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem for all Christian democracy, including Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was feasible exactly ten years ago ended: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the UCS had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50% threshold.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 again during the period of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
This is due to the consequent modernization of the region, which is devouring parents.
The social scientists predicted this 40 years ago, but they were far wrong, but secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of the voters to the CSU.
Modernisation is accompanied by increased opportunities and the political consequences are clear.
The right-wing is intact, only within the right-wing the voters have become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classical bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the self-employed, the craftsmen, the graduates and the graduates.
Here support for CSU has fallen below 40%.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal.
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who with whom?" in its article "The party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused internal political situation in Austria created by the elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, now it's all about the coalition; in the debate on public television the party leaders have barely shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible in some regions and in the social partnership that already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any event.
Repeat in this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open matter within the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
BZÖ leader Jörg Haider reiterated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing" - said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, organised this year by France, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, has opened in Paris today.
In her message to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress, Lívia Járóka, MEP from the European People's Party, called attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was attended by governments, the European social partners and representatives of the major European civil society and equal opportunities organisations.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP parliamentary group, pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low education.
"Most young Roma do not have an intermediate level of education and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a small number of them can attain a higher level of education".
Járóka also stressed the key role of education as a fundamental human right in ensuring human rights.
Investing in Roma children's education can mean strengthening the economies of EU Member States.
The Member believes that these links need to be made known to the wider Roma-non-Roma community.
The earlier a Roma starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid on income and consumption, he contributes to the national budget.
"The right of European citizenship for Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-quality and segregated schools", stressed Lívia Járóka.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following categories of measures:
'The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe,' she said.
In the context of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities' to be ensured for all, the aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been organised every year since last year's Berlin meeting, is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at national and European level.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
The fate of the Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided at the end of October.
Despite the disastrous electoral defeat, the heads of the Bavarian CSU have not yet fallen, but the discussion of personal matters has been postponed for the time being.
The party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein are still in office, the question is how long the pity will last.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic 17% vote loss, will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
The two critically acclaimed politicians have made it clear that they are not attached to the chair with all their might.
They have tried to soften the anger of members of the parliamentary group and the grassroots that the day after the Bavarian tsunami they claimed personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, then at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union got 60.7%, now after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU has been the "absolute monarch" in Bavaria for 46 years, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
The Conservatives still count on the southern region, which is of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, but they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice-president and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gains a seat in the narrow exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors, who represent right-wing values, for a possible government coalition in Munich.
By a strange twist of fate, the list of Free Electors includes Gabriele Pauli, whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple to treat the woman of great ambitions without regard.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their efforts on some way to stabilize Beckstein.
The former regional governor and former CSU president called 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bold statements to the CSU, saying they deserved more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the national victory in 2005, is re-established with joint forces.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
This is certainly a relative fact: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats is still ongoing.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
The President of the Republic of Belarus:
Not a single opposition representative entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is a sign of the well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is explained by the fraud committed in the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Even though the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition, which gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS), had a serious hope that Lukashenko, with his presidential term renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections held under disputed circumstances, would "grant" some seats in parliament to opposition representatives.
The SDGs have thus waived a boycott previously assessed.
The opposition's expectation was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has requested a loan to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and has agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines owned by Beltransgaz that run through the country, was going to improve relations with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter because of the political situation in Belarus, which is considered undemocratic.
It referred to a relaxation in the OSCE's assessment of the election campaign, which emphasised positive movements rather than shortcomings, such as the prohibition of standing for one third of opposition candidates.
But the OSCE's quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
The opposition, however, sees a marked improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared for a small confrontation with Moscow, and Georgia continues to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has been considering the two countries independent for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that "the government was afraid to let even one opposition member into a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not plan to protest the results but rather tries to get the message out to voters that economic reforms are needed.
Obviously we have many problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the most officially helped class, that of the pensioners, does not consider the Lukashenko regime adequate which considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the growing economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security system is dismantled "which is reminiscent of the grave silence", Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections to be democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
"From now on, breakfast before work".
Never before in the history of Palazzo Chigi have there been revolving doors for employees to enter and exit.
But today, we're going to start this new measure against the smart-ass, the one who knocks and then goes to the bar for coffee during business hours.
The anti-Fanulloni initiative was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Rotating doors", says Brunetta, "are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services".
"Now a new era of accountability and transparency is opening.
This is reformism", Brunetta continues.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
Masi said that "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the Secretary-General assured: "It was a process shared by the workers and everyone collaborated".
I mean, no more breakfast on the clock, no more coffee and cornetto.
As Brunetta suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
The Minister also noted that "in three months, sickness absences among public employees have fallen by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people at work in one year".
It also says that the public administration must be made more efficient.
The Minister explained that the Italian economy, "whose wage dynamics have been double that of the private sector and well above inflation rates in the last 8-10 years".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the provisions of the Brunetta decree by joining the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Works is now boasting about the lowest number of sickness absenteeism", writes the consumer association, "the 'working motherfucker' population is growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and productive public servants in Italy have united to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree".
In particular, the TAR will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatment for sickness dependent on service; the extension of the time slots within which sick workers can be contacted for inspection visits; and other aspects contained in the new provisions proposed by the Minister.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of accidents at work.
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains a leading cause of death, causing almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this tragic issue, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, which is celebrated on the second Sunday of October in all the Italian provinces.
"The worrying data published by Anmil and the same tragic news reports of recent days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is", says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of the Disabled and Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his "very deep appreciation for the constant association's commitment to workplace prevention, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of victims' families and the raising of public awareness".
"There has naturally been a 'enough' indignation, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies which, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion but the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school system to increase awareness among young people entering the world of work are particularly important.
It is necessary to keep the attention on this phenomenon, not to let the alarm about its social gravity be dampened, and to apply and improve the legislative provisions.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment to put an end to it urgently".
"The data on workplace injuries seem to be showing a slight positive trend, but that does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive", said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this 'downward trend' to result in less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that, overall, too little is being done to combat the phenomenon of accidents and that this can be done through a number of actions.
In our opinion, more controls and inspections are needed, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, starting from the school world".
"More work needs to be done on communication and public awareness.
But above all, it requires a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in relation to a phenomenon which represents a social emergency".
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistive drift towards which the system has been pushing in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker", he added, "so that the fate of the injured person does not have to depend on spontaneities or on the provision of time by the legislator".
MP3 players under indictment, endangering hearing
Listening to loud music for a prolonged period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
The European Commission has published a press release in Brussels, citing the opinion of the EU's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), published today.
"This scientific opinion", the note says, "shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices for more than one hour a week while holding the device at a high volume risk permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high noise levels may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably", says Meglena Kuneva.
'Scientific evidence shows a clear risk and we must react quickly.
More importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology.'
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be consulted on the possible effects of the measures on the environment.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now consider together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical instruments and related equipment".
There is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce this damage by means of solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure times.
In its opinion, the European Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical equipment who listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current maximum noise limits in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for longer periods are at risk of permanent hearing loss after a period of five years.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno launches Commission for the future of the capital
We start today, close in March, and we'll draw in June.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of Rome, which has moved into its new premises behind the Baths of Caracalla this morning.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the batting cuts are closed in March, the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that the strategic plan for Rome can be presented in June with the "official ballot" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented", Alemanno points out. "It will have to make proposals for a development idea for Rome which the political decision-makers, which remain the City Council and the City Council, can then use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is to be found, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, your contribution will be essential.
Too often politics is about managing the day-to-day and emergencies that come up from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future".
The mayor of Rome also wants to point out that 'this Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wheelchair: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro and will serve to reason and involve the best minds of the capital'.
For Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor stationary, to allow our city to make a real leap of the level it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit about its future".
A future which, the mayor of Rome said, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital but "also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician who wants us to pass for independents wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter,who decimated the US economy with his decisions and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
Attacks on Obama are mounting as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a web site: "This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big face: he thinks he's going to win the highest office in a nation that's had two governors and five black senators in all!"
They're actually attacks that don't say much; they're clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: Will he be a good president? And then there's the polls; everyone says Obama will win and by a good margin.
Again, some speak with their hearts but not their brains.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: Once in the voting booth, we know for sure who the American patriot will cast his vote for.
It's a side of the American mentality that's been kept hidden to the last.
"Say what you want, and we'll figure out where to put the crossbow, whether it's Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
Things I've never said before, which seems almost certain to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people, what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure, and 89 percent said, Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq was for the most part Bush's weak spot.
Whoever takes George W.'s place will have a huge task to perform.
In the US, the economic downturn is felt even by journalists: it's time for newspapers to cut back, and many blame the internet, the "killer" of print.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and their mind control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they feel any less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
And the cuts in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the papers together, is a big problem.
This is a problem which, according to the journalists interviewed, must be solved if traditional journalism as understood by the general public is not to become substantially smaller.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national press is going the wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
Major publishing houses are opening up to the Internet, which many see as the "killer" of printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are feeling has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest divide in American journalism today is between who runs the newsrooms -- that is, the editors -- and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationally are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level that percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "safety at work".
Executives who think they're going to lose their jobs in three years are 47% nationally.
For the staff reporters, it's 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge country like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it becomes a matter of "take it or leave it", take it or leave it.
Directors are almost always paid big salaries, while the editor may earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to his pension and insurance payments.
The reasoning for holidays is complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third year, to reach 15 days in total after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, they admit, "sick" often during the year.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: Rome, DANILO Couple remains in the grotto
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the petition of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be moved from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in the investigation into the countercontract relating to the escalation of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him last week, he obtained the release from the domiciliaries transformed into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
The court, however, held that such moves (to which the PM gave a different opinion) would allow him to influence his company and to gain access to the evidence against him.
The Elites in Danger
This phenomenon was already manifested a few days ago with the House of Representatives voting against the $700 billion rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday confirmed that the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old, moderate East Coast soul, which is pro-federal institutions and pro-business, and its new, conservative soul, which is hostile to Washington and the financial world, especially strong in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, which has come alive by the vow I mentioned at the beginning.
This is only one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the economic earthquake is perhaps heralding or is already indicating: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here.
In both the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of long-incinerating phenomena which, in the new climate, are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of state-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, yes, have close links with the outside world, but which, above all, have the budgets of individuals and families living in one country, in one State, very much involved.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those individuals and families who, by the way, are also elected.
So the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the question or to have little to say: the clearest proof is the European Union, which is as usual divided between different interests and between different state strategies and fails to decide on any common policy.
And so it is from the government of each individual State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the allocation of funds: since when you get to the point where it is only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in order.
And they have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which probably no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of to an analogous extent.
This new emphasis on the national-statutory element, which the crisis has placed, is in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that recent developments in the economy tend to attach to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
The paradox is that while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future would instead have to deal increasingly with those very intangible things which are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look, can be transported from one place to another on earth but are still absolutely bound to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So the one who happens to be the ruler of it, certainly has several more cards than the one who is not, the one who is unlucky enough to live in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news, which, however, presages a fracture.
When you say Territory, State, Government, you inevitably say Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who can take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leadership, especially economic ones, which have proved so inadequate and full of shadowy areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and somewhat disturbing: a discredit, a discomfort, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
That is to say, there seems to be a growing conviction in large sections of the population that before their actions were the same ideas as the social elites that have hitherto prevailed, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the general sense of the term, had made their own time and were increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, undergroundly fuels a branching but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political establishments, which is manifested in the sudden electoral "riots" or sudden changes in the collective mood of recent and very recent times, from the rise of conservatism in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, some would say, are finding it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not yet taking shape in the deepest layers of Western societies and which the economic crisis is revitalizing, increasing, potentially stirring up.
In the face of all this, to say that a 'mass rebellion' is on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The superglue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spider-Man.
It's the focus of several American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has gone very close.
Using a sticker of just one square inch [2.5 cm], the researchers were able to hold a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY  The American journal Science published the findings of researchers at the University of Dayton, the University of Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material the team of scientists invented is an evolution of existing materials that use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be thought of as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko's legs, which are covered in microscopic hairs that ensure perfect grip on the animal.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the feet of these reptiles and at the same time "is easily detached from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking about a much less fascinating use, like connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
Nothing superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH  The University of California, Berkeley, is also working on a new sticker.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scholars presented a microfiber-like adhesive that cleans itself of dust as it moves on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicinal products: never with fruit juices
Watch out for grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, alter the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, increasing or decreasing their effectiveness, with serious consequences for health.
Reiterating the risks of packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with taking certain medicines, David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, has issued a new warning since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: Just one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice can reduce the absorption of some life-saving medicines, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already come under fire for being responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to levels considered toxic.
RISK MEDICALS - The Italian Medicines Agency itself had reported this in a newsletter two years ago, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this combination and to be careful about what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
Not Just POMPELMO - Experts say that orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit medication.
Along with the list of inhibited active ingredients in grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies, which may change the drug information notes.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear, do not impress us but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification, the expert told ANSA.
The Nobel Prize in economics is awarded to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most vocal critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had predicted in an editorial in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked much controversy and was repeated to economists for years, but now proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "highly valued economist" but also a "very aggressive" disseminator, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the interface revised and made less Spartan, other more substantial ones are added such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention is also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functionalities of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them via e-mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files in the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
On this front, you can also create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the worksheet you can intervene in several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text editor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some of the functionality of OpenOffice to the web, and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version is available for download at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that was on Mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to the home or workplace on request.
And if the theme of free can be a drag for the spread in the homes, it is precisely in the business area that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects already realized in the public administration and schools.
There is also a lack of establishments offering training, advice and assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business opportunities.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing as opposed to Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for emulating Powerpoint presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now at almost 3.6 million, with the release of the new version it is likely that we can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also tested positive. It's the fourth doping case.
Another positive case at the last Tour de France: it's the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third-placed and winner of the best climber's jersey.
The news was reported by the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth successful rider in the third-generation Cera Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positive in Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place in the Tour and will face two years of canonical disqualification.
The news of Kohl's third-generation EPO positive was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climber's jersey.
The Italian government has been criticized for its lack of transparency.
Italy "has only recently transformed itself from a country of immigrants into a prime destination for immigrants" who are welcomed reluctantly.
This is what is being asked in a long article in the New York Times, which has devoted a long article to the debate on the topic of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young man Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at once the ones with "the most integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
The report also highlighted the growing tensions between Italians and immigrants in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just me.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
This trend was emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students who suffered from high-rent up to 900 euros per room
The rent market for university students is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants' union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on such serious characteristics that it excludes whole groups of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that the families from which they come should bear", explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "In these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that it has triggered a process of generalised increase even for residents".
In most cases, rental offers contain a series of infringements: free-type contracts, unregistered, no fee limit, sub-rent linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed to bring prices down through the revision of taxation.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room it goes from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350-400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it costs 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single bed.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are charged for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only savings are made by moving to outlying areas: 300 euros for a single bed and 450 euros for a single bed in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples, a bed costs 300/450 euros, a room costs 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, 250/350 euros are needed for a bed, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller towns prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater impact on the city economy.
In cities where rents to non-EU students are more frequent, such as Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the fee charged to foreign students is increased by about 25/30% compared with the Italian student fee.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, cities cancel the historic theatres
Historic movie theaters are closing in favor of multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes".
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multi-screen theatres and the consequent death by consumption of single-screen theatres in the central areas of cities, is one of those events which seem to us inevitable and undeniable but which also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
"It's as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions, disappeared", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by ANEC, the main trade association, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and the major losses are borne by the major cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna was the most affected region with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to show that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions have recorded the highest number of new multi-screen cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally", says Paolo Protti, President of ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a town hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplexes.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take a decision on the matter.
It is a shame, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the existing laws.
The sector would need between €16 and €18 million a year to support it.
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about closures, is interesting: it decided to take refuge by signing a protocol between Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-screen cinemas both in the historic centre and in the suburbs.
The rules include tax relief for operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area and will have special parking charges and in some car parks.
'It's an initiative I like,' says Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope other cities will follow Bologna's example by setting up other measures.
But it is certain that to counter the overload of multiplexes traditional theatres also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, so as not to see the blackish signs from the dust, I turn the other way.
Political links and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Joy Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to harmonize the city's decisions with the interests of the Piromalli clan".
The charges against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for foreign competition in a mafia association, are heavy.
Also in handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew, the lawyer, the boss' namesake, already convicted of association for mafia-style delinquency, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense", the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to Piromalli.
"It would have been thus granted to the couscous", the judges write, "to enter officially into the municipalities, facilitating the already extensive possibilities of control and direction of the public administration".
The president of the Calabrian regional council, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized crime are many" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep clean".
This morning's arrests follow those last July when the police announced they had beheaded Piromalli.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved, but already in 1991, and again because of alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of its dissolution, was elected leader of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried out to the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called in the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected the whole thing for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that Piromalli's cousins had even asked for the change of the A3 project.
The environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, showed "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a larger group known to be close to the Piromalli, by harmonizing the choices of the public administration with the interests of the cousin".
When the energy comes from the waves now the big ones come in.
It's an uncontacted deposit, covering over 70% of the planet's surface, and now it's being discovered by the world's big energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable resources that they've set their eyes on, and now they're trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movement of the sea has been studied for over a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental concerns and the new oil boom are giving the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be met by offshore wind turbines.
This would be twice as much as is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there'd be the currents and the tides.
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build a plant in the north of Portugal.
When the deal was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy, and among these companies there is a tradition of traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies", a spokesman for a company affiliated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering cooperating with us".
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission for a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a significant sign, especially when you consider that the United States is still extracting oil in Alaska and that President Bush recently launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are pursuing the sea-based energy path, and the sums invested so far, although details are not known, indicate a rising interest, according to observers.
Technology to be perfected.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its infancy, partly because marine energy does not shy away from all doubts about its environmental impact.
At the moment, plants like the one in Portugal or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to be causing major problems to the ecosystem.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The wave thrust, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
There are currently four such plants in the planning stages, pending federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water in tidal waters causes the blades of the turbines to rotate, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, say the Electric Power Research Institute, is the tidal potential at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It's tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that overlook the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are planning to invest up to $35 million by 2009.
