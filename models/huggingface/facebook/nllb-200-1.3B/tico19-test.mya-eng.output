The rate of the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) has increased rapidly in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Increase Index shows similar trends in the EU/trans-European trade border countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 infection is increasing rapidly in all countries at different rates depending on the country.
Based on the experience in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 infected patients requiring health care and intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown case of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, causing a mass infectious disease outbreak.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control announced that it had detected a novel coronavirus disease causing agent, now known as severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 cases develop pneumonia, but not pneumonia, but a mild respiratory infection, and most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolved into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, and in the remaining 6% of cases, severe illness required intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we will examine the potential COVID-19 outbreaks by country in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom and compare them to China and Hubei.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the UK with the current number of cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to other regions, and the COVID-19 epidemic has surged in the rest of the world.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europeans according to WHO's definition of an outbreak was reported in the March 5 issue of the medical journal Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were detected in France on 24 January 2020, and they were returnees from Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in 30 countries in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the same date, and in one country, Italy, up to 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
The data is based on the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of cases that have been reported.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) updates the COVID-19 infection statistics collected from official sources such as the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the likely COVID-19 situation in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare the situation in those countries with the situation in Italy.
As a sample of the current COVID-19 cases, we calculated the recurrence index of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK over a total of 14 days and beyond from 1 January to 15 March 2020, and considered it as the normal measure of COVID-19.
We also compare the number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 am on 15 March 2020 with the number of cases in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
The likely status of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day COVID-19 case rate increase in countries in the European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom is generally similar to the case rate in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Covering the EU/EEA and UK, the COVID-19 re-infection index started to rise around 21 February and then rose significantly around 28 February 2020 (in appendix).
This is mainly due to the surge in the number of cases reported in Italy, which has also shown a similar rise in COVID-19 cases (follow-up data) in all countries in the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK.
Figure 2 compares the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
The report, published on Tuesday, shows that 15 other European Union (EU) /European Economic Area (EEA) countries and the UK have released a total number of cases comparable to the number of cases in Italy at 8:00 am on March 15.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 infections in the EU/EEA and UK is rising rapidly.
The observed trend in COVID-19 prevalence indicates that the epidemic is increasing at the same rate in all countries.
National public health responses are at different levels and under different circumstances in different countries, and variations in epidemiological criteria and procedures for selecting patients for COVID-19 testing, including combination testing, continue to exist.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas in Italy reported that about 10% of patients infected with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum patient tolerance.
At the EU/EEA level, only 6% and 1% of the population of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals and/or intensive care units are available (data not disclosed).
However, they should be surveyed in a systematic manner to strengthen the existing data monitoring focused on reporting cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study found that the number of beds for intensive care and interim care in Europe varies significantly from country to country, with Germany having 29.2 beds per 100,000 population, while Portugal has only 4.2 beds.
This means that they may have more resources than Italy (which had 12.5 ICU and ICU beds per 100,000 people in 2010-2011) and may even have fewer.
The sixth update of the ECDC Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment includes the projections of outbreaks of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a risk of exceeding 90% of the number of intensive care units available in EU/EEA countries and the UK.
The disease is concentrated in some regions of the EU/EEA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically only treat a specific local population, so information on outbreaks and intensive care units should be made available to local units for Nomenclature Level 2 (NUTS-2) statistics.
The experience gained from Italy and the current prospects in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly evolving in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the region and to respond to the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care and especially intensive care, as is the case in the most affected areas of Italy.
A rapid, prepared and comprehensive approach to disease control is essential to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, as indicated in the recent ECDC Emergency Risk Assessment.A pre-expected surge in the number of patients could result in insufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand the disease situation and respond appropriately.
Rapid risk assessments also outline public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short-term opportunity for countries to further step up their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressures on healthcare.
If this is not achieved, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and other parts of the world and infected more than 80,000, causing a catastrophic human crisis.
Similar to its cousin SARS-CoV, which caused SARS infection in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by bats, causing similar symptoms through a similar organ system.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and deadly than SARS, but it is more widespread and infects older adults more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topics.
We will cover a wide range of topics, including epidemiology, the study of the cause of the disease, the study of the virus, diagnosis, treatment, epidemiological evaluation and prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help us understand the threat of the disease and help to eradicate it.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, became an unforgettable memory for all Chinese citizens who were urged to stay indoors for several weeks during and after the holiday period due to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003, so on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 and the related disease as CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than 40,000 have been discharged from hospital, and more than 3,000 deaths.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the public enemy number one and may be even more powerful than terrorism.
The first report to explore the sequence of the virus after isolating several patients was published on January 7, 2020, according to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), and in the two months since, more than 200 papers have been published on the study of the virus, the study of the epidemic, the study of the cause of the disease, the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
This review attempts to summarize the ongoing research on a rapidly evolving new subject area:
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other COVID-borne diseases, such as Middle East respiratory disease (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will discuss all we know about the prevention and prognosis of the disease so far, as well as some of the remaining pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally harmless pathogens to humans, and primarily cause approximately 15% of the common cold in stage 4.
However, we have seen two high-risk CoVs in humans this century: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to other countries with alarming infection rates and mortality rates.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in human history.
The mass outbreak of chronic pneumonia of unknown origin, as shown in Figure 1.1, was first reported to the National Health Commission of China in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the follow-up status of the coronavirus was released.
The first death was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to border cities, states and countries.
On 20 January, the infection was reported to health workers, who assessed the transmission from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan suspended all public transportation in Wuhan and declared the city under lockdown.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease found that of the 41 confirmed infected patients, only 21 had contact with the Wuhan seafood market, where the initial outbreak is believed to have originated from an unidentified animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
The situation is changing and the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
According to a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 COVID-19 positive patients as of February 11, 2020, the most up-to-date information on the pandemic is available at the following link.
SARS-CoV-2 can be infected at any age, but is predominantly found in the age group of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, with very low incidence among those under 20 years of age, with only 14 cases among those under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more prevalent among men (0.27/100,000) than among women (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread massively, mainly in and around Hubei Province.
From outbreak to diagnosis, COVID-19 takes an average of 5 days (2-9 days).
The average gestation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset of symptoms to death is 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The basic reproducibility factor (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI, 3.51-4.05) and the conditionally adjusted R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections had multiplied by January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time when many transport vehicles are running ahead of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate for the confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the all-patient adjusted mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk groups for COVID-19 are men, people aged 60 and over, and people with severe lung disease.
CoVs are a subgenus of large, single-stranded RNA, DNA-sealing viruses.
They can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are transmissible to humans.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the Envelope Spike (S) glyco protein is formed by the adhesion of its cell receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and depeptidyne peptides 4 (DPP4), respectively.
Release of viral RNA genome into cytoplasm: After viral genome replacement, the genetic RNA, which consists of a sealed glycoprotein and nucleotide, becomes an infectious form containing plasmas, which fuses with the plasma tissue membrane and releases the virus.
On 10 January 2020, the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was detected.
Ten genetic samples collected from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, Huanan, the epicenter of the outbreak, identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new beta-CoV strain with a genetic match of over 99.98%.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV genetically.
When viewed through an electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected within the ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory tract surface membrane.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVs.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 that is attached to human ACE2 is weaker than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may also be a variant of the short novel protein produced by orf3b and the cell-derived protein produced by orf8.
Although orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 virus may be a virulent marker and may inhibit IFNβ occurrence, orf8 does not contain any known impact domain or structure.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others presented a cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 mixed with amino acid transporter B0AT1 at a 2.9 Å resolution.
It was found that the closed-open structural group formed a dimer, where ACE2-B0AT1 group could bind two S proteins, which could be considered as evidence of CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target in drug trials to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original recipient and the intermediate recipient
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses originated in bats and have been known to be transmitted to humans via cat and camel.
A comparison of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs showed that the new virus was 96% identical to SARS-like CoVs in bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21, suggesting that bats were the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the species barrier and pass to humans is still unknown and the route of transmission remains to be clarified.
Ji and others suggested that the snake could be a vector in the transmission of the virus from bats to humans, as all the mutations contained within the S protein are of the same type.
A basic study that found 99 percent genetic similarity between the coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 in plaques suggests that the long-lipped, ant-eating mammalian plaques, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, could be potential intermediate hosts for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, researchers in Guangzhou, China, said.
However, the 1% difference in distribution between the two organisms is still a significant difference, and we are awaiting final analysis results for solid evidence (Figure 3).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a test tube for up to 5 days in a dry environment for up to 48 hours at temperatures below 20 °C and at 40% to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 is not resistant to ultraviolet radiation and 30 minutes of heating at 56°C. Ethers, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing antibiotics, acetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solutions can kill the virus, whereas chloroxide does not.
In general, all humans lack immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore are not immune to the novel virus.
At present, no detailed observations on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been published.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
Generally, after a virus invades a host, the host's native immune system first recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus causes inflammation and develops dendritic (immune) cells, as well as limiting viral spread, and phagocyte cells produce type I interferons (IFNs) that accelerate the digestion of the virus's antibodies.
However, the N protein of the SARS-CoV virus may help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is playing a role in the fight against the virus.
T white blood cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in HIV prevention.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that fight the virus, while CD8+T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce an inflammatory cytokine to help the cells defend themselves.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by causing T cell death.
The body's immune system, which is also resistant to infections in the blood, is also essential to fight the virus, including supplements such as C3a, C5a and antibodies.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovering patients destroyed MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system releases a high concentration of free radicals, which can severely damage the lungs and internal organs, and in the most severe cases, can cause multiple organ damage and even death.
In the form of mass-infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect pregnant women and older adults with comorbidities.
People who are normally exposed to large numbers of viruses or have a weakened immune system are more likely to be infected than others.
A study of 425 infected people in Wuhan estimated the average SARS-CoV-2 onset time to be between 1 and 14 days, with most cases occurring within 3 to 7 days.
However, one study of 1,099 patients found that the average duration of onset was 3 days and the duration of possible onset was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on 8,866 cases of infection showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the duration of effective quarantine depending on the exact time of the outbreak, or prevent the spread of the virus from people who are infected to others without showing symptoms.
A standard practice requires that anyone who has been in contact with or has been infected with the virus be quarantined for 14 days.
The government has also been trying to get rid of the government's illegal immigration policy, which has been a source of concern for the country's citizens.
Usually, the main symptom of COVID-19 in the early stages is sickness, but it can also be accompanied by other symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headache, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced shortness of breath and/or lack of oxygen in the blood and lungs within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop rapidly with severe respiratory symptoms, blood poisoning, acid reflux in the digestive system, and bleeding.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and patients with severe illness should be tested early for viral infection, even if pulmonary imaging abnormalities are not observed.
A local diagnostic study conducted around late December 2019 reported that the percentage of symptomatic manifestations was 98% sickness, 76% coughing, 55% shortness of breath and 3% vomiting, and 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Two recent studies of a family and a group of people who had been infected by an asymptomatic person also found similar conditions.
In comparison, a population study conducted in 2012 also reported sickness (98%), coughing (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as their primary symptoms in MERS-CoV patients.
However, 80% of them require respiratory support, which is much more than the number of COVID-19 patients, which is roughly equivalent to MERS, which is more life-threatening than COVID-19.
Snoring (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, nausea (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), shortness of breath (40% to 42%), vomiting (20 to 25%) and sore throat (13 to 25%) are the main symptoms, and respiratory aids are required in nearly 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, with 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
By comparison, in November 2002, deaths from SARS were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, a population study conducted in June 2012 showed 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases of death.
According to an earlier study, the R0 (average infection rate) of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 (average infection rate) of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality and R0 (average infection rate) is shown in Table 1.1.
According to the above statistics, SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has a lower mortality rate than the latter two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Mass transmission is common within the same family or through the same social gathering or transportation such as a pleasure cruise.
The cases are those who have a history of travel or residents of Wuhan or other areas of infection within two weeks before the onset of symptoms, or who have been in contact with infected or sick individuals.
However, people have been known to carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms and patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital may carry the virus again, and the travel ban will be extended.
In the early stages, patients' white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes) tend to be normal or decreased.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, subnormal low lymphocyte count, including lymphocytes below 1×109/L, and lymphocytes below 4×109/L, and elevated levels of the aspartic aminotransferase enzyme, and the presence of the virus in the blood, were observed.
Some patients have elevated levels of red blood cells (myoglobin) and liver and muscle enzymes in the blood, and most patients have elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell saturation.
In patients with severe infections, the levels of D-dimer, a type of fibrin metabolite, in the blood rise and the number of white blood cells in the blood gradually decreases.
The majority of COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in their chest X-rays, with the main symptoms being shadows or glass-like light-colored patches on both sides of the lungs.
Patients are more likely to experience abnormal pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, it causes uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and the growth of connective tissue, which greatly impairs the gas exchange process.
The inactivation of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the level of surface tension, increasing surface tension, reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and can cause rapid lung damage.
Therefore, the worst thoracic scans tend to be the most severe.
A first-time diagnostic study of a patient who died from infection with COVID-19 on February 18, 2020, found significantly different levels of pneumocytes in the lungs, cleavage of choline membranes, leukaemia between blood vessel tissues, and cell tumors in the lungs. It is consistent with viral infectious pathology, ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The primary standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the use of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection process through the combination of complementary DNA-forming enzyme and polymerase enzyme-linked reaction (RT-PCR) from RNA samples.
However, the high rate of false positives may have accelerated the pandemic, and the use of medical technologies for diagnostic testing (no longer relying on single-sample RT-PCR) began in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation has occurred with the SARS test.
Therefore, a combined study including a history, clinical findings, laboratory tests and X-ray findings is essential and extremely important for the delivery of an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described a methodology to detect SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR technology-based SHERLOCK methodology, which allows for the detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in amounts from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter added) using a dipstick dipped in liquid in less than an hour without the need for extensive use of measuring instruments.
The hope is that if it is validated in clinical trials, the new technique will significantly improve responsiveness and convenience.
Because no novel coronavirus has been identified, many doctors can provide primary care to COVID-19 patients while simultaneously testing various therapies that have been previously used or proposed to treat other coronavirus diseases, such as SARS-CoV virus, MERS-CoV virus and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
The treatments include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine treatments, and psychological support.
The treatment of patients who recovered was also suggested using plasma.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibiotics and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs, but also attacks other organs that express the ACE2 enzyme, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, in moderate amounts.
However, respiratory disorders and decline are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore important for relieving symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, increased oxygen circulation, non-intramuscular inhaler/exhaler and intramuscular mechanical assisted inhaler/exhaler, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory syndrome are provided with pulmonary assisted extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technique used in the treatment of life-threatening heart disease and respiratory failure to interrupt the function of the modified heart and lungs and to circulate blood and oxygenate it with the help of an external machine.
In addition, protecting the function of vital organs and maintaining electromagnetic balance is important for SARS-CoV-2 patients to prevent and treat secondary infections and blood poisoning.
Cytokine storm is known to be a result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytoplasmic hyperdecomposition of the cell is a form of systematic inflammatory response caused by cytoplasmic degradation processes including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytoplasmic breakdowns in cells encourage immune cells to produce large amounts of free radicals, which are the main causes of ARDS and other organ damage.
In the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients, suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids, tussilicam and anti-IL6 monocholine antibodies have been used to treat cytokine hypertension.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm (cytokine overproduction) include direct T cell immune response modulation, inhibition of IFN- γ, IL-1 and TNF, JAK enzyme gene inhibition, cytokine cell signaling 4-stage suppression control, and HDAC inhibitor drugs.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation.
However, high doses of steroids have not been effective in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause severe side effects, especially bone tissue death, which significantly impacts diagnostic prognosis.
However, it is recommended that the use of cortisone in small doses and moderately frequent doses is recommended for severely ill COVID-19 patients.
No effective antibiotic therapy has been approved yet.
However, injecting a nucleotide analog, remdesivir, into the bloodstream was found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug that was originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Remdesivir was later shown to inhibit other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these facts, Gilead has provided the compound to China for conducting combined tests on SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and is very much looking forward to the results.
In addition, baritsinib, interferon-alpha, leptinvar/ritonavar, and ribavirin have been considered as potential therapies for patients with current respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after treatment with the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interactions between these treatments and other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
The production of plasma and immune antibodies from recovering patients
The use of plasma samples from patients recovering from infection to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent infection of a person who has not yet been infected has been done in the past.
In the case of genuine patients who recover, the level of antibodies in their blood is often extremely high.
Immunostimulatory antibodies are immune proteins produced by B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, to fight off pathogens and other foreign invaders, and they recognize and directly metabolize different molecules from pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from recovering patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved with decreased inflammation, decreased virus count and increased oxygen saturation in the blood within 24 hours.
However, the widespread use of the method before specific therapies are developed requires validation and clarification of the proposal to make it understandable.
In addition, some of the side effects associated with plasma should be carefully considered, as described in the treatment results.
For example, antibodies highly stimulate the immune response and therefore trigger the cytokine-releasing syndrome, which can be toxic to a life-threatening degree.
The levels of antibodies in the blood are usually low and large amounts of plasma are needed to treat patients with severe liver disease.
The difficulty is to develop and produce specific antibiotics quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate the cells from recovering patients and to screen for effective antibodies to fight the essential proteins of the virus, or to identify the genetic codes that produce effective antibodies.
This way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in Chinese medicine for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effects depend on the combination of different ingredients that will be involved in a drug regimen, which will vary depending on the diagnosis of a disease, based on the principles of TCM.
Most of the most effective components are still unknown, or there is so little precision that it is difficult to isolate and validate such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, and TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe cases.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), where 87% of their patients were treated with TCM, while the lowest recovery rate (13%) was observed in Hubei, where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients were treated with TCM.
However, this is only a rough comparison, as the assessment needs to take into account many other factors that can affect the number of patients and the severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) isolation treatment with WM and TCM combination treatment.
The time required to restore body temperature, recover from symptoms, and be hospitalized was found to be significantly shorter in the combination WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most encouragingly, the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% and 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% and 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await larger, systematically controlled clinical trials in more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the unique physical characteristics of the mechanism of action and to clearly identify the effective components of TCM treatments or, if possible, its combined uses.
People with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases often experience severe panic over the infectious and life-threatening disease, and those with restricted travel experience depression, loneliness and anger.
In addition to infectious symptoms such as fever, low blood oxygen and cough, side effects of treatment such as cortisol-induced insomnia can contribute to anxiety and emotional stress.
In the early stages of SARS infection, various psychiatric episodes have been reported, including frequent depression, anxiety, hyper-panic, hyperactivity, autism, delusions, and attempted suicide.
Tracking contacts and restricting travel and quarantining procedures that are not necessary as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak can be blamed on the self for increasing public concern, infecting their families and friends, isolating them and humiliating them.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, those who have been in contact with them, as well as the general public who need help.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multi-sectoral mental health teams, regular and transparent communication of accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment programs, and the use of high-tech electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to cutting the path of infection from animals and humans with pathogens to susceptible recipients where pathogens thrive, and are just as important as antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop an S protein-based vaccine to produce long-acting antibiotics and/or immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines that have been modified for the virus have been tested in animals for SARS.
However, until clinical research is initiated, it is not possible to determine the efficacy of these proposed vaccines in older and life-threatening experimental animals and whether they prevent animal-to-human transmission of the virus.
This is also possible, as SARS has been gone for over 17 years and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, occasional outbreaks and mass outbreaks of MERS have continued in the Middle East, and the continued outbreaks of animal-to-human transmission in the affected areas have led to the spread of the disease to other regions.
The MERS vaccination strategy was implemented using vaccines containing inactivated viruses, DNA plasm, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits (vaccines synthesized using specific protein antibodies) and some vaccines tested in animals.
Developing a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people without immunity is an urgent and critical task in controlling the current pandemic.
However, there are challenges in overcoming the difficulty due to the long time needed for the development of vaccines and the various variations of CoVs (average 18 months).
As a new disease, COVID-19 only began to show its full pathway of transmission after infecting thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without developing any further illness.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in patients with severe infections.
Therefore, health care agencies need to develop a predictive model of disease outcomes to prioritize treatment, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies to date, the following factors have an impact or link to the risk of disease in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in assessing the status of SARS, and it is also true for COVID-19.
As mentioned above, a study of 8,866 patients showed that COVID-19 primarily infects people aged 30-65, with those over 50 accounting for 47.7% of the cases.
Patients requiring intensive care are generally in poor health, and subsequent illnesses are significantly more common in older people (average age 51 years compared to 66 years). Age is recommended as a factor when predicting outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more commonly infected in men than women (0.31/100,000 and 0.27/100,000 respectively) as described above.
Conditions of outbreak and subsequent episodes: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart attacks and heart failure.
Heart-related diseases are also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2-associated cholangiocytes and has been reported to cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and immunity are not only interrelated, but can interact with each other.
Abnormal diagnostic findings - The CRP in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictor for disease status, response to therapy, and eventual recovery.
A correlation between the severity of COVID-19, the status of the disease and the CRP score has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely distributed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are produced during tissue damage.
They are therefore common symptoms of liver or kidney failure.
Key Symptoms: To assess the consequences of COVID-19 and the emergence of new diseases, a chest X-ray and the timing of the progression of symptoms should be considered, among other issues.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs that are often used as a complementary therapy to reduce severe inflammatory pain in infectious diseases.
Because high doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered avascular osteonecrosis, resulting in lifelong disability and impaired health.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid administration should be limited to a short-term low dose for COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, most patients experienced more stress than usual due to prolonged travel restrictions, as well as having to watch the death of close relatives and friends of patients, and the uncertainty of survival.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to help patients recover from stress and return to normal lives.
So far, population studies in different provinces and regions have suggested that COVID-19 has different epidemiological symptoms from SARS.
In addition to penetrating the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also effectively penetrate the upper respiratory tract, becoming infected like other common cold-causing CoVs, causing mild symptoms or no symptoms at an early stage.
Therefore, infection control is very difficult as infected patients can spread large amounts of the virus during their early stages or during the outbreak period, while traveling daily.
However, SARS-CoV infection is thought to occur when patients are severely ill and there is no early onset of infection.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
China is currently implementing excellent measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including the lockdown of Wuhan and its surrounding cities and continued travel restrictions involving almost all communities.
While these measures have significantly impacted the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end in March, and the recovery phase will last for 3-4 months.
But some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others predict that COVID-19, which is more infectious than SARS, may not be over by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported SARS-CoV-2 in the middle of the airway and in the throat of patients who had recovered and been hospitalized for less than two weeks, suggesting that the new virus is as seasonally replicated as influenza.
However, there are good signs of a decline in the number of new infections in China, and the strategic measures underway are showing effectiveness.
The number of Ebola cases could reach one million, and half of those could die, according to initial estimates.
However, the disease can be controlled gradually by implementing strict travel restrictions and quarantines.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may become less infectious like SARS-CoV and eventually die out or become a less co-existent virus in humans.
The following is a comparison of the prevalence of COVID-19 and SARS and MERS (Figure 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible through coughing or sneezing and can also be transmitted through direct contact with objects to which the virus is attached.
The virus is also found in feces, creating a new possibility of infection through feces and hands to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 infections, including 17 other cases and 40 health care providers, found that 41% of infections may have been transmitted in hospitals.
Therefore, effective preventive protection should be used to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even patients or those who have been in contact with infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks. The use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860) can help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks can prevent airborne transmission of fluid particles from a potential infected person to another person, and prevent them from sticking to surfaces and objects.
However, only N95 (series #1860) masks protect against viral particles that are small from 10 nanometers to 80 nanometers, and only 5% of viral particles are infectious. SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, with both viruses measuring approximately 85 nanometers.
The particles can rupture even five surgical masks that are bonded together, so healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series #1860) masks instead of surgical masks.
Healthcare providers should wear appropriate protective clothing in addition to masks to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted to a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask. The virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear transparent masks or glasses when dealing with patients.
The public in areas of infection or risk are strongly advised to wash their hands frequently with disinfectant, stay indoors, limit self-migration and isolation, and limit contact with people who may be infected.
In humans, keeping three feet away from a patient is considered a reasonable distance.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is arriving as a new virus to the world, the report of 7 January 2020 states that it is highly compatible with SARS-CoV and that China is in a state of emergency, a deeply recalling event of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020, Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reassured the public that the novel virus is not contagious and there are restrictions on human-to-human transmission, so there are no difficulties in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message has significantly dampened public awareness, especially as the country prepares for the Spring Festival, and this crucial moment has been missed to keep the disease at a minimum in Wuhan.
The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will learn from this difficult lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful in making public statements to make the public aware that every word matters and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) respond more carefully to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official statements from doctors or officials; (3) be more careful in controlling a potential epidemic from the earliest stages rather than trying to reassure the public; (4) publish more frequently and regularly the effective practices that have been put in place to make the public more aware of epidemics, and the public response system should be checked.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, as I write this, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
The virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are similar, making the COVID-19 outbreak feel like a re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to control the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 is more prevalent in older adults than in younger people, in men than in women, and has a higher incidence and mortality rate among older adults than younger people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% and 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus from themselves even if they do not show symptoms. In SARS, patients are usually infected when they are seriously ill. Therefore, the spread of COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread more rapidly and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 is not detectable by standard RNA testing.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered from the virus can be re-infected.
These findings significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With such a rapid increase in COVID-19 research, critical issues still need to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
While a 96% genetic similarity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and the two bat-borne SARS-CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
The virus has spread to humans from bats, which are said to be the original hosts.
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread of the disease, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
While many molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also integrate with ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
The pandemic is not going to end anytime soon.
How does the virus mutate when it is transmitted from person to person?
Could it become a pandemic, disappear like SARS, or reappear normally like influenza?
It is essential, but it may take some time to get answers to the above question and many other questions.
But at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
The genetic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the evolution of both coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for decades.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause illness less severe than the common cold.
The widespread outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the way HCoV infections are described as devastating and life-threatening.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China at the end of 2019 has further fueled the spread of CoVs, which surprised us with its high transmissibility, but is less pathogenic compared to its cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is animal-to-human transmission, and understanding the animal origins of HCoVs will help us do better.
Most of the HCoVs that originally infected bats originated from non-pathogenic bats.
Receptors for some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying host animals is directly related to preventing human diseases.
Investigating the interaction of CoV-infection receptor in animals can also yield important insights into the incidence of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the knowledge about the seven existing HCoVs, with emphasis on not only their research record but also their animal origins and cross-species transmission.
It is important that we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genetic recombination.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is discussed in this topic.
In addition, the requirements for successful host-to-host transmissions and the implications of viral mutation on the severity of the disease are highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are a family of coronaviruses that comprise a group of protective co-inhibited single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses are crown-shaped in microscopic structure and have acquired the largest species of RNA viruses, called CoVs, at 26 to 32 kilobytes.
Structurally, CoVs are undifferentiated cells that have a similar structure.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the organic matter content is composed of two overlapping, bi-readable, double-sided, orphans (ORF1a and ORF1b), interpreted as pp1a and pp1ab duplicate polyproteins.
Polyproteins are responsible for the production of 16 structurally unrelated proteins, designated as nsp1 to 16.
The remaining part of the structure of ORFs, which contain organic matter, includes the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A large number of specific ancillary proteins are also encoded by different CoVs genes.
Based on the internal sequence of different proteins, the pathogens of CoVs are grouped into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV genus contains the most HCoVs, and further divided into four genera (A, B, C, D).
Genetic analysis evidence has shown that birds are the primary concentrations of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs, and bats and rodents act as the genetic sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs.
CoVs have been subject to a series of species restrictions for thousands of years, and some have become critical to human disease outbreaks.
To date, seven human-caused CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are the alpha-CoVs.
The other five viral diseases included HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 infections have mild symptoms that are typical of common cold and/or diarrhea.
Comparatively, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 have a high risk of viral transmission and cause severe respiratory tract infections with a high risk of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe pulmonary disease in many patients.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nose of a cold patient in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through extensive studies of both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 strains, which can cause limited symptoms.
Indeed, until the SARS outbreak, the hypothesis that HCoVs-related infections are generally harmless was widely accepted.
The SARS outbreak, which emerged in 2003, was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing an estimated 10% deaths.
A decade later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a series of epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula and a resulting isolation in the rest of the world.
The HCoV (2019-nCoV) that emerged in 2019, later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the primary cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
As the warning goes, the world is preparing for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Both of the seven zoonotic HCoVs are originally transmitted from bats, mice or pets.
Various evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from milkweed, where the viruses are well-compatible and show good genetic variation, but no pathogenicity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many enormous medical, scientific, social and psychological challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding natural history, including the drivers and limitations of trans-species evolution.
It may also serve to guide or support the detection of host animals, moderate and advanced infection of SARS-CoV-2, and other important interactions to prevent future infections.
In this review, we present the conclusions of the origin of animal-to-human transmission, hybrid transmission and HCoV transmission.
In particular, we have highlighted the common pattern of HCoVs with their parent viruses that may not cause disease in their natural hosts but cause disease after transmission to new hosts within species.
We have also re-analyzed the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs, which tend to increase in transmission as the incidence declines.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal-transmitted CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first HCoV-229E gene B814 was isolated from nasal secretions of common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated in infected animals including chickens, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV detection, arranged by year (Table 1) is provided for the purpose of providing comprehensive and informative information.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted for survival within WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of the common cold, including headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat, fever and cough, which are seen within 10 to 20% of infection.
After 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from tissue development and subsequent evolution in the mouse brain.
The test results for HCoV-OC43 infection with HCoV-229E are similar, and the symptoms of other respiratory tract infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus are not distinguishable.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally widespread and transmitted mainly in the winter during temperate climates.
The typical incubation time of the two viruses is less than a week, followed by two weeks of illness.
A human volunteer trial found a mild cold symptom in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
A few immunocompromised patients have developed severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as the original pneumonia, was the first well-documented HCoV-caused epidemic in human history, and the third HCoV to be identified.
The first case of SARS was traced back to the Chinese province of Guangdong in late 2002.
The SARS virus has spread to countries and continents around the world, causing 774 deaths and 8,096 cases.
Except for those with extremely high infection rates, it is estimated that approximately two new cases per patient may occur within 4 to 7 days of onset, with the peak of viral infection estimated to be around 10 days after infection.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV show respiratory symptoms after the onset of muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness of breath and cough.
Low lymphocyte count, complications from liver function tests, and increased enzyme metabolism are common laboratory-acquired complications of SARS.
Widespread damage to the lining of the lungs, the proliferation of epithelial cells and the proliferation of macrophages have also been observed in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients require inpatient care and mechanical respiratory aids as an additional option.
It can infect not only the lower respiratory tract but also various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, and is often accompanied by a severe cell mutation process called a cytokine storm, which can be fatal in patients with severe disease, especially those with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from a lung tissue test of the patient, who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, there have been remarkable efforts in the HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to spread among young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of HCoV-NL63 include mucus, cataracts, fever, and pneumonia.
Another independent study reported the isolation of a similar virus from the nasal cavity of an eight-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
It was first identified in the Netherlands, but has spread globally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of respiratory illnesses, with peak periods occurring during the summer, spring, and early fall.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a form of throat infection known as a throat ulcer.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old patient hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma epidemic exacerbation.
HCoV-HKU1, which is similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, has been identified worldwide as causing mild respiratory illness.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are genetically susceptible to human-compatibility and generally more virulent disease, but in a rare case of accidental infection with a highly contagious and highly pathogenic HCoV-NL63 variant that can severely affect the lower respiratory tract in China, the cause is still unknown.
In general, these HCoVs are less severe or pathogenic when they become more efficient in transmitting and continuing to be present in humans.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia who had symptoms of pneumonia and kidney failure.
The majority of laboratory-confirmed infections originated in the Middle East, and cases of infection from other sources, sometimes evolving through close contact, have been reported in several European countries and in Tunisia.
Another outbreak of the virus was in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The actual description of MERS, which is similar to SARS, describes the advanced symptoms as severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, severe renal failure has also occurred in many patients infected with MERS, which has isolated MERS from HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of infected patients show symptoms of gastroenteritis such as nausea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there have been over 2,500 confirmed laboratory tests of infections with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most virulent viruses known to mankind.
A review of the association with SARS-CoV-2 infection found that groups of known pneumonia cases were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, between mid-December and late December 2019.
The World Health Organization has declared the recent outbreak of respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern, also known as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a 3.4% severe death rate.
In Hubei, China, the death rate is 4.2%, compared to 1.2% in the rest of the country.
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are characterized by severe respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which show symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients have been diagnosed with diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can escalate into a severe respiratory syndrome.
However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly similar due to the high genetic content of 82% of organisms, and they are sub-grouped into different sub-organisms.
SARS-CoV-2 is significantly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more transmissible.
There have also been cases of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease worldwide.
The similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the six other emerging HCoVs are very interesting.
The HCoVs are highly similar in appearance during the initial incubation period and during the infection period.
According to this, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19's symptoms lies between SARS-CoV and the four most common HCoVs in the population (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections have been showing the same symptoms as those seen in human HCoV infections, including episodes with no or mild or asymptomatic symptoms.
In other words, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 are also found in SARS-CoV cases, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, it also reveals interesting patterns in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in both socially transmitted HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, the infectious capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as HCoVs in humans.
In other words, it remains to be seen whether the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased after human infections, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in waste samples, just like HCoVs.
Future studies are needed to clarify whether or not oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in SARS-CoV infection.
It is particularly interesting whether or not the weather-specific SARS-CoV-2 is as visible as other HCoVs from social movement.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its potential for spread, pathogenesis and contained spread after human outbreak will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have mild symptoms and are well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it is also possible that humans are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be residual diseases of previous pandemics of HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe infection in humans and people who have been severely infected with HCoVs have rarely been removed.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate within humans to allow sufficient time for adaptation to mutate against host-restricted agents.
In this context, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the more people will be infected and the greater the chance of adaptation to the living.
Once it is well established, it will be difficult to stop infections in living humans with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For years, community-acquired CoVs have been prevalent among humans, causing colds in people with normal immunity.
These viruses do not need to be host animals.
In comparison, the high incidence SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well-compatible in humans and cannot prevent their transmission to humans.
They need to be contained and spread within the host animals and seek out access to immunocompromised humans through one or more intermediate and host-expansion hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar physical characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs that are known to occur in humans.
It is as prevalent as the four HCoVs currently present in humans.
However, it is more transmissible than HCoVs that are socially transmitted and less transmissible than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is fully adapted to humans and continues to spread from person to person without a pathogen or intermediate animal pathogen.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, we discuss the evolutionary pathology, nature, pathogenesis, intermediate and expansional implications and specificities of HCoVs.
An animal that has inherited a closest related ancestor that shares a high degree of similarity at the level of genetic sequence acts as a genetic evolution of a particular HCoV.
The primitive virus usually adapts well and there is no infection in this host.
A host with the same pathogenic stock has been a long-term carrier of HCoVs.
In both cases, the recipients were naturally infected and were either the natural source of HCoVs or their source viruses.
In contrast, if HCoVs start as a medium-level host before reaching humans, they may become infected in general without adapting well to the new host.
This receptor not only serves as a zoonotic source of human-to-human transmission, but also acts as a highly transmissible host that can increase the rate of human-to-human transmission by temporarily replicating the virus and transmitting it to humans.
If the HCoV fails to control its spread to the host, it can cause a hopeless infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can survive in the host and cause long-term outbreaks.
In this case, moderate tolerance becomes natural tolerance.
According to epidemiological and prevention data, historical records of contact with wild animals were recorded during the first SARS outbreak.
Subsequent investigations into the pathogenesis of the outbreak by blood tests have indicated that animal traders have the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV antibody (SARS-CoV IgG) compared to the general population.
Cat larvae (Paguma larvata) and raccoons in live animal markets were first identified as carriers of the SARS-CoV-like virus.
The spread of SARS infection after killing all the cats in the markets is indirectly supporting the fact that no further outbreaks occur.
However, it has been shown that cat octopuses in the wild or on farms are not susceptible to SARS-CoV infection without contact with live animals, and cat octopuses may function as intermediate-level pathogenic receptors of SARS-CoV rather than a natural receptor.
The fact that different animals, especially in Guangzhou markets, have 80% antibodies against SARS-CoV, and that different species of small mammals are potentially receptors of SARS-CoV directly, cannot be ignored.
These all appear to be the latest hosts of SARS-CoV.
A follow-up study on the zoonotic susceptibility of SARS-CoV revealed a close association between bat CoV and SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) in Chinese cow's milk.
These chickens have antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV and also share the same genetic sequence as SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
It and other bat CoVs share a similarity of 88-92% in the sequence of the genome-based cells of SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the groundwork for the new hypothesis that bats are host animals that carry pathogens that can cause disease in humans.
Several SARS strains, such as CoVs (SL-CoVs), have also been identified as originating in bats, but have not been isolated as a live virus except for one identified WIV1.
Human hormone-constructed transcription enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 is derived from intestinal samples of bats and has been shown to be useful in using bats, cat's yeast and human ACE2 as receptors for intracellular infection.
Interestingly, the serum of patients with SARS was able to reduce the degradation of WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has been shown to be the closest association with SARS-CoV in bats, where 95% of the genetic-based cell sequence is the same.
Although there is a high degree of genetic similarity between the two viruses, it is generally accepted that bats are not the direct host of SARS-CoV, nor is WIV1 the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic biology suggests that the MERS-CoV strains share a common genus with the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 strains.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV are transmitted via the same receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme effects of MERS-CoV are closely related to those of the beta-CoVs in milk protein identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% of the same genetic cell sequence.
Therefore, bats are not likely to be a direct transmitter of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, in the Middle East, the findings suggest that one-legged camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV-focused antibody deficiency, similar to camels of Middle Eastern origin in various African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal cavities of a camel, and further demonstrated that camels function as true disease-acquiring receptors of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels infected with MERS-CoV, as tested, generally have mild symptoms but a high risk of transmission of the virus.
Infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the gastrointestinal tract, the main route for bat viruses.
However, questions remain about whether there is a reasonable human-to-human transmission or an anonymous transmission involving an unidentified animal species that has been infected with MERS-CoV, as MERS infections have no history of exposure to camels prior to the severe outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% biochemical bioavailability with the Rhinolophus affinis bat-identified CoV RaTG13.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very good for determining the relationship to the origin.
Unless near-identical bat CoVs are detected in the future, it is unlikely that bats are related host hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
The hypothesis is that the moderate animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may exist between the slaughter of wild animal species in the Huangnan seafood retail market and the presence of early infections and animal-to-human transmission events associated with COVID-19.
Several recent studies based on genetic analysis have suggested that a small group of mammals known as potentially dangerous plaques (Manis javanica) may also host source beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This new disc CoV gene has 85-92% in common with SARS-CoV-2 during cell division.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 at the level of gene-based cell arrangement, with about 90% of the specificity.
They are grouped into two subfamilies of SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses in the evolutionary tree, one of which is more similar to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) containing SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence specificity.
The significant difference is that the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more diverse, but have a high degree of cross-genetic sequence similarity.
A preliminary study of infected discs suggested that removing the viral overlap from lung samples translates to a case similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study is a way of combining different data sources and stands in the way of attempting to cure human lesions to produce a partial biochemical effect of about 86.3% of the virus's end-genome.
Screwplate also does not rule out the possibility of an intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present, the difference in follow-up results between SARS-CoV-2 and platelet-derived SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs has not been shown to be a direct derivative of the platelet-derived virus of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2, which are related to beta-CoVs.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in bats, scorpions and other mammals is needed.
The highest sequence similarity was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and platelets, while SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, shared the highest sequence similarity in the genome.
There is a growing speculation that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the platelet SARS-CoV-2 and the association of beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective-resolution evolution.
The counterargument calls for a mutation between the platelet-associated beta-CoV SARS-CoV-2 and the tertiary wildlife species RaTG13.
Mutation synthesis as a driving force in evolution is prevalent among beta-CoVs.
The determination remains on the direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the HCoVs, which are highly pathogenic to the virus, the zoonotic source of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is being studied.
Genetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the original source viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in animals that were susceptible to the disease.
The CoV, named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), was reportedly detected in North American triple-celled milk, which has been shown to be similar to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was investigated in Ghana, and camels are considered to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge on the animal origin of HCoVs, known as HCoVs, is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Biomimetic analyses have shown evidence of historical transmission between variants of HCoVs.
A respiratory infection epidemic was recorded around 1890 when HCoV-OC43 crossed species and passed from domestic animals to humans.
The history of transmissions between species of HCoV-229E is unclear.
Bat alpha-CoVs, which are most closely related to HCoV-229E, have been identified.
Among them is the alpha-CoV, which is found in a coarse animal of the camel genus.
There is evidence of direct transmission from bats to humans.
The first contact with bats was probably made by humans, not by alpine rhinos, within the shared ecosystem.
Instead, humans have been in close contact with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-associated bat alpha-CoVs are differentiated in bats and are not pathogenic, whereas the alpaca viruses alpha-CoVs cause respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV, which is found in a camel-haired animal, is not found in wild animals.
This does not rule out the possibility that a camel-haired animal could transmit the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV to humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that can infect humans, including rabies, Ebola, Ne-P-Virus, and the smallpox virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can directly infect humans with HCoV-229E.
In other words, alpha-CoVs actually act as a genome for HCoV-229E, a hairy animal of the genus Camel, and camels specifically act as a medium-stage host of infection from viruses to humans, as during MERS-CoV infections.
MERS-CoV is one of the best examples of transmission between species, from bats to one-horned camels, but also from one-horned camels to humans.
The evolutionary MERS-CoV from bats was identified as an early identifier and has been strengthened in subsequent studies.
Bats are known to transmit a wide variety of viruses, which are essential for the exchange of genome fragments between species and for interspecies transmission.
Longevity, close colonial groups, close colonial relationships, and strong flight capabilities are all factors that make bats a preferred vector of the virus.
In other words, MERS-CoV has been present in the intestines of a single-celled organism for decades.
The evolution of the direct pathway to a stable, naturally occurring pathway is well suited to the situation of camels.
MERS-CoV has been controlled to cause very mild disease in these animals and to slow the rate of mutation.
Its rare transmission to humans is accidental, and as the virus is not transmitted, humans remain the host of MERS-CoVs that cannot be transmitted to other hosts.
If anything, the role of camels in the MERS-CoV outbreak and that of ticks in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are different.
Platelet beta-CoVs, in particular, are associated with high infection rates in platelets.
They are likely end-range receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and similarly related beta-CoVs, such as cat leprosy.
The different possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered for inclusion in future trials and whether to be excluded.
First, bats may be a potential host for SARS-CoV-2, a virus that is almost identifiable as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share the environment with bats through killing of bats or mining for coal.
Second, the discs may be the receptor for the mediator that initiated the SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
People are infected with the virus through the killing and sale of meat from predators.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The study also found that the number of animals that are infected with the virus is higher than the number of animals that are infected with the virus.
Third, the re-integration and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 as described above may occur in the third species, which is exposed to both bats and ticks.
Research on the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to various animal hosts, three key roles for the virus are important in facilitating the crossing of species barriers by CoVs.
First, they are relatively highly mutable during RNA replication.
Compared to single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoVs is defined as a moderate to high average rate of substitution, with a replacement rate of ~10-4 per 2 sites per year, depending on the consistent pattern of novel CoV receptors.
CoVs contain an exoribonuclase enzyme that reads and modifies, and inhibition of this enzyme can lead to extremely high mutations, leading to thinning or even survival.
Remdesivir, an interesting nucleoprotectant, is known to suppress the CoV homologue through restriction of this isotretinoin and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising experimental drugs against SARS-CoV-2.
However, the rate of mutation of the CoVs is about one million times higher than that of their hosts.
In addition, when the CoVs do not adapt well to the carrier, the mutation rate is often high.
Compared to the high-mutation rate SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower mutation rate and a higher degree of homology in humans.
The theory suggests that it has already been transmitted to other hosts that are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also related to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the larvae of the one-clawed frog.
In theory, genetic mutation cannot quickly cause ineffectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs.
Second, the large RNA genome within the CoVs makes it more adaptable during the genetic modification for mutations and recombinations, thereby increasing the likelihood of co-evolution between species, which in turn allows for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions are right.
It is supported by a variety of open reading frames and protein processes that encode the 3' end of the chromosome set.
Third, CoVs change shape at a rapid and frequent rate during RNA replication through a different transcript-selective pathway.
Fibro-neutralization occurs during CoV RNA transcription within a receptor that acts as a mixing vehicle.
The high availability of endosymbionts and the recombination of gene cell RNAs can lead to new CoV pathogens.
Evidence of evolutionary mutation of the natural combination has been found not only in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 but also in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The virus' host response associated with the spread
In addition to the above three factors related to the virus, the host's host and the interaction of the virus is another key factor influencing cross-species transmission.
In this context, recombination of SARS-CoV is identified as a typical example of evidence of selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on separate analyses of human and cat SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoVs may be rapidly adapted to different receptors, with specific mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, within the S protein of the CoV, RBD has a strong selective interaction with a receptor composed of cells and a response of immune antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is present at the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 segment, which is a co-pathogen receptor for human ACE2 as well as virus entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize various ACE2 receptors in animals, including bats, leopards, mice and rhinoceroses, that cause viral infection.
In fact, only six different amino acid residues from the human and cat leprosy virus have been isolated in RBD, and four of them are located in the ACE2 receptor and receptor for interaction.
Cat-acquired SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations within its RBD, which may enhance the ability of the human ACE2 receptor to interact with the spike protein.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be critical for disease adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar cellular receptor to SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV within the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that its S protein may have a change in affinity to human ACE2.
In fact, cryo-EM studies have indicated a 10 to 20 times higher rate of binding between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins than the rate of binding.
It is also interesting to determine whether another major outbreak site is needed for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also related to ACE2, but with a different component of S.
There are also several other HCoV pathogen storage sites, such as N amino peptides for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated cysteine for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be considered for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans following species-specific transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to the cell's pathogenic receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host-dependent factors and limitations.
Differences in protein receptors between humans and natural host sites of HCoVs, such as bats, camels and mice, may act as a barrier to infection.
HCoVs need to occupy host sites and disrupt restricted sites to achieve cross-infection.
In this context, there is still a need to identify the molecular components and identification of the epithelial characteristics of the critical virus-host interaction region.
The use of the highest-level CRISPR to determine receptor dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 during non-biased species-wide screening may be beneficial.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to the beginning
Variation of bat CoVs provides many opportunities for emergence of new HCoVs.
In this view, bat CoVs act as a gene pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic fusion also lead to HCoV evolution, and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, storage or loss of genes that code for a novel protein has the potential to greatly modify the appearance of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV sub-proteins, the SARS-CoV-associated bat viruses were found to be isolated but encoded for different ORF8 proteins, leading to the thought that ORF8 is important in human adaptation.
The 29-genome-decomposing features of SARS-CoVs were found in strains that were isolated early in human transmission.
This deletion can be seen as a corresponding mutation in ORF8 as a grouping of ORF8a and ORF8b and a pathogen storage receptor exchange.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha- and gamma-CoVs sequences with a large number of smaller recombinant domains isolated within RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzymes.
Re-combination sites can be identified within most nsp9, nsp10, and also within components of nsp14.
Similarly, the outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Saudi Arabian bushes shows that there have been cases of recombination between different strains.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, and the discovery suggests that HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in genes unrelated to their structure.
It should also be noted that unnatural selection can cause undesirable changes in the virus's genome, which can often be caused by forcing selections that affect the host's immune system, such as viruses.
An example of such effects is the loss of the entire ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototypical gene, which causes the destruction of two nucleotides.
While undamaged ORF4 has been detected in HCoV-229E-associated bat and camel viruses, alpha-CoVs of the alpha-compact camel show a single-cell insertion that causes boundary migration.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure within their host sites.
When infected with CoVs in bats, no or mild symptoms have been identified that suggest interaction between CoVs and bats.
It showed that bats adapt well to both body parts and CoVs.
For example, in bats, defects in stimulation of the inflammatory response effectively reduce the incidence of viral infections caused by CoVs.
In addition, the killer cell function in bats is suppressed due to increased NKG2/CD94 receptor sites against the killer cell and low levels of expression of stem cell homology group I molecules.
Furthermore, high-receptor oxygen species (ROS) are produced by the biomaterial activity of bats, which suppresses CoV replication and affects both repair by the enzyme exoribonuclease, thus selectively pressuring for the production of high-pathogenic virus variants when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV variants can also evolve by recombination, leading to the storage of novel proteins or protein shapes for adaptation to the host.
So the emergence of new HCoVs in the last two decades is not accidental.
CoVs are either asymptomatic or mildly pathogenic in their storage host such as bats and camels.
They replicate aggressively without extracting the immune response of a stronger host.
The secret here is how carriers can cause severe infections in unsymptomatic humans.
Severe symptoms are caused by an overreaction of the immune response and severe respiratory symptoms, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, there is a difference between the immune response from replication of the CoV in the absence of signs of transmission.
Immunological response interruption, a similar strategy that affects the SARS-CoV-2 immunotherapy, may also be beneficial.
The immune response to disease is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, feeding type I interferon may be beneficial, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Furthermore, the NLRP3 explosive response in bats is not perfect.
For this reason, the MCC950 and NLRP3 restrictions may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is followed by a similar general pattern to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
In fact, bat beta-CoV has 95% shared biochemical life with SARS-CoV, and bat beta-CoV has 96% shared biochemical life with SARS-CoV-2.
In fact, cat cat and other commercially available animals have been found to host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, and no direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Platelet beta-CoVs have been found to be significantly similar in genome to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that platelets may act as an intermediate host or that platelet beta-CoVs may contribute a gene fragment to the final form of SARS-CoV-2.
Questions remain, but there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally made by humans.
The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has led to a resurgence of CoVs.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have effectively changed our understanding of the importance of animals in the transmission of infections from animal sources and HCoVs in human infection.
There is widespread evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and spread to humans through moderate outbreaks.
If SARS-CoV infection is thought to have been caused by contact between humans and cat caterpillars in markets, closing markets for live fish and killing caterpillars may have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the detection of beta-CoVs within the genus of ticks closely related to SARS-CoV-2 should remove ticks from wholesale markets to prevent transmission of the disease through animals.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via platelets and other mammals and how it is transmitted remains to be clarified in further studies.
In other words, MERS-CoV has been present in the larvae of the one-pot mushroom for a long time.
These camels serve as a major tourist attraction as well as a major source of meat, milk, dairy and spices for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is not possible to release all camels to control MERS as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach to the development and effective production of a MERS-CoV vaccine for camels, in combination with other infection control measures, is needed to stop the recurrence of MERS infections.
These viruses cannot be eradicated and new genes may be produced that spread the infection.
Different animal-infected CoVs circulate in the wild.
Bat CoVs, which are particularly susceptible to animal-to-human transmission, are diverse.
There is a high probability that these viruses will evolve and combine to produce new viruses that are more contagious and/or deadly in humans.
Some areas in China where wildlife eating culture is prevalent should be closed to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the difficult testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time on the planet.
They live in their native habitat until they are allowed to leave their bodies.
However, while bats have many features that encourage the spread of the virus, humans can reduce exposure to bats and other wildlife species by knowing how to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of living animals is essential to better understand the ecological link between CoVs and their natural pathogens, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human infections and future infections.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the spread of animal-borne infections is to stay away from natural pathogenic environments where humans can store viruses transmitted through animals.
Some pieces of the puzzle of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans remain blank.
First, it is interesting to see under what conditions bats and ticks share the same biological survival status if bats transmit the source virus of SARS-CoV-2 to ticks.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human infection, we should analyze how humans transmit from bats.
Third, if the third mammal is indeed an intermediate host, we need to clarify how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and ticks.
Finally, many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and should be monitored and tested for infection.
It is expected that in the future, they will be able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus within their natural host, if they are bats, scorpions or another mammal.
Subsequent investigations will clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases need to be upgraded.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a forward-looking guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which contains our experience and makes a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease and our awareness and understanding has been steadily improving based on current research findings and treatment practice experience, so methods for diagnosis and treatment are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines and describe the new diagnostic standard for suspected and confirmed patients according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), now officially named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
To help fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our team has written a guide to easy-to-know tips and published it online at the Army Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
Since its release, it has received a lot of attention.
It is important to note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience, our knowledge and understanding of the disease is steadily increasing, and thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continuously being upgraded.
Between January 16, 2020, and March 3, 2020, the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China's Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued a total of seven updates on certain aspects that are changing as the situation evolves.
Zhou et al., who introduced the traditional score proposal based on clinical experience, now commented on our guidelines.
Their efforts will add new evidence to our direction and will be a valuable reference in the fight against this global pandemic.
We acknowledge their outstanding work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh revision) and the study of the guidelines.
Under the seventh amendment (3 March 2020), if there is no clear epidemiological record to confirm a suspected case, a comprehensive diagnostic analysis requires either one of two epidemiological records consisting of two clinical simulations, or three clinical simulations:
Outbreak records: (1) travel or residence in Wuhan city or its vicinity, or other areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) exposure to Wuhan city or its vicinity in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; or (2) exposure to patients with sickness or other travel symptoms reported in Wuhan city or its vicinity; and (4) exposure to non-existing conditions (such as exposure to a child in a school or school setting or in a visiting environment).
Symptoms: (1) illness and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) symptoms in a X-ray of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells that indicate that the number of lymphocytes is normal, decreased or reduced in the early developmental stage.
Confirmed cases should be based on the presence of a suspected pathogen or plasma evidence as indicated by diagnostic testing: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, (2) a sequence of viral strains that indicate high variation in the detected novel coronavirus, (3) a plasma test for SARS-CoV-2 isolated IgM antibody and IgG antibody, a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody mutation, or a significant increase in recovery over the critical stage ≥4.
The second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the report included real-time PCR testing for the presence of nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples.
After the pathogen detection blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) revisions, plasma analysis evidence was added in the seventh revision.
These modifications provide a continuous work by researchers to identify the most suitable nucleic acid detector for rapid detection, as well as blood sampling to provide a good result based on specific antibody specifications based on respiratory samples that increase the availability of different samples.
In addition, there is growing evidence that warns us to be wary of patients with unique symptoms and those without symptoms.
Therefore, they should update the flow chart of Zhou et al. since they classify people without clinical symptoms as low-risk individuals.
The scoring system must also be validated by clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we would like to see more direct evidence and comments from readers.
We recommend that suspected and confirmed patients follow the latest guidance from their home countries for testing.
Our team will be updating our guidance in real time to help.
Bangladesh has reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily toll in the country.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of today, the number of recorded cases reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh includes 114 patients undergoing treatment and 33 recovered and residing at home.
The total number of deaths recorded is 17.
In an online news summary, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two patients were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an epidemic on March 11.
A hospital official told local news agency Anadolu Agency that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be closed for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
The lockdown on public transportation began on March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of basic goods, medicine, fuel and food is still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were two men and the wife of one of them who returned from Italy on March 8.
The three have been recovering since March 19.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide exceeded one million, data from Johns Hopkins University showed.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The day the first confirmed coronavirus infection in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia occurred on the same day, set a new record.
On Thursday, North Korea said it was one of the few countries free of coronavirus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 confirmed cases in the past 24 hours at 10am (UTC 0800) Central European Time on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, with at least 5,900 deaths.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 people died in the United States on Wednesday from coronavirus infections, CBS reports.
Around the world, countries have announced strict measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russian citizens will be paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for another 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the rest of the day, after previously imposing a curfew between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand is planning to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
The Australian government has lowered the one-time purchase limit for toilet paper in shops.
On Saturday and Sunday nights, Australia's Woolworths and Coles stores limited their supply of toilet paper to two packs and one pack at a time in all of their nationwide stores.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a restriction on the sale of one pack per person.
The restrictions are also posted on the checkout and on the Facebook pages of the supply lines as messages.
The company says that while the fear of COVID-19 has forced them to live in isolation, buyers are stockpiling supplies that may be needed.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper to one pack per order for home delivery.
The change follows the restrictions on selling only four packages per purchase that were introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
Coles reported in its March 8 news release that many stores that only sell four items per person are still selling out within an hour, and it used to call the demand "unprecedented", but in a Facebook post, ALDI called the demand "unexpected".
A spokesperson for Woolworths said that sales had risen sharply in the previous week.
The Kosco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two rolls last week.
To reduce inventory shortages, Coles ordered more and more supplies from manufacturing suppliers and increased shipments several times. Woolworths took supplies on the side and made sure that they were available early for the Wednesday special, also scheduled by ALDI.
Russell Zinnemann, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers wanted to increase their stock, but local authorities have limited the time for trucks to arrive, making it difficult.
He said that suppliers are trying to meet demand and that he hopes that the production costs will rise as fewer special cases are involved.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that some stores will not be able to hold the Wednesday special sale after early sales.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that grocery stores are replenishing their stores every night.
He commented that the lack of toilet paper was uncomfortable for people as toilet paper is a space-consuming material and only a small amount can be stored and when the sale is over, there is a large amount of space left on the stage.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if you have plenty of supplies on the stage, if you have access to products like toilet paper and detergents, and if you have a lot of them, you can minimize the risk", Russell Zimmer told ABC News.
The company, which sells recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, said on Wednesday that they were running out of supplies.
According to News.com.au, Kimball Clock, the maker of Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris, the maker of Sorben, are working hard 24 hours a day to maintain supply.
The real estate website Domain.com is the first to offer free toilet paper to buyers at auctions in Melbourne to extend the week-long holiday for Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of the Darwin daily newspaper NT contains eight sheets of paper intended to be cut for use as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's report on 3 March, the stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on shoppers.
Russell Zimmerman added that demand for other products, including masks, detergents, dryers, hand sanitizers and flour, was also rising.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Okedo on Sunday limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to 12 packages.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to be an epidemic.
The term pandemic refers only to the extent to which a disease has spread, and not to the severity of the outbreak, and the WHO has warned governments that they should:
The pandemic is still in the hands of every country.
If countries in response detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize people, says WHO Secretary General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the world's largest health organization, the WHO, will be able to do so.
"We are paying special attention to both the alert levels for spread and the alert levels for emergency and the alert levels for quiet".
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He told CNN in February that no other respiratory virus, other than influenza, has been detected in a continuous global emergency.
The report also highlighted the need for a new coronavirus pandemic, which is expected to be the first in the country to be linked to a pandemic.
"We have never seen a controlled epidemic", he added.
Following the emergence of a new global pandemic, the WHO decided to declare a public health emergency of global concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said that the baseline for infectious diseases is worse.
As of Thursday, AP reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is the ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and a public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020, and an epidemic was declared on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported from around 210 countries and territories, with an estimated 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The confirmed death rate is estimated to be around 4% in China, and globally, between 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Sequels may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between infection and symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment to kill the virus.
The main treatment is symptom-based treatment and supportive therapies. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth if coughing, keeping a distance from others, and self-isolation and monitoring if suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded by restricting travel, travel restrictions, curfews, workplace hazard control and closing down workplaces.
The pandemic has disrupted global socio-economics, causing postponements or cancellations of sporting, religious, political and cultural events. Shopping in panic has exacerbated the shortage of goods in many places.
Schools and universities are closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
The spread of misinformation about the virus on the internet has led to fear and discrimination against people of East and Southeast Asian descent and ethnicity, as well as Chinese, who live in areas where the virus is widespread.
The reduction of tourism and the closure of factories have led to a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported a mass detection of pneumonia from unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
Most cases were associated with the Hunan Strait retail market, and it was thought that the virus originated from an animal source.
The virus that causes the infection is SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered strain of the virus, closely related to bat coronavirus, scleroderma coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The patient who was first diagnosed with the disease later became ill on December 1, 2019.
Two-thirds of the early mass infections reported in December 2019 were market-related.
According to an unconfirmed report published in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020, tracing an outbreak back to 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province is the first case of infection.While new cases have been declining significantly in China, there has been a sudden surge in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China has surpassed the number of new infections in China for the first time, the WHO said on 26 February 2020.
The number of cases in the country is likely to be significantly reduced for those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, only a small number of cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of global cases.Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the UK population would achieve cohort immunity after infection.
People who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be infected according to official procedures are referred to as infected.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have official policies against testing people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections in China remained undetected as of January 23, and that the undetected infections were found to be the original sources of infection for 79% of the registered infections.
A review of the statistics released on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is much higher than the number of reported cases.
The original estimate of the basic generation number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the average duration of symptoms being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths has reached around 97,000.
In China, 80% of the deaths by February 5 were over 60 years old, and 75% had underlying health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have tested positive for COVID according to official procedures.
This may be due to the fact that the actual number of deaths from COVID-19 is higher, as it does not include those who died without medical treatment, such as in homes, nursing homes, etc.
Data from Italy, in part, shows that the number of deaths during the pandemic is four to five times higher than the actual deaths from COVID.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that we know the death toll was underestimated. Underestimates are being made in the United States, and uncertain reports confirm this statement. Such underestimates are common during pandemic times, such as during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
Outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each recorded more than a dozen deaths by February 28.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica had reported deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, duration of the initial infection, and age, gender, and overall condition. The ratio of deaths to cases is the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases over a given time period.
According to data from the Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-epidemic ratio as of April 10, 2020 was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The amount varies by region.
Estimates of the prevalence-to-mortality ratio in China fell from 17.3% (for those with symptoms within 10 days of January 1, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other estimates include the maximum mortality rate (CFR) for outbreaks, which indicates the percentage of those diagnosed with the disease who die from the disease, and the infectious-to-mortality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of those infected who die from the disease (whether diagnosed or not).
The figures are not data for a period of time, but data from spotting a group of people infected through a process that is considered to be infectious.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
Estimates from the Centre for Reference-Based Medicine at Oxford University suggest that the mortality risk for outbreaks is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest estimate for this scale is consistent with the findings of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and the analysis of the impact of the test on estimated mortality.
The WHO claims the pandemic is under control.
The peak and end times of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
The first is that the virus is not transmitted by the virus itself, but by the virus itself, which is transmitted by the virus itself.
However, it is almost impossible to predict when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said that if all countries joined together to implement the WHO recommendations on measures to contain the virus, the pandemic could end by June.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 could be spreading for a year or two.
The study, led by Neil Furguson of Imperial College, suggests social distancing and other measures until vaccination is available (possibly 18 months or longer).
William Schnaffer of the University of Windsor said that the coronavirus is unlikely to disappear completely due to the rapid spread of infection, and that it is likely to become a seasonal disease and will return every year.
The likelihood of re-infection depends on the immunity of the population and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not specific, and people who are infected may not show symptoms.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, mucous membrane discharge in the respiratory tract, loss of smell, shortness of breath, sore throat, musculoskeletal pain, headache, tremor, nausea, blood clots, vomiting, and vomiting. According to the WHO, one in six cases of the disease are known to become severely ill and have respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergencies as difficulty breathing, chest pain or feeling pressured, sudden dizziness, difficulty falling asleep, and ashes on the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some infected people have no symptoms but are diagnosed as positive patients when tested. The researchers therefore recommend that those who have had close contact with confirmed infected patients should be closely monitored and tested to rule out infection.
China estimates the number of asymptomatic cases to be between a few and 44 percent.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) is between one and 14 days, and usually symptoms appear within five days. One example that is not yet known is the estimated number of patients with COVID-19 who have lost smell and taste, which was initially 30% and later dropped to 15%.
The spread of the disease is still to be determined by some details.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted primarily by small particles of fluid released by close contact with coughing, sneezing or talking. Close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without a covering can produce particles of liquid that can reach 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some suggest that the virus may also be transmitted through speech-produced particulate matter, which can remain in the air for longer periods of time. Although respiratory particulate matter produced when breathing out while speaking may also be produced, the virus is not airborne in general.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nasal cavity of people nearby, or they can be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), cause leakage in the respiratory tract, allowing particles to enter the atmosphere and spread through the atmosphere.
It can also be spread when someone touches a surface that has been in contact, including the skin, after touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
There are serious concerns that the disease can be transmitted through feces, but it is believed that the risk of transmission is low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from one person's feces to another person's food.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although infection may occur before and in the later stages of the disease.
The diagnosis is made three days before the onset of symptoms, and the infection may be detected before any significant symptoms are present.
There have been few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic infections, but in some countries asymptomatic cases are detected during tracking tests of suspected infections.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has not yet clarified how easily the disease is spread, but it has been reported that one person typically infects two to three others.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to survive on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
The COVID-19 infection has been detected in pets and other animals.
While there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with areas where an infected person may have been exposed.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first isolated in three people associated with severe respiratory illness following a mass outbreak in Wuhan.
The visual characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are all in the form of naturally occurring coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus dies in household soap, dissolving its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin that can be transmitted to humans.
According to genetic analysis, coronavirus is the only group of the beta-teronaviruses in the Serbian virus genus (genus B) with two species that are genetically derived from bats.
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only a single amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the two strains of the disc-shaped virus and the human-caused virus.
So far, comparisons of the entire reproductive material of a living organism have found more than 92 percent genetic similarity between the African ant-eater coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, and this finding alone is not enough to prove that the African ant-eater is a vector.
While the diagnosis of viral infection is temporarily based on symptoms, confirmation can only be made by replicating the same DNA of an infected person and reversing the response (rRT-PCR) or by reading a CT scan.
In a study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR but less accurate, with many image features being similar to other pneumonia and disease outbreaks.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used in testing for COVID-19 or as a first-line test.
The WHO has released a number of RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done with breathing or blood samples.
Test results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
The test is usually performed with a throat scan, as with a cheek scan. Laboratories and companies are expanding their blood plasma tests to detect antibiotics.
As of 6 April 2020, they have not been proven to be accurate enough to confirm that they are widely used.
Only laboratories accredited to the US plasma testing program run by Cellex have been approved for emergency use.
X-rays and computed tomography (CT) are used to detect the unique characteristics of people who are showing symptoms, including the appearance of glass-like opaque displays in the non-essential lungs and the presence of pulmonary infiltration.
The Italian Association of Optometrists is building an international online database of imaging findings from confirmed patients.
Because of its similarity to other infectious symptoms such as respiratory viruses, the diagnosis of COVID-19 cannot be determined without confirmation by PCR.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT scans and PCR tests, demonstrating that imaging can work faster and easier in areas with little specificity for infection, and recommended that it be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Complex neural networks based on artificial intelligence are being developed to image and detect the surface features of the virus using both X-rays and CT scans.
A set of strategies for preventing the spread of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, touching eyelids, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing and sneezing on tissue and putting the tissue directly into garbage cans.
People infected with the virus are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
The report also recommended distancing practices to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned and advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has already spread to communities in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in communities where individuals within those communities do not know how they were infected.It is recommended that health care workers who are caring for someone who may be infected use standard precautions, pre-exposure protection, and eye protection.Exposure tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further infection.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns for the security of personal data, and the International Peace Keeping Organization and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Various mobile phone apps have been proposed for implementation or voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-based solutions, such as using a user's Bluetooth to access the nearest other mobile phone.
If there are close contacts with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, users will receive a notification.The widespread misconceptions about infection prevention such as washing the nose and flushing with mouthwash are ineffective.
Many organizations are working on the development of a vaccine for COVID-19.
The report also states that the government is not prepared to take any action to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands are significantly dirty, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus is external to the human body, and the virus can be killed by bursting bubbles protected by household soap.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content in doses if you are not ready to rinse with soap and water.
The WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose and mouth without washing their hands.
Surfaces can remove a large number of solvents, including 62%-71% alcohol, 50%-100% isoprosanol alcohol, 0.1% sodium hydrochloride, 0.5% hydrogen oxide, and 0.2%-7.5% polonium-iodine (by exposing a sterile surface to water in one minute).
Other antibiotics, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less potent.
The CDC recommends that all areas where there is suspected or confirmed COVID outbreak, such as offices or daycare facilities, offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchpads, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines, where patients may be contacted, be disinfected.
Health organizations urge people to cover their mouths and noses with a nail, cover with tissue, and dispose of tissue immediately if they cough or sneeze.
Infected people are encouraged to wear operating room masks, and wearing a mask reduces the number and range of fluid particles that can be spread through talking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing masks can reduce exposure to the main source of infection, the face, in people who do not have proper personal hygiene. Masks are also recommended for those who care for someone who may have the virus.
The WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a COVID-19 patient, but they say that wearing masks can help people avoid contact with their faces.
In many countries, campaigns have been launched to encourage people to wear face and nose masks while walking in public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical fabric masks. In China, health officials specifically recommend the use of disposable medical masks when communicating more than 1 meter (3 feet) in public.
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks while using public transport or in public places.
Thai health officials are urging people to make masks at home and wash them daily.
The government of the Republic of Moldova has announced a ban on public transportation without masks or nose and mouth covers.
On March 16, Vietnam urged people to wear masks to protect themselves and others when visiting public places.
The Australian government has ordered everyone to wear a mask when entering shopping malls.
Masks are required for all people visiting public places in Israel.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, announced on April 1 that passengers on trains and intercity buses will be required to wear masks.
Panama has made masks mandatory whenever outdoors and recommended that masks be made for those who cannot afford them.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (physical distancing) includes measures to control infection aimed at slowing the spread of infection by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, and closing schools, workplaces, indoor sports venues, cinemas, or shopping malls.
Individuals may adopt non-contact social lifestyle practices such as staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using non-contact speech, and avoiding physical contact with others.
Many governments are now enforcing or encouraging social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of people who could gather, recommended by US government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 (if there was no local COVID-19 outbreak) to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. The CDC recommended that older adults and people with poor health conditions from areas of mass epidemic, such as those at risk of diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and severe illness due to decreased immunity, stay home as much as possible. By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations were maintaining close and long-distance contact with people, but to facilitate understanding the purpose of reducing physical contact, the term social distancing was being replaced by the term "social distancing".
The use of the term social distancing has led to the interpretation that people should live in complete isolation from the environment rather than encouraging contact with others in informal ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
They include encouragement to have sex only with someone who is not infected with the virus or who does not show symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who suspect they may have been infected.
Health services have issued detailed guidelines to follow in implementing appropriate self-isolation.Many governments have also encouraged or legislated prohibitions on self-isolation for all residents in infected areas.
The most severe self-isolation and quarantine guidelines were issued for the most vulnerable groups.
People who have been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 or who have traveled to a region or country where there is a high prevalence of the disease are encouraged to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of their last contact.
The strategies in controlling the spread of the disease are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Control is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak, tracking and isolating infected individuals and other infection control measures aimed at preventing and stopping the spread of the disease to the remaining population.
If the spread is no longer controllable, it is necessary to shift to a mitigation level: measures to slow the spread and minimize its impact on the healthcare system and society.
Both the inhibitory and the mitigating functions can be combined simultaneously.
To reverse the global spread, more stringent measures are needed to contain the spread by reducing the baseline number of infections to below one. It is an attempt to reduce the peak infection as part of the effort to control the spread of infectious diseases.
This can reduce the risk of overwhelmed healthcare industries and provide more time for the process of finding treatments and treatment options.
Medical and non-medical interventions to control the spread of infection include hand sanitization, personal preventive measures such as wearing masks and self-isolation, organizational measures aimed at reducing physical contact such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings, and participatory public action to encourage the adoption and participation of the above actions, and environmental measures such as facial hygiene.
Other countries have also taken different measures to control the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and field quarantine, and warnings have been issued on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support to those who are infected and self-quarantined and imposes heavy fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face and nose masks and has imposed sanctions on the stockpiling of medical supplies. Similar trials for the UK and the US have found major challenges in both slowing down (only slowing down, not stopping) and slowing down (reversing the rate of epidemic growth).
The most effective policies of relief can reduce the need for health care by up to two-thirds and deaths by half, but hundreds of thousands of deaths are still occurring and health systems are still struggling.
However, if measures are relaxed during the period of the virus' spread in the population (if the vaccine is available first), infection may recur rapidly and maintenance is necessary.
The pandemic will require long-term action and could cause social and economic damage.
There is no specific antiviral drug for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop drugs, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the infection, oxygen therapy, dialysis and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the effects.
Several drugs that have been approved for use in other viral diseases are also being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also said that traditional and home remedies can help alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said capacity building and transforming healthcare to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is a fundamental response to the pandemic.
The WHO Regional Office and ECDC issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services to shift resources at several levels, including focusing on laboratory tests for COVID-19 testing, eliminating voting procedures if possible, quarantining and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, enhancing intensive care capacity through staff training, and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories about who the first patient (called patient zero) was.
When the coronavirus outbreak was first identified, it can be traced back to the possible start of the outbreak on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In the past month, the number of coronavirus cases has been steadily increasing.
Most of them are related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where live animals are also sold, and one theory is that the virus originated from an animal, or in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin.The mass outbreak in Nian was discovered on December 26 for unknown reasons, treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the epidemiological hospital, who himself reported to the Wuhan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues that they had a variant of the coronavirus, similar to SARS.
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was severely warned by her superiors for escalating the panic.
The Wuhan Health Commission later issued a public statement on December 31 and notified the WHO.
After receiving enough reports of unidentified pneumonia outbreaks, Wuhan health authorities began investigating early in January. During the early stages of infection, the number of infections doubled every seven and a half days.
Wuhan, a hub for transportation and a major railway junction, with the number of visitors for the Chinese New Year, spread the virus to other provinces of China in early and mid-January 2020.
As of January 20, China reported nearly 140 new infections, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed 6,174 people had symptoms and were infected as of January 20, 2020. By March 26, the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the world's most confirmed cases. On April 9, 2020, it was announced that there were 1.61 million confirmed cases worldwide, with 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
The country and its 200 territories have at least one case.
In Europe, the pandemic has led many countries in the Schengen area to restrict free movement and introduce border controls.
National measures include restrictive measures such as curfews (also known as stay-at-home orders, stay-under-the-ceiling orders or lockdowns) and time-limits, as well as lockdowns. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or 90% of the population in the United States, more than 50 million in the Philippines, more than 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India, have been locked out.

In Hungary, the parliament voted to authorize the granting of unlimited powers to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the suspension of elections and parliament, and the punishment of those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the pandemic.
The increased global consumption of equipment to combat coronavirus infections has led to unnecessary cuts in supply, panic-induced bulk purchases, and disruption of factories and logistics.
The US Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical supplies due to rising consumer demand and disruptions in production and distribution.
The panic and overcrowding has led to the purchase of all the essentials in the supermarkets, including food, toilet paper and water bottles, and the lack of supplies has been witnessed in many areas.
In the tech industry, in particular, early warnings have been issued about the usual delays in the delivery of electronic goods.

It has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, which could put health workers at risk, the WHO warns.
In Australia, the pandemic has given a new opportunity to buy Australian-made goods to China through Digo (a person outside China buying for someone inside China).
The movement led to a shortage of baby powder in some supermarkets, which was subsequently banned by the Australian government. The COVID-19 outbreak has spread to northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and food shortages have been particularly prevalent in both regions as a result of the increased demand for food products.
China and Italy have blocked the storage and illicit trade of vital products to avoid the prospect of a massive famine in Europe and North America.
According to industry representatives, there is no significant decline in the important agricultural production sector in northern Italy, but prices are likely to rise.
The food stands are empty, but only temporarily. In Wuhan, the capital, Chinese government officials have released pork to ensure that people have enough to eat.
In Italy, similar legislation exists that specifies requirements for food producers to store food in such emergency situations.
The global economic devastation hit China hard. According to a news outlet on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by the measures taken by the government to slow the spread of the virus, with retail sales falling by 20.5%.
China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, and when the virus broke out, it was seen as a major threat to destabilizing the global economy.
Agatha Damaris, of the Economic Intelligence Unit, predicts that the markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the possible outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the impact of the recession on global development during the current pandemic could be worse than during the outbreak of the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated the impact on the global supply chain to be $300+ billion and could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reported a "slap in the price of oil" following a slump in oil prices due to low demand from China.
The global stock market crashed on February 24 due to a sharp increase in the number of COVID-19 infections outside China.
On February 27, US stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell due to rising concerns over the coronavirus infection, breaking the record low for the period since 2008. The Dow fell 1,191 points, the biggest record drop in a single day since the 2007-08 recession.
All three indices fell to over 10% by the end of the week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH approved China's debt rating, but maintained a pessimistic attitude.
The stock market fell again on March 16, the biggest drop since the coronavirus crisis.
Many people consider a recession to be a possibility.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central banks and countries for their timely emergency measures.
Central banks reacted faster than during the 2008 recession.
Tourism is one of the sectors worst hit due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist attractions, and advising against any travel by governments around the world.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Kuanta Airlines, had to cancel flights due to low ridership, and British domestic airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry is reaching an unprecedented level.
Many railway stations and ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincided with the main tourist season Chunyun, which is associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Private companies have also closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland on their own, and national and local governments have cancelled large-scale events, including the annual New Year's Eve celebrations.
Many traditional Chinese New Year celebrations and tourist attractions, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple complexes in Beijing, have been closed to prevent crowds.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, cities and regions under the regional administration system, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most business locations not to reopen before that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has been declared a state of emergency, with schools closed until March and New Year's Eve celebrations cancelled. Retailers around the world have also been hit by reduced opening hours and temporary closures.
The number of retail shops in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a drop of 50 to 60 percent.
In addition, the number of people walking to shopping malls in March fell from 33 to 43% compared to February.
Shopping centers around the world are using additional methods to determine the number of people living in extreme poverty, such as increased cleaning, installing thermometers and temperature checking customers, and cancelling events. The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that the number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America could rise from 14 million to 22 million by the time the pandemic begins.
During the high infection rate in Wuhan, China lost about 5 million jobs in January and February 2020.
Nearly 300 million rural migrant workers in China are trapped in homes in the mining districts or inside Hubei province.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis estimates that 47 million jobs could be lost in the United States due to the coronavirus infection, with unemployment rates reaching 32%. In India, the lockdown has left more than 10 million Indian migrant workers (day-paid workers) unemployed. A survey by Angus Reid University found that 44% of Canadian households have also been similarly unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers were denied temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers were covered by a comprehensive debt plan. About half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to short-term employment programs offered by the government, known as Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term work-related compensation scheme was adopted by France and the UK.
The pandemic has caused massive damage to the arts and cultural heritage sectors, as well as to the organisation's operations, as well as to individual employees and freelancers, on a global scale.
Art and cultural organizations have sought to continue their mission of providing access to culture to the public, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and providing artists with as much support as possible (often sponsored by the government).
In March 2020, universities, museums, libraries, entertainment venues and other cultural facilities around the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, festivals and entertainment were cancelled or suspended.
In response, there have been intense efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly accelerating phenomenon due to the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as concerts and stages, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican also announced that it had canceled the Risen Week, held in Rome during the last week of Lent, in memory of Christ's suffering.
Many parishes have advised older Christians to stay home instead of attending Sunday Mass. Some have made prayer available by radio, live online or television while others drive to and from church services.
Rome's Roman Catholic cathedrals and places of worship and Christian worship were closed, other religious services were cancelled, and gatherings were banned in churches, mosques, synagogues, churches and caves.
The Iranian Ministry of Health on Friday banned religious services in infected areas and later closed mosques.Saudi Arabia has banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and banned their citizens from visiting the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant stoppages in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
Plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July, were halted due to the pandemic. The International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the Games would be rescheduled for a date later than 2020 at the latest, no later than the 2021 summer season. Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed, and live broadcasts of chess tournaments were cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers turning to online gambling, and according to online gambling sites, they have seen a significant increase in new subscriptions. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and many bands have had to suspend or cancel tours.
The film was released on December 15, 2011, by Universal Pictures.
Some artists have found ways to continue and share their work on the Internet instead of the traditional live performance format, such as creating live dance events or web-based live events where artists perform, distribute and deliver their work to audiences.
In the midst of the unrest, many people have turned to humor and distraction, and many internet memes related to the coronavirus have emerged.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, East Asian ethnic and other vulnerable populations have been experiencing a decline in tolerance, increased xenophobia and increased racism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
Fear, suspicion and hostility are common in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, and North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Since February, reports have documented racial stereotypes expressed by various groups around the world that Chinese people are worthy of the virus or are being punished for justice.
In some African countries, we are also seeing rising anti-China sentiment.
Many settlers in Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against based on their nationality.
The Chinese in the affected areas were not only supported online but also externally.
Suspicion and fear have been raised in Italy, the first country to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, following the spread of the infection to new countries that had not previously been infected.Citizens from countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed initial visa requests to ban Chinese nationals from entering their countries in an attempt to stem the spread of the infection.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is popular in Japan, with the following tweets:
Other Asians, including Chinese in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported experiencing increased racial segregation and abuse.
Critics have criticized the US President Donald Trump for referring to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus, a term that is anti-Chinese and racist.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who had migrated from Wuhan to Novosibirsk.
Students from the northeastern part of India bordering China, who are studying in major Indian cities, say the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted their education.
Dil Ghosh, state president of Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese were "reprising" the people for destroying nature.
The comments, which could later be described as "non-correct", were condemned by the Chinese Consulate General in Kolkata. The epidemic has led to fears and incitement to racial discrimination against non-Chinese residents in China, and foreigners have been described as "junk" and "targeted" for elimination.
Many newspapers with monthly subscription access have removed the feature that would have allowed them to read all or some of their coronavirus outbreak news from subscriptions.
Many publishers of scientific literature have published scientific papers on the epidemic so that anyone can access and read them.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results on pre-print servers like bioRxiv.
Infectious disease in transition - infectious disease of an emerging pathogen; often its spread is exceptional in extent or mode of transmission.

Laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 virus related to respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include methods to detect the presence of the virus and antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in patients was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects and analyzes the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of coronavirus.
This test is specifically designed to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
Recent or active infections have been confirmed.
Antibody detection (plasma) can be used for both diagnosis and community follow-up.
Antibody tests show whether people have ever been infected, including those with too mild symptoms to report, or those without symptoms.
The results of this trial can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the levels of collective immunity in the population.
Due to testing restrictions, no country has been able to release reliable data on the spread of the virus among their population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3 percent of its population, and the number of tests that have been done in many countries varies widely.
The difference also seems to have a significant impact on the mortality rate of diagnosed patients, which is significantly higher than expected in some countries.
Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory tract samples that have been treated by various methods, including nasal mucus samples or saliva samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests with throat lesions are reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus then continues to multiply in the lungs and disappears in the throat.
Infected individuals tested in the second week can either use a tube that sucks samples from the deep respiratory tract or a coughing tube (sputum).
In January 2020, an early PCR test using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was conducted at Charité in Berlin, identifying 250,000 test kits as the basis for World Health Organization (WHO) distribution.
Unit One also identified a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech identified a clinical-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit on 28 January 2020.
It is the first company in China to receive approval for emergency use from the China National Medicinal Goods Administration for its PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has distributed its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR test detection tool to public health laboratories through a national test source.
One out of three genetic tests in the previous test kit was for chemical synthesis and the results were not all covered by the bottleneck test at the CDC in Atlanta. It was an average of less than 100 successful tissue samples per day for the entire month of February 2020.
The bi-material tests were not decided on as acceptable until February 28, 2020, when the state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under emergency use authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing is nationally available.
Quest Diagnostics has done the same to make COVID-19 testing available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limits have been announced. Sampling and operations will be conducted in accordance with the CDC's specifications.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Post-Immunization in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reported that it had identified a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that would be performed in large numbers over 3.5 hours, so that approximately 4,128 tests per machine could be performed in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization to Abbott Laboratories for testing of Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cepheid received an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA for a 45-minute trial on March 21, 2020.
The FDA has approved a test using isomeric nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
The necessary combinations of the variable temperature cycle are no longer required, but this method can provide a positive result in five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott hopes to scale up production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is developing a test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically synthesizes the nucleocapsid (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, which is expected to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 language review suggested that the early stages of diagnosis are of little value, while CT (computed tomography) findings may be present before symptoms appear.
Typical features on CT include multiple glazed patches on both sides with no similarity at the lateral edge and lateral distribution.
As the disease progresses, there is a growing sense of social domination, insane placement and solidarity.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the origin of the current global epidemic, was less accurate, but its manifestations have many overlaps with other pneumonias and disease progressions, and CT is significantly more capable of modeling than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that CT should not be used as a first-line test for testing for COVID-19 or for diagnosis.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to diagnose infection, assess immunity, and monitor populations from the onset of symptoms to 7 days. Diagnostic tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or point-of-care testing (PoCT) sites.
High-throughput automated systems in many medical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their effectiveness will depend on the rate of each system's output.
Sequential tissue samples can be used to study immune response, but are typically used in a single blood sample with multiple legs for CLT.
A single blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained by skin piercing.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction stage is not required before testing. As of March 26, 2020, the FDA identified 29 organizations that have made notifications to the agency and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorizations for their diagnostic devices, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies that fight the virus in human blood samples.
It is capable of testing hundreds of samples within hours, which is much faster than traditional PCR virus RNA testing.
Usually, antibodies are detected within 14 days of the start of infection. Britain found antibody testing kits it purchased in early April didn't work well.
Hong Kong has set up a system that allows suspected patients to stay at home. The emergency department will give the patient a tissue sample tube. They put saliva in it, send it back, and the results are soon known. The UK NHS has announced that the model of testing suspected patients at home is a pilot, which eliminates the possibility that the patient could infect others if they arrive at the hospital and the infection if they use an ambulance.
Driving test centers help South Korea get the fastest and most extensive testing of any country. In Germany, the National Necessary Health Insurance Doctors Group said on March 2 that they were able to do 12,000 tests per day in their quarantined location, up from 10,700 tests a week earlier.
When a doctor prescribes a test, the insurance company will cover the costs.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, traffic tests will be held in many cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany is unknown, as only positive results are published.
The first laboratory survey was released on 12/2020, with a total of 483,295 tissue samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 with 33,491 samples (6.9%) and 12/2020 week. Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel have identified a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously. Further testing is to be carried out only after the samples are collected and the collective sample shows infection.
The five-day model, overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, suggests that if this testing capability is not realised, infections in Hubei could rise 47 percent and the cost of handling travel restrictions could double.
Immediately, Wuhan Laboratory as well as the Huaiyan clinics in Shanxi, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai followed in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, daily pass testing is 50,000 tests per day. Open source, many of which are sophisticatedly designed, the machine, manufactured by Origami Assays, can test for COVID-19 on 1122 tissue samples of patients in one day using only 93 assays. These biased designs can be used in small labs without the need for fluid-handling robots.
The only thing that has been left for mass testing in the EU, UK and US as of March is the lack of enough reagents.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation procedures that involve heating samples for five minutes at 98 °C (208 °F) to produce RNA genomes for further testing.On March 31, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced that it is now testing more coronavirus per capita in its population than any other country, and is on track to reach the primary outbreak for the majority of the population.
The combination of the ability to drive through and a large-scale mass-explosion by group 42 and BGI (their Huo-Yan-Yun Emergency Detection Laboratory in China).
The lab, which took 14 days to build, carried out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day, and was the first laboratory in the world outside China to operate on this scale.
Different clinical trial methods targeting different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has provided the German combination for a range of manufacturing materials to low-income countries without the need for resources to produce them themselves.
The German drug combination was released on January 17, 2020. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention delayed the availability of the tests in the United States, and they were not available until January 28. Early in the pandemic, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and those countries and Australia were unable to provide adequate supplies of test kits and health professionals' recommended tests until the requirement was met.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's widespread availability of testing could help reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has been building testing capabilities, primarily in private labs, for years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization urged accelerated testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests being accumulated in private US laboratories, which have run out of supplies and chemicals.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with the accuracy of their test kits.
In the United States, the CDC produced a test kit containing "errors". The government subsequently removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kit from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explains that the incorrect results could be the result of flaws in sampling or the correct use of the test kit.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would recall diagnostic devices that produce erroneous results and replace them with diagnostic devices supplied by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the Chinese diagnostic devices purchased by the Czech Republic produced erroneous results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million diagnostic devices from China, which were found to produce incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be dumped into the Danube. Ates Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a high error rate and no use of cheating. The UK had purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced that they were not available as of early April 2020.
Testing, isolation of infected individuals and tracking of people who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals have yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, isolated the city's population of about 3,400 and tested everyone twice for ten days.
About half of those tested showed no symptoms and all those who tested positive were quarantined.
The government has also been trying to prevent the spread of the virus by restricting travel.
With intensive exposure tracking, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread much more slowly than in other developed countries, without requiring excessive restrictions on restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled and residents were urged to stay at home on 28 March in Singapore, but schools reopened on time on 23 March after school holidays.
Many other countries have implemented strict contact tracing, restricting domestic travel and quarantine in the management of the epidemic, but not strict restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with more testing had very low mortality rates, possibly because those countries were more able to detect weak or no symptoms.
For countries without testing capabilities and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19, the WHO has recommended that they send their first five positive samples and the first ten COVID-19 non-positive samples to one of the 16 laboratories recommended by the WHO for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
The following table shows the percentage of people infected by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients, whether they have symptoms or not, will have a higher percentage of infections compared to countries that test the entire population in other respects.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing one's hands with the intention of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted objects.
Consistent hand washing with soap at certain critical times of the day prevents many infections, such as diarrhea and diarrhea, which are spread through the urinary tract.
People who do not wash their hands before contact with their eyes, nose and mouth (the mucous membrane) can also contract respiratory diseases, such as the common cold or influenza.
The most important times to wash hands with soap and water during the day include before and after going to the toilet, changing the baby's underwear or diapers, before feeding the baby, preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or pork.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends handwashing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing, you may need to take a bath.
After contact with animals, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to environmental hygiene practices related to medical practices.
Hand washing before medication or medical care can prevent or reduce infection.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogenic microorganisms) and chemicals that are harmful or can cause disease on the hands.
It is particularly important for those who handle food substitutes or those working in the medical environment, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing can have many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, preventing gastrointestinal infections, and reducing respiratory infections.
The number of babies born at home is also lower than the number of babies born at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing habits may lead to a slight improvement in long-term development in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates are associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, which can be reduced by simple behavioral changes such as soap and handwashing.
This simple action can reduce the death toll from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea by a third, comparable to providing access to clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in bowel movements can be attributed to soap and handwashing. Soap and handwashing are one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent bowel movements and serious respiratory infections (ARI), such as automated actions in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
The primary ARI, pneumonia, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, causing the deaths of about 1.8 million children each year.
The number of children who die each year from both diarrhea and pneumonia is estimated at 3.5 million.
UNICEF says that making hand-washing with soap and water a regular habit before and after eating and using the toilet could save more lives than vaccines or medicines, reduce deaths from diarrheal diseases by almost one-tenth, and reduce deaths from respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is often associated with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sewage and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects wounds that are infected by direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of handwashing is that frequent handwashing causes skin damage by drying the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin discoloration known as itching, scarring or hand pain, common among health care workers.
Excessive hand washing is known to be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times in a day to wash hands with soap to reduce the spread of infection from the stool to the mouth: after using the toilet (toilet, urination), after cleaning the baby's feces (changing the diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand sanitizer should be used to prevent infection include before and after treating a tear or wound, after sneezing, coughing, or snoring, after handling animal waste or handling animals, and after handling garbage.
In most countries, soap and handwashing are very scarce.
In 2015, a handwashing study in 54 countries found that about 38.7% of households practiced soap and handwashing. A 2014 study found Saudi Arabia to be the highest at 97%, with the United States at a median of 77%, and China at the lowest at 23%. Several behavioral transformations have been identified to improve soap and handwashing behavior at critical times.
The "Health Care Without Borders" program implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a major effort to improve children's health and education.
The national program is based on the principle of the two-year curettage, daily hand washing with soap and daily flossing with toothpaste.
It is also being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by soap or laundry detergent in water.
The main function of soap blocks and soap powders is to reduce the barriers to solubility and increase solubility.
The fat and protein that are part of natural soil do not dissolve easily in water, so rinsing with water alone cannot effectively cleanse the skin.
But the proper flow of water helps to clean up.
Because of its recyclable nature, soap can retain bacteria from previous use.
A few studies that have studied bacterial transmission from infected soap crystals have concluded that removal of bacteria with a soap sponge is unlikely.
The CDC recommends that more hand soap be used for washing.
The soap is especially advertised for the health conscious.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of recommended antibiotics or of selective antibiotics for natural antibiotic-infected microbes.
However, the most common antibacterial soaps include common antibacterial ingredients such as trichlorate, which has multiple layers of biological resistance.
So even if antibiotic resistance is not selected for the bacteria-killing soaps, they may not be as effective as they are intended to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin-protective products, many modern formulations use acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, tetracyclic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid, which is antibacterial, and other skin-softening agents (which may include shampoo, vitamins, spices, and herbal oils). A comprehensive review by the Oregon School of Public Health found that soap is as effective as other antibiotic-containing soaps such as tyrosine in preventing infection and removing hand bacteria.
The temperature of water that is suitable for handwashing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing impurities and bacteria-preserving natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using boiling water has no effect on reducing the presence of microorganisms in hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antibiotic hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most isopropyl alcohols or ethanol are formulated as a gel using carbo-amino (acrylic acid polymer) or as a liquid using a humidifier such as glycerin or as a powder to facilitate consumption and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding weak hydrogen peroxide further enhances the anti-microbial activity. Hand sanitizers with a minimum alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective in killing germs.
Alcoholic laxatives kill bacteria, many antibiotic resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and certain viruses and fungi (including HIV, rubella, RSV, rhinovirus, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and hepatitis).
A 70% alcohol alcohol hand sanitizer kills 99.97% of bacteria on the hands within 30 seconds of the application (3.5 lb reduction or 35 decibels reduction) and 1 minute after the application kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 lb reduction) of bacteria on the hands. Hand sanitizers are most effective for bacteria and less effective for some viruses.
For the most common causes of infectious gastroenteritis and intestinal infections, norovirus or norovirus, alcohol-based detergents are almost completely harmless. Rubbing with enough detergents or alcohol to keep both hands moist or clean is recommended.
The two sides of the hands, between and on the tips of all fingers, are rubbed until they are dry, usually in a liquid, foam, or jelly form for about 30 seconds.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hands that are significantly dirty should be washed with hand sanitizer instead of rubbing and cleaning.
The popularity of this solution is based on its ease of use and quick killing of microbes, but if it is available, it should not be substituted for proper water and soap washing.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if the solutions are not softened and/or skin moisturizers are not added.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding a cosmetic oil and/or other skin conditioner to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing skin softeners caused much less itching and dryness than soap or antibacterial cleansers.
Contact allergy, skin irritation, contact plasmoblastic syndrome, or hyperreaction to alcohol or addiction to alcohol towels are rare.
The lower incidence of skin rashes caused by uncomfortable contact compared to hand washing with soap and water is interesting.
Although these are effective, non-water detergents do not disinfect the hands, but they simply disinfect the hands.
This is because the pathogens remain in the hands, and hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizer is very close to the ingredients and the composition formula, and historically significantly lower than the performance of alcohol and alcohol-containing sperm.
Recent formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown consistent, combined antimicrobial activity when used, unlike alkaloids, which may have decreased efficacy due to increased adverse skin reactions after repeated use.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and instead use ashes or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than just water, but it's not as effective as soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, as it forms alkaline liquids when in contact with water.
When soap is not available, the WHO recommends using ash and sand instead.
The correct hand hygiene, as recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, includes the following steps:
Keep your hands moist with running hot or cold water.
Because vertical hand sanitizers can be dirty, it is recommended to use only continuously flowing water if there is no temperature difference.
Rub your hands with soap, including the soap on the palms, between the fingers, and under the nails, to let the foam out.
Studies have shown that people who wash their hands with soap rather than water, are more likely to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Rub and rinse for at least 20 seconds.
While rubbing causes friction and removes bacteria from the skin, prolonged rubbing can remove more bacteria.
Wash thoroughly with continuous flowing water.
Washing hands in a sink can re-destroy your hands.
Use a clean towel to dry or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands are susceptible to germs. Typically, the most common areas of contamination are the thumb, wrist, between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
The use of a nail polish separately from a nail polish can store microorganisms.
Skin moisturizers are often recommended to keep hands dry. Dry skin can cause skin damage, which increases the risk of re-infection.
"A variety of low-cost options for handwashing can be made available where public water and/or soap are not available, for example, by watering from a hanging rectangular basin or a dry pot with appropriate sized holes, and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as 'one-pipe taps' and other less expensive options".
A pipette is a simple technique where a small amount of water is drawn by a rope and poured onto a soap by hand with the foot.
Although effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, there is still debate about the most efficient form of hand drying in public toilets.
A large amount of research suggests that towel paper is cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the European Tissue Symposium, a tissue paper manufacturer, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the disinfection levels of tissue paper, air hand dryers and more modern pneumatic hand dryers for disease prevention.
After washing hands and drying them with a thermostat, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Air drying results in an average of 42% more bacteria in the fingers and 15% more in the palms of the hands.
After washing hands and wiping them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76 percent and on the palms by 77 percent. Scientists conducted tests to confirm whether each method of drying could spread to other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The hand dryer, which pumps air from the mine at 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and the mine into the toilet environment and other toilet users up to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of air-pumped hand dryers allows the spread of microorganisms from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
The paper towels are not markedly contaminated with microorganisms. In a 2005 study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria have been observed after drying hands:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers with toilet paper are compared.
Hand sanitizer is a useful way to wash your hands when traveling without access to soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing has been a standard practice in the medical field since the first time that the effectiveness of handwashing in preventing disease in a hospital environment was discovered by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis in 1846.
There are electronic devices that can provide feedback to alert hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that using them reduced infection rates.
Medical handwashing is the practice of rubbing the hands individually with a combination of soap and water or gel on the skin for a minimum of 15 seconds.
You should rub your hands against your fingers.
If there is any damage under the nails, bristles can be used to remove it.
The bacteria can remain in the water on the hands, so it is important to drain the water clean and dry it with a clean towel.
After drying, use a towel to seal the water (and, if necessary, open any exit doors).
It protects the hands from re-infection from these surfaces.
"The purpose of handwashing in a health-care workshop is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("pathogens") and prevent their transmission".
The New England Journal of Medicine writes that while poor handwashing remains unacceptable in most medical environments, many doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before dealing with patients, causing infection with microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can reduce the incidence of intrauterine infections associated with tetanus by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has distributed a paper illustrating standard handwashing and massage practices in healthcare settings.
The organization's draft hand hygiene guidelines are also available for public comment on its website.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial hand sanitizers can measure and verify hand hygiene when regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has set a "five-minute" time limit for hand washing:
After contact with blood or bodily fluids
Before a pathogen-free activity, and
After the patient is treated, in addition to soap, additional antibiotic chemicals (antibiotic soaps containing antibiotics or antibiotics) are added to the hand sanitizer to provide an antiseptic effect.
Such an elimination procedure is necessary in situations where antibiotic-filled microorganisms are abundant or prior to the surgical procedure. Surgical procedures require no additional sterile devices to clean under the nails, such as a self-closing water hose, chlorhexidine or iodine cleaning, a sterile towel for washing and drying, and a sterile brush for rubbing.
You should take off all your gloves.
This procedure usually requires washing the hands and palms up to the ankle for 2-6 minutes.
You don't need to fight for long periods of time.
The water from the tips of the hands should not be allowed to return to the hands during washing.
After you finish washing your hands, dry your hands with a disinfectant cloth and wear a surgical suit.
To reduce the risk of infection, hand washing or hand sanitizer should be used before and after treatment.
In hospitals, the best benefit of handwashing in controlling staphylococcal infections occurs in the first 20% of washings, and the smallest additional benefit is found when the number of handwashings is increased by more than 35%.
Compared with antibacterial soap and washing, plain soap and washing have three times higher rates of bacterial infection into food. Compared with rubbing the hand with alcohol-based liquids and washing the hand with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, rubbing the hand with alcohol-based liquids reduces the bacterial content by 26% more than antibacterial soap and washing.
Handwashing with soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing the number of hands that are contaminated with H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile.In healthcare settings, efforts to promote hand hygiene may include educating staff about handwashing, increasing availability of flu-based hand sanitizers, and alerting staff by letter and word of mouth.
The most effective of these measures in different healthcare settings requires more research.
In developing countries, soap and handwashing are recognized as a cost-effective and vital way to improve health and nutrition.
However, the lack of access to water, soap or hand sanitizer in homes, schools and workplaces can be a challenge to handwashing practices around the world.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are inexpensive options for installing hand washing machines, but hand washing machines are very rare near private or public toilets.
However, the lack of handwashing is more related to traditional practices than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating for soap and handwashing can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioural change for many people.
It needs monitoring and evaluation to work effectively.
A systematic review of study 70 found that community-based action approaches were effective in promoting more widespread handwashing practices in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries) and social network marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of promoting handwashing practices in schools is UNICEF's "Star Approach", which encourages students to wash their hands thoroughly with soap, using simple, cost-effective methods in schools.
When meeting minimum standards, schools can change from one star to a maximum of three stars.
The construction of handwashing facilities can be part of the handwashing promotion movement, which aims to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is an example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve behavioral change. UNICEF has advocated the use of handwashing emojis in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Some studies have considered the overall cost savings of handwashing in developing countries by avoiding DALYs.
However, one observation is that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly cheaper than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as newborns or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of personal hand hygiene, the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
The majority of people still believe that infections were caused by bad smells, known as miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-related infectious diseases led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively advocate hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak have led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing and soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, in public toilets and office buildings in Germany, and in airports, posters with the words "correct handwashing methods" are hung next to handwashing toilets.
The phrase "wash your hands" means that someone is unwilling to take responsibility for something or to share in it.
It originated in the text in the Bible of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands for the decision to crucify Jesus, but has become a phrase used more broadly in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands vigorously in an attempt to clear the image of the outcast, reflecting her sense of guilt for the crimes she has committed and the sins she encouraged her husband to commit.
People wash their hands more often than others and value handwashing devices more when they recall or reflect on immoral behavior.
In addition, those who have such a mindset and are later allowed to wash their hands are less likely to engage in alternative clean-up activities such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for purification and ceremonial purposes. The ceremonial washing of hands with only water and no soap is a traditional medicine practice used in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Judaism's Tawila and Nattilá Yádim, Christianity's Lavo and Islam's Wādh. Religions also prescribe hand washing in accordance with health, especially after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam teach washing hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims practice hand washing before and after meals.
Risk control at work for COVID-19.
Workplace risk control for COVID-19 is the use of workplace safety and health measures for risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control at the workplace depends on the risk assessment of exposure resources on the workplace and work objectives, the severity of the disease in the community, and the factors that may pose a risk to individual workers who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with high exposure to other coworkers and low risk of infection are recommended for basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, enforcing rules for snoring and coughing, and performing routine sanitary disinfection of the workplace.
Jobs that require frequent or close contact with people who do not know or suspect COVID-19, as well as jobs that may be infected through mass transmission or international travel, are also considered to be at moderate risk of infection.
This includes schools, densely populated workplaces, and some wholesale-level situations where workers are exposed to the general public.
In addition to basic infection prevention activities, risk controls for this group include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, nasal protection, and personal protective equipment if necessary in contact with a person with COVID-19.
Health care or cardiothoracic workers who come into contact with people with known or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, and if they are workers who collect or handle tissue samples from people with known or suspected COVID-19 or who make airborne particulate matter, OSHA defines exposure as extremely high risk.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as well-ventilated rooms with negative pressure and personal protective equipment that is appropriate to the job objective.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had many impacts on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can vary both in the goods demanded and the way they are obtained (e.g., by shopping during rush hours, or by delivery or by car-sharing services).
Finally, the export of supplies from rural areas where COVID-19 has been severely spread may be delayed. The Prevention and Response Plan for Infectious Diseases can be used as a guide for preventive actions.
The projects address a range of exposure sources, including risks associated with a variety of workplace and business objectives, risks arising from the structure of the home and community, and the extent of individual risk factors for workers, such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address these risks and can provide backup measures for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Prevention and response plans for infections are based on national or regional recommendations.
Goals for the response to the outbreak include reducing infection among employees, protecting people at higher risk for subsequent health incidents, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other businesses' supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the workplace community affects the response.
Risk management grading is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to group risk management methods according to effectiveness.
When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by management controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker practice and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Management control is a change in the work policies or procedures that the employer or employee is required to perform.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and management controls, but it helps protect against certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the worker's occupational hazard, properly installed (e.g., respirators), uniform and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained as needed, replaced, removed properly, cleaned and then stored or disposed of without damage.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have the least exposure to the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if the day is bad, covering up coughing and sneezing, respiratory practices including giving out tissue and leaving garbage to be disposed of, preparing for long distance communications or isolating workplaces if necessary, prohibiting workers from using other programs and equipment, and continuing to maintain routine hygiene practices in the workplace and environment.
Rapid identification and quarantine of infected individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness to stay home until at least 24 hours after the onset of fever, hypertension, and other symptoms, without taking antifungal medication or other symptom-modifying medications, and to have flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay home and care for sick family members, and to make staff aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, workplaces with frequent or close contact with suspected COVID-19 patients or unknown persons within 6 feet (1.8 m) are considered to be moderately at risk of infection. However, the person may have recently travelled across the country to an area where COVID-19 is prevalent, and the patient may be at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 due to the local spread of infection throughout the business environment.
These include workers who have been exposed to the general public, such as schools, crowded work environments, and some high-risk retail settings. They also include the installation of high-efficiency air filters in engineering controls for higher-risk groups, increasing air leakage rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic nasal barriers, and installing drive-through windows for emergency customer service. These include a variety of other measures, including providing emergency medical treatment for higher-risk groups in the workplace, providing emergency medical assistance to sick workers at home, and providing training and other information on COVID-19 prevention and safety measures, including the use of masks and other protective equipment to prevent workplace injuries and workplace hazards, and providing training and training to workers who need to stay in contact with COVID-19-preventing contacts.
Workers in this dangerous group do not usually need to use respirators.
Proper controls to properly protect staff and other passengers if someone is sick on board include keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning a flight attendant to care for the sick person, and giving the sick person a mask when coughing or sneezing, or having the sick person cover his or her nose and mouth with a tissue paper.
Aircrew should wear disposable medical gloves when handling infectious surfaces or body fluids or when servicing a sick passenger. If possible, aircrew should wear additional personal protective equipment if they detect symptoms of fever or persistent coughing or shortness of breath in a sick passenger.
Handcuffs and other disposable items are discarded in biohazard protection bags and any surfaces that come into contact with them are subsequently cleaned and wiped. Risk control measures are to be taken, including delaying cruises and self-isolation during illness for commercial ships, including luxury ships and other passenger ships, and immediately informing the on-board health centre in case of fever and other symptoms during the voyage.
The best place to perform health follow-up is in the isolation ward. Whether or not the community has spread the infection, the CDC recommends that schools and child care facilities be temporarily closed for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person has been in school buildings.
Social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as field trips, meetings, and other large-scale community gatherings such as exercise or singing classes, or dining at cafes, during low to moderate mass infections, increasing space between tables, scheduling to avoid conflicts in arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with colic-like symptoms.
At a time when many infections are occurring in local communities, social distancing strategies as well as extended school closures may be considered.The CDC defines a nearby health hazard as low for law enforcement officers who are conducting routine daily operations.
Law enforcement officials who are in close contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical professionals, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during the emergency period, workers should clean and disinfect their jute covers and gear with household cleaning spray or dry clothes before re-use, and then follow the standard procedures for inserting and disposing of used PPE and for inserting and disposing of clothing.
OSHA classifies certain health care and cardiothoracic workers as high or very high risk.
High-risk jobs include healthcare delivery, supply, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who are in contact with people who know or suspect COVID-19.
If workers are collecting or handling COVID-19 from people who are known or suspected to have it, and spreading particulate matter into the air, it can be extremely dangerous.
Procedures for transferring particles into the air include tubing, cough reduction procedures, airway inspection, certain dental procedures and tests, or obtaining tissue samples from inside the body.
High-risk cardiothoracic operations involve workers involved in the preparation of cadavers of patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death. They are at extremely high risk if they undergo a cardiothoracic examination. Additional engineering operations are performed for such risk groups, including procedures that produce airborne particulate matter, including isolation rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
A specially designed negative pressure ventilation system is suitable for some health care facilities and air conditioning.
The samples are treated with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that arriving patients be placed in quarantined facilities depending on the suspicion/absence of COVID-19. OSHA recommends that respirators be worn in conjunction with PPE for those who suspect or know of SARS-CoV-2 infection and who work within 6 feet of patients and who undergo procedures such as respiratory tubing and ventilation.
In the context of a comprehensive and documented respiratory protection program in the United States that includes fitness testing, training, and clinical trials, NIOSH-approved N95 filter masks or better are used.
Other respiratory masks can provide more protection and make the worker feel more comfortable. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted through body fluids, so WHO does not recommend full coverage.
The WHO recommends that medical staff use only a surgical mask at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory tissue samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosolization, or who care for or transport patients, the WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, swimming goggles or masks, suits and gloves.
If the process of creating particulate matter into the air is performed, the surgical nose mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respiratory masks.
The WHO recommends that the need for PPE be reduced as much as possible by using modern communication technologies to provide healthcare (telemedicine), physical barriers such as glass windows, allowing only people to wear PPE when they are in the room with a COVID-19 patient, using PPE only for essential functions, continuous use of the same respirator while treating multiple patients with the same disease, continuous monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE, and encouraging the use of a headscarf for those who have not yet shown symptoms.

We are looking for outstanding situations for ourselves this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made our human interaction and responsibility to each other all over the world a clear reality.
While we have no tradition for these challenges, we know that our best response depends on global compassion, collaboration and community building at the heart of this organization.
The heroic spirit and caring that I have seen among all my colleagues through emails, phone calls and chats are recognizable proofs of the admirable humanity that we have been fortunate enough to work with.
I couldn't be more proud of you.
Last week, someone said that they were praised for their work.
They remind the world how important it is to change Wikipedia now and how powerful a symbol it is to keep this vital resource online and accessible to all.
Whether you're making the workplace better, or your colleagues are making it better, or your community is making it better, it's what you're doing.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This is the time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments starting next week to how we will work together.
The Bible says: "The one who is in the house of Jehovah is his servant, and he is his God".
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-team discussed their engagement and timetable for the coming days and months the night before.
In this conversation, we consider our thoughts as the appropriate response to what we are facing and the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization during this time.
Overall, we want to take the stress off and make it a contribution to our long-term business goals.
If you need to call back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and all contractors and workers:
Their daily work expectations are 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a closing day. - If you can work overtime, the mission can use you.
The world is unpredictable, but whether it's getting care for loved ones, shopping for supplies, or seeing a doctor, our priority is to meet every need.
It's not about chasing your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
The people of the country are not talking about it, but they are talking about it.
No sick days or PTO needed: Just talk to your manager and help your team rearrange calendars and schedules to cover key work areas.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please inform Bryan within T&C Ops so that T&C can help ensure that appropriate attention is received from the supply and management.)
We'll pay full wages to hourly workers.
As we have said, we are once again determined to honor our hard work for our contractors and our part-time staff colleagues.
Under normal circumstances, everyone is paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
The letter says that you are sick and should not work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work to relieve their stress in their environment.
We are very happy to be able to do what we can do, especially in this time.
Once again, it's something you have to take care of yourself.
We ask you to contact your manager so that we can find out what to do and negotiate accordingly.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.
The government has also been trying to get rid of the government's budget deficit.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security and Fundraising teams (among other departments) do important work to provide the extra support they need.
We will shift our focus to work with all departments to identify current objectives and what is essential to support their business objectives.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we all need to focus on the more important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt in the future.
We don't plan to travel twice as fast to catch up once we're past the pandemic.
You won't have to spend extra time on deadlines that are no longer possible.
We have accepted that the situation has changed and will work to set new targets and timetables.
What about the APP?
They want to adjust the timing of their 2020-2021 plan to balance their new reality with their daily work hours expectations.
Their goal is to propose an extension of their 2019-2020 plan, which allows employees to spend more time on budgeting to prioritize important tasks, taking care of themselves and their loved ones, allowing those who want to or want to work on reduced schedules in the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule greatly reduces the workloads currently being prepared and the pressure on the entire organization.
The following week, they will present their proposal to the board and once they get their approval, they will inform the delegates and the team about the final terms of the next phase.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership here.
The Bible says: "The one who is in the house of Jehovah is his servant, and he is his God".
Last week, one of our colleagues in San Francisco was diagnosed with a possible COVID-19 infection.
However, with a few caveats, we hired a virus-cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office's desks, chairs, etc.
They use hospital-grade antiviral sprays to disinfect not only every surface but also the living room and the elevator frames that reach their floors.
The building has set a personal responsibility procedure for the use of the facilities that support the safety of their tenants.
The office is well equipped to make them feel comfortable when they decide to return.
Their DC office is located in WeWork, where they share their COVID-19 practices with all DC-based employees.
In line with the guidelines shared from San Francisco, we have transformed our DC office into a fully remote operating system over the past week.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we are also consulting on renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but there may be delays.
Some of my colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
They know that their long-term remote colleagues have adjusted it and want to give you some advice.
Limit the length of the meeting to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need longer tasks, think about how you're going to group them over a few days.
Clearly describe the meeting, plan ahead, and send the contents in advance.
Keep the video original to allow programs like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and communication.
Make each meeting easy to remember: Have someone monitor the conversation, keep a list of speakers, and ask someone to help write notes or to co-write notes to ask questions.
If you need a comfortable headset, email technical support.
Spend your fitness money on your toothbrushes.
Join the #remoties thread on Slack to talk to your colleagues about divided jobs.
The HR business team is reviewing a web-based Productivity Environmental Guidance to support the growth of the Foundation's cross-sector businesses.
This week, we urged all community organizations that receive funding to postpone public events such as the Wikimedia-sponsored Editorial Conference until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We will let them know that we understand that their demand for their cancellation and other restrictions will not allow them to complete their agreed upon tasks and that we should not punish anyone for delaying or changing their objectives.
Next week, we will continue to provide additional guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
While the general attitudes among communities around the world are saddened by the interruption, they feel relieved when they are clear and focused on their own communities, Wikimedia and other things.
Moving forward, CRT is working to build a Meta-Wiki page so that the community can monitor the impact and follow-up of their connections.
Have a hands-on study on issues related to COVID-19.
We are sending out our invitations to your calendars for the Special Staff Meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional edits, answer your questions, and spend time chatting with each other.
We will face it together and we are ready to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to browse this email and find all other unknown COVID-19 information on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep the latest information on these pages and make sure that all information is available in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff living in countries where the recent outbreak is significant.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major career path or insurance challenge or any other type of assistance you need, please let CRT know and cooperate.
We are ready to provide assistance and coordination as needed.
If you have any issues that are confidential or not publicly known, please email Bryan Juan, our Human Resources Director for International Operations Worldwide.
They don't see any of these changes as their job or responsibility.
Instead, they are now recognized and seem to need to accept their work and responsibilities in a way that they did not in the past.
These are the things we believe in, and these things need to support each other, or we can continue to work, provide the support they need through our movement, and continue to provide the service they depend on in the world.
And his work shall be in his days, and his thoughts shall be with him.
Now is the time to support each other and make room for the important work that will be happening in the weeks and months ahead.
We need all of you to work to make this happen, and you all need to take care of yourselves and your families, or you will be the best for you when your needs arise.
And now, wash your hands, and do not touch your face.
Catherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
It is particularly useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases because ACE2 inhibits the activity of the related Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of Angiotensin-II and increasing the level of Ang (1-7). ACE2 also acts as an intracellular entry point for some coronaviruses.
The enzyme in humans is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transport domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein that interacts with the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues with its enzyme-activated domain.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the domain along the cell membrane by another enzyme called sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most body parts - ACE2 is primarily found in the cell membranes of lung type II aviola cells, in the enterocyte cells of the intestine, in the arterial and venous membrane cells, and in the arterial smooth muscle cells of most body parts.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the outer layer of the brain, the striatum, the part of the brain that regulates hormones needed by the body, the nervous system, and the hypothalamus, the part of the brain and spinal cord that regulates hormones.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE inhibitor.
ACE binds the hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which constricts the blood vessels.
Subsequently, ACE2 is cleaved by angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) to carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine, which is then hydrolysed to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also fight many other pathogens, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, aspirin, neurotensin, dinophene A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane-transmission of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19, and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
ACE2, a transmembrane protein, is a receptor site as a key entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the fusion of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 in the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells can cause both the virus and the enzyme to enter and migrate to endocytes located within cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host's seroprotein TMPRSS2, which is currently being studied as a protein therapy. Some researchers have hypothesized that lowering the levels of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, various academic and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing use of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A study combining systematic review and statistical data published on July 11, 2012, found that ACE inhibitors were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia of up to 34% compared to comparative studies.
"In addition, ""especially in patients with stroke and heart disease, where the risk of pneumonia is elevated, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been shown to reduce the risk of pneumonia".
The results are less robust for all cases of pneumonia, but the use of ACE inhibitors may also reduce pneumonia-associated deaths.
Genetically modified human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for severe lung damage, and has been shown to improve lung circulation and oxygen saturation in piglets with blood poisoning due to sudden acute respiratory infection that causes immune-boosting polycystic kidney disease.
The 24-hour duration of the drug's effect (duration) in addition to the half-life of rhACE2 in the human body is about 10 hours and 30 minutes at the time of drug onset.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a potential drug for people who are resistant to simple renin-angiotensin system antibodies (RAS antibodies) or for those with elevated circulating angiotensin II. The combination rhACE2 has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to enable the process of exposure tracking, i.e. identifying people who have been in contact with the disease ("exposures") in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic".
In some jurisdictions, many applications have been developed or proposed with official government support.
Many infrastructure have been developed to develop touch tracking apps.
There have been concerns about the security of personal data, especially with regard to systems that track the geolocation of app users.
Other less intrusive methods include using Bluetooth waves to record the distance between the user and other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would integrate the Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has developed an app that connects to Alipay and allows citizens to check if they have had contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already used in over 200 cities in China.
The app was developed by a local community of IT professionals and will be made available for free to the government. In North Macedonia, StopKorona! is a Bluetooth-based app launched to track contacts with infected people and help healthcare authorities respond quickly.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"The government announced on 12 April that the development of a touch-tracking app is in its final stages and will be launched in a few weeks. Similar apps are being planned in Ireland and France ("Covitra")."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure that COVID-19 patients living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Andresen, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed practical problems with app-based systems, including inefficiencies and false authentication when only a small percentage of the population uses the app.
To address concerns about the spread of "misleading or potentially dangerous" "coronavirus" apps, Apple has restricted which categories of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, and only those that are "official" or otherwise reputable.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of people using coronavirus applications, especially the possibility of the cancellation of surveillance infrastructure created for monitoring the coronavirus epidemic once the infection is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:
The quarantine must be legal, necessary and proportionate.
The extension of the quarantine period may include provisions in the law that it will automatically end after a specified period.
The use of information will be restricted for COVID-19 purposes.
The data security and anonymity must be protected and the protection must be based on evidence.
The report also highlighted the need to prevent digital surveillance from exacerbating discrimination and exclusion.
The law shall provide for the sharing of information with external organizations and individuals.
The right of citizens to have laws to protect against torture and to respond to torture.
"A meaningful participation of all ""relevant stakeholders"" including public health professionals and marginalized groups will be required". The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Grenzen (RSF) also issued action lists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring by eliminating the need for tracking systems and removing them from their device operating systems.
Some countries have adopted network-based location tracking instead of apps to eliminate the need to download apps and avoid tracking.
Network-based tracking has been approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that provide access to location data sheets have significant privacy security issues.
However, not all systems that include central servers need to access individual location information. A number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for interface communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track exposure to the virus.
Instead of using a relevant app, the system collects data, including data tracked by various means, including mobile devices, and card payment data, and combines them to send alerts to potential infections via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert people who may have been in contact with the virus, the government has made location-based information publicly available, which has been permitted by several changes to the data security law since the outbreak of MERS in the country.
The data is available to everyone in many apps and websites, and many countries, including Germany, have adopted a centralized privacy management system.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Contact tracking to protect personal information security is a concept that has been well documented by comprehensive research papers developed since at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, several expert groups are working on appropriate solutions for personal information security, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record user interactions with other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is not a single process, but a coordinated effort involving both centralized and decentralized methods. The decentralized process includes centralized contact tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T) to protect personal information security, temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy-critical processes and systems (PACT) for mobile communication tracking, and more.
These procedures will include random checks of personal identification information only within the device and never outside the device.
A team at MIT Media Lab is implementing SafePaths, a platform that uses proprietary techniques to collect location or route data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on data from a paper titled "Maintaining Privacy During an Apps Gone Rogue-Pandemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform from Enigma MPC, a company that originally founded privacy security technologies at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share critical location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of their data.
The Global TCN Joint Commission was established on 5 April 2020 by groups that have come together with a fundamentally common approach and approaches that are almost identical, with the goal of reducing disparities and developing tracking and alerting applications that can be used together globally, a key role in widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used on its official government app freely available.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a method for touch tracking, which they claimed would protect the security of personal data as it is based on a combination of Bluetooth power-saving technology and encryption/reading to protect privacy.
They also released details of the key technologies used within the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be officially released in three phases:
The government introduces tools to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
To integrate the feature directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to address ongoing surveillance issues by releasing the system first through operating system updates and then removing the system in the same way as the threat is over.
b'Drug re-targeting (also known as drug re-targeting, reclassification, re-processing, or therapeutic modification) is the re-targeting of a drug approved to treat a different disease or medical condition than it was originally intended to treat.
It is the subject of ongoing scientific research to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of plasma from infected and recovering patients. SARS-CoV-2 contains 66 pharmacologically active proteins, each containing multiple molecular synthesis sites.

A study of the combination of antibiotic-based retroviral (lopinavir) /HIV/AIDS (ritonavir) concluded that there was no benefit.
Drugs have been developed to prevent the spread of HIV by binding to proteins.
A research team at the University of Colorado is working to refine drugs to find a compound that binds to the protein enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. There has been criticism within the scientific community about sources that point to the re-targeting of drugs specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included the retroviral drug lopinavir/HIV/AIDS ritonavir in its international co-ordinated trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir could be used in the treatment of filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronavirus-related infections.
One issue with viral sterilization therapy is the enhancement of immunity through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and spread.
Some early preliminary studies that have recommended RediCivar may have a significant genetic barrier to immunity. There are several clinical trials underway, including two conducted by the University Hospitals of Kelsey-Vorland for a moderate case and one for a more severe case.
Three clinical trials are currently underway with vitamin C paralytic medication for people with severe COVID-19 and hospitalized, with two placebo controls (China and Canada) and one placebo controlled (Italy).

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a potential vaccine for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has yet passed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against the deadly virus SARS-CoV-2 to be available for 18 months.
As of April, there were five vaccines in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was first diagnosed in December 2019.
The major outbreak spread globally in 2020, leading to significant investment and research efforts to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using the released clones to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI's critical initiative for vaccine development was confirmed to be accelerated by speed, productivity, scale, and global availability.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that there were 10 different technology platforms in the research and implementation process that took place during early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine to fight COVID-19.
Key platform commitments that have advanced to Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (stage I carrier and proposed vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
The virus-related dose (stage I agent and vaccine designated drug: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 dose)
As of April, CEPI scientists report that 115 new drug packages are already in early-stage production, with 78 active validation projects (according to Milken University, 79) and 37 announced but with little public disclosure (presumably in the planning or design phase).
In determining more specifically effective drugs, Phase I-II trials are pilot safety and clinical trials that are conducted in multiple areas with controlled, ineffective placebo-controlled trials.
While monitoring for adverse effects at optimal doses, Phase III trials involve more participants, including controls, and testing for the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease.
Of the 79 vaccines currently in development (approved in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (preliminary trials are still ongoing).
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was exploring the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify the proteins of the virus to stimulate an immune response.

In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Medicine announced the development of a new DNA-based vaccine that can be administered by nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria, producing harmless virus-like particles that stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, three US government, industry, and universities combined resources with computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google to gain access to supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
In Australia, another randomized trial is trying to enroll 4,170 health care workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early studies evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of COVID-19 using specific experimental animal models such as ACE2-genetically modified mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates have shown the need for international collaboration to address live viruses with biosecurity-based three-level containment methods and standardised safety procedures.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal samples.
As of 2020, there is no cure or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was believed that the current SARS research would be useful in finding vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are undergoing trials, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines: two adenoviral-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 is known and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents supported by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic effects for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus and vaccines.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, sore throat, shortness of breath, and stomach cramps and diarrhea.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Most patients develop mild symptoms, but some develop pneumonia and multiple organ damage caused by the virus.
As of 17 April 2020, there were 2.24 million infections and more than 153,000 deaths in 210 countries and territories.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is transmitted among people primarily through small droplets from coughing, sneezing or talking, often during close contact.
The particles released when inhaled usually do not travel long distances and fall to the ground or surfaces.
Many people can become infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching infected surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
Although infection is most likely before and in the later stages of the disease, the first three days after symptoms are most severe. The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nose and throat.
The use of masks is recommended for people who suspect the virus and their caregivers.
Some authorities have advised against the use of masks, while others have recommended the use of masks, while other countries have recommended different recommendations for the use of masks by the general public.
Currently, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or treatment for a specific virus.
Local infections have been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, panic, difficulty waking, and burning of the face or lips. In the event of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.
You may also experience upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as frequent sneezing, sneezing, or sore throat.
Different percentages of digestive disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed.
Some patients in China initially showed only chest pains and heart palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, organ damage, and death.
This is called the embryonic period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection, and reports indicate that not all infected people show symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic people in the infection is not fully understood, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may be a contributing factor to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with the virus without showing symptoms is currently unknown and is still being studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases of the virus do not show symptoms during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began adding asymptomatic people to its daily patient list on April 1, with 130 (78%) of the 166 infected people that day asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Slime, saliva, and tooth sap can carry large amounts of the virus.
Speaking out loud produces more fluid than normal speech.
In Singapore, a study found that unprotected coughing can cause small droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
While the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences found the virus' RNA in sunlight samples from ventilators installed along corridors outside public rooms, which could be bioairborne infection.
Medical procedures such as respiratory tubing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) cause respiratory mucus to become tiny particles floating in the air, causing airborne infection.
The risk of infection is low, while there are concerns that infection may occur via feces. The virus is most contagious when symptoms are present.
While it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is transmitted, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that one person normally infects two to three other people. The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus has been found to survive on cardboard for one day, plastic (formed plastic (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and copper 99% for up to four hours.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
When used correctly, soap and detergents are also effective, as soap-related products not only break down the fatty layer of the virus, rendering it inactivated, but also making it invisible on the skin and other surfaces.
Other liquids, such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroxide galconate (an antibiotic used in the laboratory), are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were obtained as an intermediate two days after admission to hospital.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral concentration, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral concentration on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus first isolated from three people with pulmonary disease associated with a severe respiratory disease community in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus also occur in the corresponding naturally occurring coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the explosion of a bubble protected by household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus enters the host cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type 2 aviola cells in the lungs, and the lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19.
The virus binds to ACE2 and uses a special surface glycoprotein called the papilloma to enter the host cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of people hospitalized with the virus have a sudden cardiac arrest, which is more common in more severe cases.
The inflammatory response to the progression of the disease and immune system disorders have been associated with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease, but serious heart muscle damage may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac activity.
High incidence of blood clots in the veins (31%) and blood clot-blocking in the arteries (25%) are seen in patients in intensive care units with COVID-19 infection and may be due to poor prognosis.Throat tests of patients who died from COVID-19 have shown extensive aviola damage (DAD) and inflammatory permeability of lymphatic cells in the lungs.
SARS-COV-2 has a tendency to target the ACE2-transmitting epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, but patients with severe COVID-19 have more pronounced red skin symptoms throughout the body.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells have been shown to be associated with the accumulation of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
The first is the presence of lymphocytes in the breast.
The WHO has published a number of test methods for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed with respiratory samples taken from a nasal and throat swab, but nasal swabs or mucus samples can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require blood samples taken every year, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated the genome of the coronavirus and released the genetic code, allowing laboratories around the world to independently perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect viral infection.
An antibody test (which can test for the presence of current infection and previous infections) was identified on April 4, 2020, but has not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test shows that the accuracy is only 60% to 70%.
The United States FDA approved the first point-of-care test for use by the end of the month on March 21, 2020. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital recommend diagnostic methods based on clinical signs and epidemiological risks.
Incompatible spots with asymmetrical posterior marginal spread, splintered glass fragments on both sides of the lungs, are common early in infection.
As the disease progresses, the surface of the lungs may thicken, become rough (the labia interstitialis thickened with irregular dental fillings), and become stiff.
There is little information available about the causes of microscopic lesions and the physiological pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of heart exams are:
Microscopy: pneumonia, heart attack, bronchitis, and dipping into the lungs
The four severities of viral pneumonia can be explored as follows:
Mild pneumonia: Infiltration of the lungs, increased number of pneumocytes, the entry of abnormally large pneumocytes, lymphocytes, and the formation of large cells with multiple nuclei, along with inflammation of the interstitial space.
Acute pneumonia: diffuse leakage and diffuse discharge of air (DAD).
DAD is a common cause of acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) and severe intravenous oxygen deficiency.
The treatment of pneumonia: formation of mucus from the avian pathways and interpulmonary fibrosis
The blood-vessel distribution of blood clots (DIC), the human chorioblastoma response
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and that the inside of the elbow be used if tissue is not available.
Careful hand washing is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of masks in public places as part of its efforts to limit infections from people without symptoms.The public-distancing strategies aim to reduce exposure of infected people to large groups by closing schools and jobs, restricting travel, and eliminating large public gatherings.
The guidelines for maintaining social distancing also include keeping at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from the public.
There is no known and effective vaccine against COVID-19, and as a vaccine is not expected until early 2021, a key component of COVID-19 screening is to try to reduce the high prevalence of the epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after eating, coughing, or sneezing, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are too dirty.
It further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are readily available.
In such formulations, the antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used as an aid in the removal of bacterial spores. It is not an active ingredient for hand-packing.
The oil is then added to the water to keep it moist.
People are managed through supportive quarantine and other critical organ supplies that have an impact, including fluid therapy, oxygen supply.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
While the benefits of using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to treat respiratory failure are still being considered.
To build immunity, you need to practice personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle, and a healthy diet.
Supplemental treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the Chinese Commission on Ethnic Health have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Doctors and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled a collection of treatment recommendations from various health departments into an open source IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Preventive measures are needed to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in healthcare settings where procedures such as breathing tubes or hand-held respirators are used to remove pollen.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that patients be monitored in an airborne isolation room (AIIR) in addition to following standard prevention, exposure prevention and airborne contamination prevention practices.
The following items are recommended: PPE suits, respirators or masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. When available, use respirators (instead of masks) first.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved masks for emergency use by order of approval (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particulate matter such as dust in the air, but there is no guarantee of efficacy on specific biological agents for use without labeling.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks and the latest in sleeping masks when masks are not available.
Most people with COVID-19 need respirators or similar devices, but only a few do.
Currently, there are studies of a type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory problems in the general population in hospitals, and some evidence suggests that a strongly flowing nasal tube or a double-pass positive airway may prevent the infusion of a pressure pipe.
It is not known whether either of these two types leads to similar benefits for people with chronic illnesses.
Some doctors prefer to live with a more invasive mechanical respirator if possible, compared to a nasal tube with high airflow, because this method limits the spread of particulate matter in the air. Severe cases are more common in older adults (people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, the capacity of the health system to deal with the sudden rise in the number of severely ill COVID-19 patients is limited, with insufficient hospital beds for each individual.
According to a study in China, 5% of the population was admitted to the emergency room, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people with COVID-19 hospitalized are gradually admitted to the ICU.
COVID-19 has a sudden respiratory syndrome, which makes it harder to breathe on a machine as oxygen becomes more difficult.
Breathing machines and PEEP heights are needed to be able to perform the necessary pressure controls to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of respirator-related lung damage and air leakage between the lungs and chest.
The old respirators often do not have high PEEP levels.
The exploration of potential treatments began in January 2020 and several pathogenic drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Ramdisiva is the most promising.
Although it may take until 2021 for a new drug to appear, many of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses and advanced trials are underway.
In severe cases, antiviral medication may be tried.
The WHO advises volunteers to participate in trials for the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of recovering plasma as an experimental treatment when a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
The clinical trials needed to demonstrate safety and efficacy for the disease have not been completed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users must enter their name and ID number.
The app also uses surveillance data to detect close contact and potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies local health officials. In South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, people infected and those who have been in contact with the infected are tracked using big data analysis on cell phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial memory technology.
In March 2020, Israeli government security agencies were able to monitor mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
Measures are being taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may have been in contact with infected people.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the data collected on phone location with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, to conduct research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect those who violate the lockdown.
Giulio Gallera, the regional health commissioner in Italy, told him that mobile phone companies have informed him that 40% of the population is in some form of mobility.
The German government held a 48-hour hack contest on Saturday and Sunday with more than 42,000 participants.
Meanwhile, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid urged the world to create solutions to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
Many people may feel fear of lockdowns, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or infection.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: "Social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are a complete storm that threatens people's mental health and livelihoods".
The disease may be mild, with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as colds.
Mild patients usually recover within two weeks, while severe or severe patients take three to six weeks to recover.
Data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, suggest that pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. However, there is no data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory distress, blood poisoning, or multiple organ failure.
New COVID-19-related complications include blood poisoning, irregular blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting, especially increased progesterone time (blood clotting time), was seen in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 and abnormal kidney function was seen in 4% of the same group.
It is estimated that 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the same report, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death is 10 days, with five days in hospital.
However, the average time between admission to the hospital and death is seven days for patients transferred to the ICU.
In early case studies, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total of six to 41 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, compared to 1.7% for women.
Tissue pathology tests of pulmonary cardiac examinations have shown widespread aviola damage with fibromyotic secretions from cells in both lungs.
The virus has been found to cause cellular changes in lung cells.
The pulmonary picture is similar to that of sudden respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was attributed to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations are immunocompromised.Access to medical resources and the socioeconomy of a region also affect mortality.
Estimates of the death rate from the condition vary due to regional differences, but there are also differences due to technical difficulties.
Underestimating mild cases can lead to higher than expected mortality rates.
However, the fact that the death toll is now underestimated, as it has resulted in deaths for previously infected people.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 than nonsmokers, and 2.4 times more likely to be treated in intensive care and die.
Hong Kong hospital authorities report that amongst recovering patients, lung function decreases by 20 to 30 percent, and lung scans indicate paralysis.
It can also cause symptoms that are treated in intensive care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether previous infections had been effective in the long-term recovery of those who recovered.
Although immunity is possible based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, in cases recovering from COVID-19 outbreaks, they have been reported to be positive in later coronavirus testing.
In these cases, residual infection is more likely than recurrent infection.
The virus may have originated naturally and evolved through animal origin.
Although the exact origin is unknown, by December 2019, the infection was almost completely human-to-human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 patients published in The Lancet in January 2020 indicated the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
The earliest reported onset of symptoms in official WHO publications was on 8 December 2019.
Different measures are generally used for the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and duration, and also depend on population characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of health care, treatment methods, the time of the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health.
After 2019, when the WHO assigned codes for emergency ICD-10, laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as U07.1, and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection detected by a clinical test or epidemiological test that did not include laboratory confirmation were defined as U07.2. The patient-to-disease ratio is the number of patients who died during a given period of time divided by the number of patients who were tested.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate as of April 17, 2020 was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the infectious mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of the population infected with the pathogen that died from the disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the population infected with the disease that died (infected and non-infected).
The statistics are not based on a time limit, but on the precise number of people infected through the severity of the process.
Although not all infected people have antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the small Italian village of Castiglione d'Adda, which is the epicenter of the infection, 80 (1.7%) of the 4,600 inhabitants have died.
The outbreak at the Carnival in Gangelt, which spread to young people, resulted in relatively few deaths, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have such official ratings.
And the German healthcare system is not unsustainable.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of blood donors have antibodies.
69 people (0.004%) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the death rate vary between men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown that men have higher mortality rates.
The time difference between men and women is only 90%, and men in their 50s are at the highest risk.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of the six differences is still unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Sex-based immunological differences, lower smoking rates, and the risk of developing a joint disease such as high blood pressure at a younger age in men than women are also contributing to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of cases are men and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, tuberculosis and SARS affect men and women differently.
Women are more likely to be exposed to the virus than health workers, especially nurses.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease will be COVID-19.
WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the date refers to 31 December 2019, when the first detection of the outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in the case of COVID-19, VI in the case of Virus, D in the case of Disease and 19.
In order to prevent the spread of the virus, the names were given in accordance with international recommendations without reference to geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or population groups.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus that causes COVID-19" in public relations.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the Wuhan coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as intermediate names for the virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidelines, against the use of disease sites and virus names, as a serious respiratory disease.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in traditional distribution channels, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare products such as nose readers and respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was in desperate need of a ventilator valve, the manufacturer could not deliver it in time, so a small local business counterproduced and now produces 100 of the required valves overnight.
Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and fake news about the origin, spread, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have emerged and spread rapidly online.
It appears that humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral transmission in pigs, rats and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, expert groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a combined trial to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing pathogen-killing compounds, which appear to be the most effective.
Despite the lack of a vaccine, various agencies are actively promoting vaccination campaigns.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to penetrate human cells, using functions previously found for SARS-CoV.
Three vaccine strategies are being tested.
For the first time, researchers are working on developing a vaccine against the virus.
Using an inactive or dying virus is intended to rapidly trigger an immune response in the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, which is based on antibodies to the pathogen, is to create a vaccine that stimulates the immune system to fight off some of the virus's antibodies.
In SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, the research focuses on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel method for vaccine detection).
The first trial of the vaccine was launched on 16 March 2020 in Seattle with four volunteer trial subjects.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code inherited from the pathogenic virus. A potential challenge in the development of a vaccine for SARS-COV-2 has been suggested, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are reportedly over 300 clinical trials underway.
Several trials have examined approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
According to a report released in late April, nine Phase 3 trials of renamed antiviral drugs, which are part of most Chinese research, involve several countries.
The ongoing review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic drug was initiated in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including rammedisever, chloroquine, and hydroquine, pipinavar/ritonavar, and pipinavar/ritonavar and interferonbeta combined.
The goal is to have evidence of Ramadi's effectiveness by March 2020.
The clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with Rameswar, which has not yet been confirmed.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, Italy and China. A chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer-review for research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities have endorsed the use of chloramphenicol.
However, the recommended daily dose is one gram, but Wuhan Virology Science notes that twice that amount is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydrochloric acid and chlorine, with the consent of doctors treating people with COVID-19.Seventh edition guidelines in China also included interferon, ribberine or umifenova in the treatment of COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that large doses of antiviral drugs are needed to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the test tube.
Nitrozannide has been recommended for further in vitro studies after demonstrating low inhibitory activity of SARS-CoV-2.Template:Citation needed Complete membrane protein serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 via ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chlorophyll and hydroxychloroquine, whether or not they contain acetamines, have no further studies and significant limitations that have prevented the medical community from pursuing these therapies.Oxymetavir is not a barrier to SARS-CoV-2 outside of the community and it is not known what role it plays in the treatment of COVID-19.
In the severe post-COVID-19 stages, a reaction called cytokine stasis is often followed by a body reaction.
Hydrochloric acid has been shown to have anti-cytokine-reactive properties. After a small study, the National Health Commission of China included tossilizomab in its therapeutic guidelines.
Italy is conducting a national phase 2 non-viral trial after a positive test in a critically ill patient.
Combined with plasma ferritin blood tests to detect cytokine resistance (reactive inflammatory syndrome), it aims to counteract the development of these events, which are thought to be the cause of death for some affected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved the drug for the treatment of unregulated cytokine-producing syndrome caused by different factors, and for the treatment of CAR T cells based on reviewed case studies.
To date, there is no randomized controlled trial that proves that tosilezumeb is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and soluble antibodies produced by the immune systems of COVID-19 recovered people to those who need them is being investigated as a way to induce autoimmunity without vaccination.
This strategy was tested for SARS with uncertain results.
The mitigation of the virus is a anticipated feature as the micro-antibody therapy may link in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.
However, alternative methods, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other forms of automated antibody therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are still in development.
The production of plasma containing specific antibodies to the virus, which is a component of the blood fluid in recovering patients, will increase for faster practical utilization.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital who contracted COVID-19 and later died after raising awareness of the virus' spread.
