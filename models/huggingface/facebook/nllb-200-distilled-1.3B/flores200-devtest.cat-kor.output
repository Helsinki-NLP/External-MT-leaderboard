korn: This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already very widespread theory, but it offers details that fossils normally can't offer, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
korn's plumage was brownish brown at the top with a light or carotenoid background.
korn's discovery also offers a view of the evolution of feathers in birds.
korn is a species of dinosaur. Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed canon, called rachis, but do have other features of feathers - beards and barbels - researchers deduce that rachis was probably a more recent evolutionary development than these other features.
korn, a.k.a. "the young dinosaur", was found in the early 1900s, and the structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or display.
korn suggests that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, and not a plumage.
