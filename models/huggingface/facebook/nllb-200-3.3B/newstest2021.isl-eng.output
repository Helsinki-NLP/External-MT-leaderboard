A Call to the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to be well under way, and the noise and the noise of nature is beginning to reach people far and wide.
'You have the headset, I need Iceland,' says a woman in the wider world in comments to an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the YouTube channel.
Another spectator says that Iceland will be in her heart forever, and a young woman says she has to go to the other end of Iceland if her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States, and she anticipates waiting for a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the runway to Iceland is ready, because there are no planes.
It doesn't matter if he comes from another time.
Egill Þórðarson of Peel, who created the ads with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the interviews have been more than expected.
I found many of the Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already hitting the mark.
Basically, it's about creating publicity, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have been covered by some 700 media outlets worldwide, reaching a total audience of some two billion people.
The value of that treasure is estimated at $1.8 billion.
It's not impossible.
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although Americans are not coming to the country anytime soon.
According to Egils, markets such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also been well received, as has Russia, which is pleasantly surprising.
Then there have been responses from foreign regions, such as India, that were not specifically mentioned.
"These ads have traveled farther than we thought", Egill says, "but that's because over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
We couldn't have asked for a better start.
The pictures here on the cover were taken by Dawn photographer Arni Sæberg, who took a photo of an advertisement with the headline "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The races were held far and wide, such as at the School Guard Day in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjörður, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökli and in Hell at Hjörleifshöfða.
The film was directed by Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson of Skoti productions and shot by Óttar Guðnason.
The roles in the two films were played by Anna Jia from Iceland and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as the recordings were taking place in Southern Iceland, there was another group in Western Iceland and the West Fords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first installment of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is intended to be a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office", says Egill, adding that the partnership with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
It's great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.
Explosive: Discussion on the state of the job market, pension funds, and more
Minister Einar Daðason will attend the Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market, the Icelandair case and other issues.
It also deals with rural issues and the relocation of work to a country that has been badly affected and controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, Chairman of the VR, will also be attending the event, where he will discuss his criticism of life insurance fund investments and put forward ideas on how trade unionists and business people should withdraw from the boards of the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then they will be interviewed by Ivar Ingimarsson, a traveling overseer in Austria, and by Arneheiði Jóhannsdóttir, executive director of the Nordic Market Office, about the situation in the rural tourism field.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a false harbinger of what is to come.
The program can be heard below, but it begins at 10:00 a.m.
This is what it looks like today, 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of teen shows.
She gained worldwide fame, however, for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also appeared in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
She has been in a bit of a coma lately, but she was able to look back and comment on Clueless on Australian television in the evening.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, and says she was a wonderful person.
I have to admit that I built my character mostly on the girls I met at school who weren't nice to me.
"As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was", Donovan said of his appearance in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the station after a night shift.
About 50 cases were reported to the Metropolitan Police today, and the police diary says the cases were wide-ranging.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to replace a man who had recently been released from prison after serving a term of imprisonment.
The man refused to leave after his release and disobeyed police orders that he go on the offensive.
The man is facing a lengthy stay in the police station for his actions.
Then a man was arrested this morning on suspicion of burglary of a business in Copenhagen.
Police also had to take two men to Breiðholt for reports of physical injury.
Then, a woman who was a waitress at a shopping center in Kopavogi could not pay her bill after the meal, so she called the police.
There was also a report of a car being stolen in the downtown area this morning.
A driver of a white Renault van searched for her for a moment, and she was then taken by force.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Glitter - The Horrible Fate of the Glitterers
The theory has spread on the Internet that the curse rests on the Christmas season, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California during the season, becoming the third main character to die in the series' history.
The Glee series is a popular show about singing, dancing, and joy.
The series revolved around a supposedly happy group of high school teenagers, their loves and destinies.
Being in the circus was not always a luxury, but through song and dance, the characters seemed to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
But beyond the set, the show's cast and crew have been hit by so much tragedy that theories have been raised about the curse of the show.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a clapper who didn't call all of her grandmother.
After the season ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to press charges, and the domestic violence case was dismissed.
On July 8, Rivers was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found dead in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on the boat, and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had sunk to the bottom of the lake, and that Rivera had put him back in the boat, but had never returned to the boat herself.
A massive search was launched for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the local sheriff determined that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is said that she was caught in a violent current in the water and used her last strength to rescue her son.
The cause of death was listed as being drunk from an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson, the angel-voiced American football player who was instrumental in bringing the Glee Club to prominence and respect.
Outside of the show, Moneith was dealing with a personal demon.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to break free.
In 2013, his co-stars on the show felt enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to all look for a better way.
Just two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in his hotel room after going out to party with friends.
Baname turned out to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a matter of willpower.
Moneith had been undergoing treatment and his tolerance for the drugs had decreased so much that the doses he had previously tolerated well, turned out to be fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was a great loss to his colleagues, but his co-star, Lea Michele, was determined to keep the show going and dedicate the entire series to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took on the role of Noah  Puck Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Glee Club, or until he had the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possessing child pornography.
A search of his home revealed a huge amount of child abuse, and the matter soon became public.
It was clear that Salling was finished.
He was subsequently charged and found guilty of his crime.
He faced four to seven years in prison, as well as having to be on a sex offender registry and seeking treatment for child abuse.
Before a judge could decide on the sentence, Salling, who was then out on bail, was found dead near his home.
Dan's death was a suicide.
It wasn't just the actors from the show that were long gone.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He died suddenly in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
Also on the show was a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts, and she did not hold her sister in high regard, but accused Roberts of excessive dominance and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, blaming her mother and sister for her condition.
"My mother and my so-called siblings will leave me with nothing but the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression".
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her co-star's intelligence and oversight on set and of having a transgressive stellar personality.
Jesse Luken guest starred on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with a breach of the peace act in 2019, which caused a public uproar.
Heather Morris, an actress, had a major role in the show.
In 2010, she was the subject of a series of leaked nude photos by unidentified cybercriminals.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had an on-and-off romance.
Benoist later revealed that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything
Children grow more when they play in the garden with their parents, who cultivate flowers and watch them grow and develop.
There is also an infinite amount of work to be done with flowers, as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the air, and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
"I don't think there are many sailors working in kindergartens in the country", says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who goes fishing in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland in the winter.
Fishing on the beach is a very comfortable summer activity when you are in college.
Fishing is a good way to make a good living, and I think it's great to be able to get out of school without taking out a loan.
"The income also suits me well into the winter", says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who takes a summer fishing course, as he did in the past.
Axel was a newcomer to the Tálknafði pier when a reporter caught a report of him late in the evening earlier this week.
"In my tenth grade, I took a captain's license for boats under 40 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I've been doing shore fishing on my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jonsyni, and I named it after him.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped sailing, and he was very happy to see that it bore his name.
"Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat", says Axel, adding that he bought it for three million dollars.
I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I'd finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt free at the end of my first summer on it.
But how could a boy with a million and a half dollars pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
I had been working with my father on the sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my farm money in my boat bag.
Axel was born in Isafert, where all his maternal relatives are from, but he has lived in Kópavogi since he was a boy.
I can fish here in the West Country because I have a permit from my grandmother in the Isle of Man.
I learned about these areas here in the west of the roads with my dad.
I move between distances according to how I feel, for this fishing ground covers the entire West Bank.
Although I prefer the West, I have also spent time around the Snake River and beyond.
I've also been a fan of the sun, but I prefer the grasshopper", says Axel, who always gets up alone in the morning and sometimes talks to the gods and sings to the sky, in the privacy of hours out at the ballpark.
The internet connection is good out at sea, so I can make calls, listen to radio and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into trouble, but there have been occasional incidents of bad weather, but never a big risk", says Axel, who is fortunate in that he is never a drunkard.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunts are conducted.
In the coastal zone, I never fish for more than 14 hours at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the quota system, but then I have been out on the sea fishing for a continuous day and a half.
The shore-hunting nature of this fish allows it to catch up to 1,400 pounds (770 kg) a day, which it finds very satisfactory.
Other restrictions are that I cannot fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish 12 days a month, during the four months of the year when beach fishing is allowed, in May, June, July and August.
I think sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to cry instead of having 48 days over the summer and being able to choose whatever they want.
"I am also responsible for the shifting of the seas and the marine ecosystems that are well situated alongside the fisheries should benefit from it", says Axel, who draws most of the seaweed from the salty seas on his coastal paths, but also some of the fish and other unique species that come along.
Axel works during winter time with the university student at the kindergarten in Nupi in Kópavogur.
'I don't think there are many sailors working in the country's kindergartens,' Axel proudly says, adding that he only intended to work part-time at the kindergartens.
I'm stuck there because I think it's a wonderful job.
I hope that psychology will be useful for my future career in the field of sports", says Axel, who also has a long-standing business degree.
Villa in the registry prevented from coming home
The fact that the applicant was not included in the application form when entering the country meant that the person residing in the country was not invited back to the sample.
If the form is completed in English, as is the case when the form is completed in Icelandic, it is not necessary to provide an ID number.
"This will be examined this week", says a specialist in the emergency department of the country's medical service.
Three domestic infections were reported in the epidemiology department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of them tested positive and arrived on July 15, two days after the so-called home quarantine regulations went into effect.
Those who were resident in Iceland are then screened upon arrival and again invited to a field service four or five days later.
However, the RÚV afternoon news reported that the man had followed the old system.
The sample at the border was negative and he was not recalled for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the emergency department of the National Medical Council, told a news agency that this could be due to a mistake in the electronic registration form.
If you fill in the application form in English, you are not required to enter a class number as in the Icelandic version.
Even though it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned was not automatically invited to an examination.
However, Kamilla says many have followed the rules of the return policy even though they filled out the application form in English and in some cases employers have also been wary of sending people back to the country after they arrived.
This week we will look at how to make it easier for people to access this process and to draw attention to it.
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in a coma.
All of them are going to the lab, but two of them were starting to show symptoms.
The three infections reported yesterday are now being treated, but are largely contained due to the two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of the Icelandic DNA has revealed a variant of the coronavirus that has not been found here before.
In another case, the authorities targeted Israel, even though it was known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says we should know by tomorrow where the virus is coming from.
There are 15 in total in isolation, according to the COVID.is website.
135 are in the queue.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five inland infections have been confirmed in the last few days.
Of these, four are completely unconnected and it is still not possible to determine the source of the outbreak that broke out at yesterday's Rey Cup athletic meet.
The contamination is still prevalent.
Originally, the third dozen was sent exclusively in the shoulder, but it was reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 people are in critical condition because of the new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second case of infection in a short period of time at a sporting event, and it has raised questions about whether such an event should be held.
Johan K. Jóhannsson, director of communications for the public security department of the Reichspolizei, says that it is all right, as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
 We are constantly warning all residents of the need to maintain personal hygiene.
We also need to remind people who are hosting events that there are certain rules in place that must be followed.
Then you can have a party", says John.
He says that by maintaining personal hygiene, infection can be prevented.
Moreover, standards and regulations are constantly being reviewed.
What we need to do, and what the Public Health Department and the National Health Board are constantly advocating for people, is to pay attention to these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and in the service industry.
People washing their hands and drinking.
This prevents the infection from spreading", says Johan.
We need to encourage people to continue on the good path we have been on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved so far.
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how her father was struggling to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The patient was scheduled for a sudden respiratory complication due to a coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying condition, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing is about to happen to him.
The Reuters news service says Brumfield's fears are not without cause.
A recent study commissioned by the U.S. government found that nearly 40 percent of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.
When the proportion of those under 65 years of age is considered, the figure rises to half.
The CDC study included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says that the findings are striking, especially for those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
The slow growth rate was a concern, and Reuters commissioned a survey to compile the responses of the 12 countries that had similar rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Columbia, have yet to begin identifying underlying diseases.
The sugar epidemic was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now COVID-19 has erupted like a powerful virus, according to Reuters, according to Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also been hit by the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with type 2 diabetes is to control the disease through exercise, a balanced diet, and the help of health professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic, however, has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
The high cost of insulin has forced some to continue to attend work and thus avoid exposure to the virus.
Reuters notes that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk posed by the virus to those with type 2 diabetes.
When SARS emerged in 2003, roughly 20% of them had the disease, and in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, these groups were three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS first emerged in 2012, a study showed that 60 percent of those who died or were admitted to maternity care had diabetes.
Yale University researcher Charles S. Dela Cruz says that because the impact of COVID-19 could last longer, the pandemic has opened the door to a number of previously unknown complications.
"I fear we will see a tidal wave of problems when this is over", says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Federation.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney failure.
Recent research has suggested that the coronavirus may be responsible for the spread of diabetes.
Reuters reports that scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The heart, lungs, and kidneys are already vulnerable to damage in many people with diabetes.
In addition, high glucose-lipid levels in diabetics can cause a true "cell-to-cell" shock, as the immune system is called when it overreacts and attacks the body.
Damage to the endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which can cause fatal blood loss.
"It's all one big puzzle", says Dela Cruz.
It's all interconnected.
The news has been corrected.
They were offered champagne, so they left the room.
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason were unusually asked by the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was staging in Paris.
We loved each other, so it wasn't complicated.
Atli Bollason never forgets the first time he met his wife and mother, Asruena Magnusdóttir.
I was very impressed with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but then I thought she was also very inappropriately beautiful.
And he says, "I'm sorry".
Remember this too, as the husband regularly reminds the first mate of the truth of the matter.
I keep hearing this story.
"I'm only interested in the weekend", says the woman, who also had sex with her first husband.
I felt and feel so much pride around Atla, that I'm going crazy.
There's a lot going on and a lot of things happening, and I'm excited about it.
Atli says that the couple have emphasized the need to be separate in their relationship.
We don't tie our bags the same knots as our comrades.
We avoid the buses we see around us.
It is possible that this is why they took the commission from Ragnari Kjartansson to the sculptor only with pleasure, although it would probably be unusual.
Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, has contacted us and asks if we can come for dessert with her, Ragnar's wife Ingibjörg and Ragnar's husband, at Snaps.
They accepted the invitation, met the three at Snap's, and had dessert wine and dessert for each other.
They followed Ragnar's lead in his plans for an art exhibition that he planned to put on display at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris this autumn.
He had a video series called Scenes from Western Culture.
He explained it in simple terms.
Ásrún says that he described the work as a banal and decadent expression of the everyday life of Westerners.
He had sketches of all the nerves he was going to shoot and lastly he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in.
The scene Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show a young couple making love in a minimalist room.
"These are interactions with a beginning and an end", says Atli.
The pair didn't know Ragnar very well, but they knew him, and he knew them. But they knew us, and they thought we were a good fit.
They had a reputation for not wanting to advertise to people.
Maybe they thought they weren't getting the right people, but people who would get a sexual exemption from performing for others.
They angered Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
When we were leaving Snaps, we said, "Aren't we just made for this?"
It was just the way it was.
"I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team", says Ásrún and Atli takes over.
It's about love and intimacy.
Senan was raised in a nice apartment on Mýrarg Street.
There was a very tight film crew; the cinematographer, Ragnar and the sound man and the couple.
After the fire had been set, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
We had not decided what we should be like.
We got some little instructions, but we tried to forget the time and the place.
To be unconcerned about what we do and for whom.
It was not a game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated", says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic", says Atli, and Aasrún agrees.
We were offered a glass of champagne before they left the room.
It was like a vacation in a fancy hotel in Paris.
The audience was delighted with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi, the doctor, saw this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful", says Atli.
"It's about love and intimacy as much as the interactions themselves", says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard his son's voice at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
Then she turns around and starts to piss in it, says Atli.
Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but then my dad texted me and said, "Gan, to meet the little family in the Palais de Tokyo", he reminded Assun.
And did his involvement in the project deepen the relationship between Asruni and Atla?
At least we're still together, so maybe it's deeper than that.
"At least it deepened my relationship with my in-laws", Asrún says with a laugh.
Asruun himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
"I found it a little hard to be with someone other than you", she says, turning to her husband.
But it was fun to see this because it's just one piece in a much larger piece and when you saw it with the other pieces it's really beautiful.
I could kind of pull myself away from it and just be proud.
"I was pregnant with the couple's second child when the baby was taken out", says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child.
That was just beautiful.
Anna Marsibil Clausen interviewed them with Ásrúnu and Atla in the series Ástarsögur on Channel 1
Swansea with a win in the first play-off
Swansea beat Brentford 1-0 in a dramatic game.
This was the first match of the qualifying round of the Champions League.
The match was played at Swansea Stadium in Wales.
The score in the semi-final was 0-0.
The home side of Swansea took the lead in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the bowling ball off the winning point and defended himself.
Just two minutes later, Brentford's Rico Henry got the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game with one less man and in the 82nd minute Swansea's players saw the difference.
Andre Ayew then added to the vitriol by scoring a superb goal to secure Swansea's 1-0 victory.
Swansea are 1-0 up in the one-off, with the second leg taking place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Without an ambassador for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he requested an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the president of the United States to appoint an ambassador to this country.
Since the resignation of Carol Van Voorst as US Ambassador in April 2009, there has been no ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under special circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falklands Medal.
While on her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a phone call from the president's office, saying that she would not be ashamed of the speech.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until the successor of Van Voorst took office in September 2010.
This may be partly because Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador but then resigned.
The job was taken by Loius Ariega, who had worked in the Foreign Service for decades.
He resigned in the fall of 2013 and took up his post as Ambassador to Guatemala.
And so began another era without ambassadors.
Robert Barber was confirmed by the United States Senate in January 2015 and took office shortly thereafter, but had not had an ambassador in 13 months.
Barber was a political appointee rather than a diplomat, having served as a lawyer and campaign finance aide to Barack Obama.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is the custom for a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual in appointing both an ambassador and high-ranking officials to the Washington administration.
It was two years before the United States Congress called Jeffrey Ross Gunter to testify and confirm that he was the ambassador to Iceland.
In his parliamentary testimony he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, would have been from the Dutch mountain.
Gunter is a political appointee, a former dermatologist in California, and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson started the organization, but Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, but at the time there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest such period in the country.
This is due to both the length of time the Trump administration has been nominating people to the White House and the fact that in recent years, the work of the United States Congress has been very long, including confirming ambassadors.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of roads for the mission, which opened a new headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction cost is estimated at $6.5 billion, but the building is surrounded by thick concrete walls and glass windows.
However, this does not seem to have been enough to satisfy the current ambassador's security needs, for he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player was racially abused in Iceland - It was a mistake to come to Iceland
Former IBV player Tonny Mawejje says he was racially abused while in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny that appeared in the Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, a team in the Uganda Premier League.
In an interview with Daily Monitor Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland when he played with ÍBV, Val and Þrótti in Iceland.
When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle like I used to play.
The team manager was in that position, but he also had the number of the shirt I wanted, so I didn't get any of what I wanted", says Tonny, who played right wing during the season with ÍBV.
Among the things Tonny discusses is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
It happened to me once, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I learned about the case and asked my friend what it was about.
He told me that my opponent had racially criticized me after I had beaten him.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
In it, he says that he has made the mistakes he most regrets.
Tonny had not managed to make it to the first team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but then he joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to have", says Tonny, who hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably come back.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has destroyed his dreams of becoming a great European player.
Found a snake in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 inch long black worm in the throat of a woman who went to the hospital.
A doctor pulled the snake out with a rope.
An examination revealed that the parasites were the ones involved.
CNN is reporting on this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is a type of stew.
The woman was immediately healed after the worm was removed, but parasites aboard these often occur in gray meat or fish.
Since sushi became widespread in the West, cases of parasites infecting people have increased, reports CNN.
Fears of another wave in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight due to concerns about a second wave of coronavirus in Europe, but the authorities have taken action to restart the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been suspended for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are rising.
Other European countries have also taken action to deal with the spread of infection in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to be cautious when returning from Spain, as in Norway, and French people have been warned against travelling to Spain.
Infections are also re-emerging in France and Germany, as governments try to find a balance between containing the spread of the virus and reviving the economy.
Europe, however, is doing well compared to the rest of the world, with new infections worldwide approaching 300,000 a day, with the highest numbers in the Americas and South Asia.
The number of cases worldwide has reached 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the number of confirmed deaths from the virus has reached 644,000.
Moses's Work Finally Fully Reaped
In front of the Reykjavik Customs House is a large and deep hole.
Above it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more miniature work bikes.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the corridor is narrow, and many now stop to admire the mosaic artwork - made of millions of mosaics - as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least, not in his imagination.
The work has been quite hidden, right in front of the parking lot, which was always moving.
People would lay there, load their cars, and then hurry off to do their business in the city center.
The vibrant and diverse public spaces and attractive city streets are the guiding light for the reconstruction of the Safe Harbor that is currently underway.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow the Gerda Helgadott's mosaic on the Toll House to enjoy the view better.
A square will be laid out in front of the project, and the area, with its sunny location, is considered suitable as a place for travelers to stay.
The artwork is illuminated, and the material is now enjoyed more than ever on this 400-square-foot [142-square-meter] floor.
The site will also have small 'water-sculptures', which will provide a playful atmosphere and give the site a certain ambience.
The renovation is being carried out by the City of Reykjavík together with the City of Veitum.
The water, heat and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them are old, but the school policy and the Cold Water Act date back to 1925 and have served downtown residents and businesses for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened, the cars will be able to drive around it again.
However, it will be built in one step, creating a quieter and more accessible space for walking.
The website of the Customs Commissioner's Office states that the building was commissioned in 1971 and that its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the seaweed that penetrated the house, a 250-square-foot [1,800 sq m] wall of glass-free windows was formed, projecting out onto the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such tiles would have a detrimental effect on the overall appearance of the building, unless special measures were taken to beautify the appearance of the building.
So the participants agreed to consider putting up a permanent work of art.
At that time, the artistic movement of Gerda Helgadóttir was in full swing, says the summary.
She has worked extensively on mosaic art in Germany and beyond.
The suggestion was to contact her before deciding whether to put the work up for competition.
It had often been said that the work should reflect the life of the harbour, as the harbour had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik since it was created.
When the artist was interviewed, she was forced to abandon the idea of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from abroad, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerard was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she presented some suggestions for discussion.
She was promptly accepted for the job.
She was also asked to make a full-time contract with the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, with whom she had long worked on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
The contract was struck and Gerard won the artwork under the installation in the brothers' workshop, who then oversaw the installation at the Customs House.
The entire project was extremely well done, both by Gerda Helgadott and the Oidtmann brothers, the summary says.
Since then, it has withstood the harsh Icelandic weather.
The work, which took about two years to complete, was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll House was completed, at the age of just 47.
Supporting the transfer of more agencies to the offshore sector
Social Affairs Minister Ásmundur Einar Daðson has called for more public institutions to be relocated to the country in the near future.
This is what a minister said on the show "Blast" on the Today show.
Recently, it was announced that the Housing and Human Resources Department's fire department will be relocated north to Sauðárkrók this fall.
Six experts in the field of burnishing work at the agency, but none of them are planning to follow the agency north and the National Association of Fire and Ambulance Workers has criticized the transport of livestock.
I think we should take this creature one step further.
I'm preparing the next step in this creature.
"Further transfers", said the Ass.
He said he was convinced that a large majority of the nation would like to see more distribution of public institutions across the country.
'I think we need to take more political decisions on the transfer of public functions to the shore, as I was doing with the Housing and Works Agency,' said Ásmundur, but he also took the example of other agencies that have been transferred to the shore and created a lot of importance for communities abroad, such as the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfoss, the Icelandic National Assembly to Akranes and the industrial insurance on Skagå.
All the highlights from the second day of the Championships
The 94th Icelandic Championships in freestyle ended today at Þórsvellir in Akureyri.
Some of the challenges were set on the second day of the competition.
The women's pole vault was an exciting event in Þórsvell, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in the women's pole vault in 2014, which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR broke the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship back earlier this summer and has been in fantastic form up to the last minute, but she has tripled the Icelandic Championship what is summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been battling injuries and has not caught on today.
She had only one shot out of five, a throw of 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest throw of all time today, or 60.08 metres in her final attempt and set an all-time record.
Her national record, set earlier in July, is 62.69 metres, which was still far short.
The second best throw of the day was by Irishwoman Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir, who improved her personal best by throwing 50.18 metres.
In the men's category, the FH-ing Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic champion in the sluggest, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his second last throw and set a record.
His national record in the event is 75.26 meters.
Gudni Valur Guðnason, Olympic and Icelandic champion in the rings, won a tournament in the bowling tournament at Þórsvell yesterday, but today he competed in the rings, which is his main discipline.
Iceland's Guðna Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest throw of 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Vald Himarjalti Erlendsson was the next-longest today, but he had one throw-in-the-goal that made him second, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic long-distance skier, won the long-distance skiing competition with a clear victory, but Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200 metres, the Irish runner Gudbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir was the fastest, but she came in at 24.04 seconds, while her national record in the event is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jóna was victorious at Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meter sprint and in the 4 x 100 meter relay, and then also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score in the 200 metres race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelssyni from Ármann.
Like Gudbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Can't be fined for 27 million Bitcoin fraud
The IRS has rejected a claim by the tax inspector that a man was fined for misrepresenting his financial income from the sale of the Bitcoin coin.
The committee finds that the tax inspector did not provide a clear rationale for the need to charge the man.
The Commission's ruling states that the tax inspector found the man to have materially misstated tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 tax years.
He had overstated his financial gain from the sale of the Bitcoin electricity of 27 million, either intentionally or by a spectacular recklessness.
The man's a cult for his behavior.
The man refused in a letter to the committee.
He did, however, admit to selling 27 million worth of electronic coins in 2016.
He had a diagnosis in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a standard home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax consequences of such a sale had been very vague and unpredictable.
It would have been reasonable to expect that ordinary citizens would have been aware of such arrangements at the tax office.
He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and would have counted his wealth in the future as an interest on the exchange.
He had consulted both experts and the tax collector to find out how this was done, but to no avail.
He then felt that he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would thus be in a worse position than others to learn complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view of.
So the man felt that his taxes for those two years of income should be recalculated and a penalty applied, but not a punishment.
He then claimed that he was born in Iceland and had paid taxes in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to shirk his duties in an unreasonable way.
The demand for a penalty would be too great and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur is a public figure: "This man knows what football is"
Andersen Willumsson has been a huge hit with the public, but also impressed by his performance as a player with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
The Blacks will be in the firing line tonight as they host the IA live on Channel 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes the toy out for four reminders during the game and does not face it with a new haircut as in the games of the summer until now.
He had written bla, bla, bla on his neck for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 10.
I don't know who he was paying exactly, but speaking of character, he was trying to play.
He didn't go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone to even this game then I thought he would do it or make it up, "said Guðmundur Benediktsson in Pepsi Max's stunt, when Brynjólfi was mentioned.
I'm supposed to be here for the people.
It's hard to know where he stands sometimes.
He looks a bit left-footed when it comes to the game, but he has a very free-wheeling side", said Hjörvar Hafliðson.
Thorell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and is happy to have such a colourful man in the league: "No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love this with his hair, and being always ready to go and answer interviews.
There's an incredible amount of people who are taken by him, which tells me that this man understands what football is.
I'm a distraction from the world.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and have fun with it.
People are reading Brynjólf's interviews, people are paying attention to what's next on his head.
"This man is just a genius", said Mary.
A player from KR says he wants to leave the club -  I have been in contact with some teams in the B-League
Tobias Thomsen, a player in the KR Pepsi Max League, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish newspaper Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to start the season in his home country, but for that he first needs to cancel his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding", Tobias told Bold.
 I have been in contact with several teams in the B-League and will probably switch before the end of the Slovenian season.
There aren't many clubs in Denmark that can afford to pay for my contract with KR.
He then says that he will probably have to accept a reduction in his salary in Denmark.
 Companies in Denmark have probably suffered more from the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.
Bjartmar, a cyclist, has reclaimed his bike for millions - now answers for himself according to a survey
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He rescues lost and stolen bicycles, scooters, and rackets.
Bjartmar has earned the nickname "the bicycle thief" for his work.
Yesterday, a report about his interaction with Bjartmar was published.
DV then pointed to a discussion on Facebook by a group of Westerners, who said that Bjartmar had taken the man to the East and said the sword was possibly stolen.
The original records of the electrician's work only indicated that Bjartmar recognized him as a thief.
This text has now been changed on Facebook and the original news story has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial reports of the case do not at all reflect what actually happened yesterday on the Eastern Front.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victims of electric shocks that these were indeed his electric shocks.
The information was obtained by the alleged owner from someone else, but the information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
I looked at the man and I examined the shuttle, finding information that there was an electrical outlet that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to go on the scooter, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his guilt, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
I usually handle such matters well, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word.
Bjartmar says that the man at the electric scooter asked him to show him the receipt for the bicycle and called the police himself.
"Well, great", Bjartmar said, "let's just get this straight".
The owner of the electric scooter then claimed ownership of his scooter and set off.
Later, the owner of the electrical appliance shared his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
In the more than a year that Bjartmar has devoted to this practice, he says he can count the changes he has made to people on the fingers of other hands.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavik", Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are the least respected members of society, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the street for whatever reason.
"The thief is a tough landlord and somehow he has to finance the next batch, because unfortunately theft of such loose funds is an easy way to that goal", says Bjartmar.
My interaction with these people is actually so good that I've brought a lot of the good people with me.
"I have had people go to therapy and take care of themselves and come to me and help me with what I'm doing", he says.
Bjartmar's interactions with cyclists are generally of a courtesy nature.
Some know of him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, license plates, and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has received little attention.
Bjartmar further says that the police have even begun to point people at him from the back of their bicycles.
Bjartmar is displeased with the previous news release of DV and claims not to be some self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked whether he has not yet come to the surface with his activity, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
Of course, the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this.
I have to film watching the police drive away from a big swarm of stolen bikes.
She is clearly unbiased on these issues.
"When the law is doing nothing about it, and it's just right in front of you, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this category, why not?" asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has been so successful in keeping the bikes on the bike that sometimes he finds his "milestones" on the street that they just have to get the Bjartmari bike they had previously gotten on.
The number of times Bjartmar has called for police assistance has meant that she has not come at all.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the bike owners' fault", Bjartmar said, lamenting that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from the police's lack of attention in this area.
There is no question about the success of Bjartmar.
There are also stories of people thanking Bjartmari for returning their belongings to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the sums are certainly in the millions, if not millions.
Electric scooters, electric bikes, and electric scooters are heavy, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works one day at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works at a shelter.
His wheelchair is thus a paid job he does in his spare time.
Life Insurance and Long Shadows
2019 was a big anniversary year in the history of life insurance funds in Iceland.
Officials had been receiving pensions from the Danish Crown since the 19th century, but in 1919 the civil servants' pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all civil servants.
The foundation for the current pension funds for general wage earners was then laid by general voluntary agreements on the labour market in 1969, which called for an occupational pension fund with a mandatory contribution and a full fundraising from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974 legislation was enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the welfare system continued to improve thereafter.
The welfare of wage earners was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century brought about by its electoral campaign.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly obtained in the historic strike of 1955, and the unions also gradually advanced their demands for sickness and disability benefits, substantial war rights, shorter work hours, housing reforms, and much more.
All these rights were fought for with great vigour, but in retrospect proved to be much more substantial and lasting than the increase in the wage bill, which disappeared with the rapid inflation that marked the post-war period until 1990, as many remember.
The process of establishing the general welfare fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would be the de facto property of the members, the labour movement insisted that their boards should be composed of representatives of both the industry and the membership.
In the years following the creation of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers in the board of directors of the funds was often discussed in the organizations of salary earners, but it never came to fruition, and so we still sit with the unusual prejudice that representatives of the fund companies are not in the majority in the board of directors of the funds.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the liability insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in Article 1 that 'an animal welfare fund shall have as its guiding principle the interests of the members of the fund.'
Chapter 5 also states: 'A pension fund shall set ethical standards for its investments.'
The capital rules of the Lifeline Merchant Fund include, among others, the following provisions, in continuation of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Fund is a member of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the Western Hemisphere and in Europe.
The rules address how a focus on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improved investment experience in securities markets.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context are brought together.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock exchange, adopt a public policy: to maintain good governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gildi Lifeline Fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has adopted a 'responsible investment policy' with similar provisions.
This is all discussed here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic buzzword, "Show management".
Since the term is new to the subject, it is not expected to have been defined in a hurry, but the following definition seems to me to be the most common: Shadow management is when a chairman of a holding company says in the media that he intends to send a recommendation or instruction to the company's representatives on the board of a pension fund on how they should take a stand on a particular matter.
If they don't follow the instructions, they'll be taken out of control at the first convenience.
But if the manager doesn't take it to the media and doesn't talk about the fund, then it's not really "shadow management", because of course, there's always this kind of human interaction in the financial world, just like everywhere else.
I leave it to the reader to consider which way he finds more convenient.
There are two people in particular who have been trying to shape this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at the newspaper Fréttabladet, and Ásgeir Jónsson, the president of the bank.
The two men's complaints were made after Icelandair's CEO, Bogi Nils Bogason, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with airlines and airline hijackers, and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Association of Merchants, sent a recommendation to the association's representatives on the board of the Lifeyrissjóð of merchants not to support the possible trading fund on the company's shares, or else they would be let go.
Sometime later, Bogi Nils reversed his decision and Ragnar Thor followed suit with his recommendations, which were, of course, focused on Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw reason to report the matter in the Fridays' Fréttablad newspaper with big words about shadow government, crime and the need for changes in the law.
There, a small cloud would certainly have overwhelmed the heavy cloud, even though the blessed cloud had been in a state of disarray and had been quickly dried up.
Since this is important, let us consider the matter at hand at the end.
I have previously set out the relevant provisions of the Life Insurance Act.
These include that the fund's board must look after the interests of the fund's members and have ethical standards in investments, and these items are elaborated in the agreements of both Gildis and the Lifeyrissääsääti as I mentioned.
However, life insurance funds should NOT look solely at short-term return prospects in their investments.
Such a course would be very dangerous, and one need not look far to see such in the past, when large loans from banks and foundations have been made to unscrupulous adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The Icelandair CEO was clearly wrong when he came up with the idea of wiping out the entire team of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill enjoyed by the company in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he was able to pull it off.
Time will tell whether investing in a life insurance fund in the company will be considered liable to the mutual funds when it is established.

One of the infected did not have a home-coming problem
One of the three people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the country yesterday arrived from the Baltic states on 15 July last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic national who, although not a permanent resident, was not given clear instructions to maintain a so-called homecoming committee after arriving in Iceland and to go to another exhibition a few days after arriving.
He got a negative from a border patrol.
But he is in an Icelandic community and really should go to that resort, says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the emergency department of Landlækni and the temporary emergency department while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with the news today.
 He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the course and if the course is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the next sample.
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad, but because of his connections to the country as an Icelander he should have used the Icelandic one instead.
He did not realize this, however.
If the class is not registered, you will need to look for it yourself to come to the next demonstration.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to realize that this was the right course to take", says Kamilla.
So it's clear that we need to increase the information flow on this while we find some way to make it automatically that Icelanders don't register their educational credentials.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system, she explains.
Fortunately, the person concerned is not allowed to enter the country, although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, a permanent resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to the emergency room since he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six were consistent with him.
They are yet to be tested, but two of them have begun to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man got a negative from his border patrol on July 15.
Kamilla likely says that he was recently infected with the virus that it could not yet be detected in him when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not exclude the possibility that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not bring the virus with him.
 It's not entirely possible to argue that this is definitely an imported infection because it's been so long since he came to this country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have been exerting a little control in relation to the sporting event.
However, she says that this is highly unlikely because of the man's unknown status.
"It's very unlikely", says Kamilla, but she notes that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in the man.
If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that he brought it into the country.
Pepper spray and bombs used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and unexploded grenades against protesters, but the protesters broke the sticks and set them on fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were protested across the United States last night, but the Seattle protest was in support of the Portland, Oregon, protest.
In Austin, Texas, a protester was shot dead.
The BBC reports that the attacker has been apprehended.
In Seattle, thousands gathered for a peaceful protest.
A mob then set fire to a construction site and broke the roof of the city's cathedral.
The police subsequently declared the protests to be riotous, and clashes between groups of protesters and police occurred.
In Aurora, Colorado, the most remembered by the protesters was Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police last August.
A car crashed into a group of protesters in the city, but no one was hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in closed street meetings where police separated the group from a group of people who were opposed to the protesters and also carried firearms.
Seventy-five arrests were made in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bartender in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our era
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the manager of Manchester United, does not want to overstate the importance of today's match against Leicester in the final of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea don't lose to Wolves, Solskjaer and his men will finish fifth and miss out on a Champions League place.
They still have a chance to make it to the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We're not at the end of the line.
If we score against Leicester I think people will say we have not had a bad season", Solskjær said.
"But whatever happens, it's not the end of our journey, because we still have a long way to go to catch up with the two teams above us", Solskjær said.
It is clear that the nerves of the people will be calm at 3 pm today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that every other game was being discussed.
If you want to be a Manchester United player, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is built on.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it", said Solskjær.
It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The outlines do not define our era, we have already had many moments that define this era.
"As Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think that overall we are in better shape and will be stronger mentally than last season", Solskjær said.
65,000 cases of the sun's rays
There were 65,490 new cases of coronavirus in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 cases have been confirmed in the Western Hemisphere since the beginning of the pandemic in that country.
The death toll from the virus was 900 yesterday, compared to more than 1,000 deaths per day in the previous four days.
A total of 146,460 deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the number of deaths from the virus will reach 175,000 by August 15, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
Fear of Another Wave of the Pandemic
The Spanish government is now trying to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19 on both Thursday and Friday.
The highest number of detections in a single day since the beginning of May coincides with the start of the Spanish lifting one of Europe's strictest bans on exports.
The ban resulted in the British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to be greeted on their return.
A week ago, Spain was on Britain's list of safe countries.
The situation is particularly bad in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where the government has taken a broader approach to restricting the level of interest rates.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and the old people's homes will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for the 200,000 residents of the province of Segria in western Catalonia.
The UK's decision is expected to have a negative impact on Spain's economy, which is heavily dependent on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the pandemic.
TUI, the UK's largest travel agency, has cancelled all flights scheduled for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are reportedly preparing for a second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to a comprehensive export ban that has devastated the economy.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, for example, has taken it very badly, likening it to a nuclear weapon that he does not want to use.
Then, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said that the nation "could not survive, economically or socially", if a nationwide travel ban were reimposed.
Many advisers hope that the local resources available to the population of a particular town, city, or region will be enough to contain the virus in its next outbreak, should it occur.
Five new cases in Iceland - three inland
Three cases were confirmed yesterday in the country and two more at the border.
Five people were found to be positive for Covid-19 in Iceland yesterday.
The public health department says that one of the infections is related to the one that was detected yesterday at the ReyCUP football game.
He's been sent to solitary and 16 people who were in close contact with him in the cell.
The infected person was involved in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" in the affected city.
Others who were sent to the camp are connected to the man in other ways.
The source of this infection is unknown and a full-scale contagion is underway with the Chief's Infection Team.
The organisers of the ReyCUP have followed the guidelines and rules of emergency medicine and public health that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, footage of the convention yesterday drew attention to the fact that the team members could be seen in a very close-knit group celebrating their team's good performance on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the hosts posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says: "Parents, please respect the rules that contestants will pick up their toys at school".
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it's related to the one that was detected the day before.
The announcement says:  Icelandic genetic testing has sequenced the infection and has revealed a new strain of the virus that has not been detected here before.
The case is also being investigated as a contagion case, and the infected person is in isolation and 12 are in intensive care due to the infection.
The third case in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
He was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He's in solitary now, and six of his associates are in a coma.
Two of them are already showing signs of infection.
In addition, two were found at the border and the results of further investigations such as the engineering of the border crossing are awaited.
Finally, the report states: "The Public Safety Division of the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of the Surgeon General urge people to take precautions and be careful about personal contagion.
If you have any doubt about the symptoms of COVID-19, you will be asked to go to the nearest health centre for a test.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite booked for a shopping holiday - Bones guests other
The campsite at Patreeksfir is booked for the weekend, according to the West Building.
Visitors are advised to check other accommodations.
The station also has several other options, including the West Buildings of Bíldudal, Tálknafjörð, Melanes on Rauðasandi, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík.
There is plenty to do in Patreksfirti this weekend, because, as in the previous year, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentary films, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the lack of camping, we can expect a good turnout this year, if the weather doesn't take into account the string of events that DV said earlier today from a hard-hitting forecast.
But we can expect the worst weather south of here, and hope for the return of Patrick.
The website bb.is was the first to report it, saying that all other accommodations in the city were already booked.
Whole townhouse caves down to the best spot in town
Romanian workers live for free in Dunhaga for 18  20.
Meanwhile, the owners are seeking building permits for the redevelopment, but their bid has been the most successful in the system for the third year in a row.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavik City, a large three-story apartment building stands.
On the ground floor of the building, there is about 2,000 square feet [600 sq m] of retail space.
Behind the building are two-story doors, each containing four rather large apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, although most are over 100.
This house has a history.
It was built in 1959 and has, among others, hosted a video league, the Forestry Institute, the Milk Shop of the Milk Trade, the Joa gun factory, the fish market and recently the University Print.
The house has, so to speak, lost its foolish beauty.
The house is now badly damaged, as shown in the accompanying photographs.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
According to the company register, the owners of D18 ehf. are, among others, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was a supporter of the Borgunar ownership group.
The owners of the Borgunar holding company include Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehv. is an investment company of Gudrunas Helgu Lárusdóttir and her children.
Gudrún also owns one third of the shares in D18 ehf.
Gudrun and her husband, August Gudmundur Sigurðsson, once worked on the construction of Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the building in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been maintained since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since then, though mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighbourhood, one resident says that the house has not been particularly lively in the last year.
This may be because the owners have been looking for years to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been in good shape for a long time.
 It's about time we did something decent with this stain and it's a shame it's come to this. 
He also says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not having taken the time to finish it, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this "lawyer's problem".
"Just do this in consultation with the community around you so you can get started and get it done".
The 'lawyer's case' to which the applicant refers is the organisational process of the case which has been ongoing since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then granted permission to build a floor above the existing apartment building and behind it, a new elevator and a one-story addition plus basement.
The building permit for this project was referred to the Environmental and Resources Committee, which rejected it as unsuitable for subdivision planning and insufficient for the planning of the area.
The City of Reykjavík then started with a project to develop the area and completed it with an advertisement in the Stjórnartíðindum last July.
That scheme was also known and was repealed by the Committee in March 2020.
So by this time, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were in their infancy.
By this time, the house had fallen into disrepair, and the neighbors were getting tired.
When the DV asked the neighbors about the situation, the neighbors' reactions were mixed.
Some had insight into the intentions of the homeowners, others had no insight at all.
Some directed their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily out of spite.
Still others said the parking lot was a mess, but neighbors have used the unused parking lot at Dunhagan 1820 under their vehicles.
One of the plaintiffs in the case said, tired of the administration:
To have to go through the process three times is quite incredible.
It's like the city of Reykjavik couldn't read.
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A memorial to the early phases of the city's administration and the masterminds of the owner and their many years of work, which is now in its infancy.
When a reporter entered the park at 18 Dunhaga, he was blown away by galloping doors and a garbage disposal.
A Playstation computer and a new TV were among the other trash on the earth  victims of Iceland's summer heat.
An open door was in the old office of the University Prince, and there a number of cats of the landed gentry to judge.
Clearly someone has been looking around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and some sheets of geography pages, which were likely to become a book, were added.
The hallways of the apartment building were open and alive.
One reporter was fortunate enough to encounter a resident of one of them.
There, the Romanians were eating potato chips for dinner and invited the reporter in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce corporation.
They've been there for a while, and according to the records, the company paid nothing for the building except for heat and electricity.
Given the condition of the house, it doesn't seem necessary to collect the rent.
From the statements posted in the front yard of the building, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers living there in recent months.
The employment rate has not been anywhere near the Covid-19 situation, as a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction industry and these two industries have been the most efficient in using employment services.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhagh 18 seemed to have a lot of work to do, and the windows and windows were hanging in the common until three o'clock after a long day's work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed well-kept.
When a reporter asked the boys about the room, the cold coldness suddenly became clear: At the best spot in Reykjavik, there is a 1,500-square-meter property in the lower part of the city.
The owners want to turn the house into a condo, and the neighbors want to improve the situation, but they disagree on the definition of "condo".
Between the initial planning of the city, the victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process, and the concurrent decision of the Environmental and Resources Committee, there is a gap between the two.
The house is occupied by Romanian workers, perhaps those who go to improve the situation when the Icelanders stop fighting.

In the fight against obesity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will donate £10 million to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on emergency publications, following his severe illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is expected to launch the campaign, Better Health, on Monday, which will encourage doctors to warn cyclists of their high levels of obesity and will also tackle the growing number of cyclists.
Then, according to British media sources, TV ads for fast-food restaurants will be banned by 9 p.m.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short and long term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use this time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods", said a government spokesman.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put into a medically-induced coma when he contracted coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is believed to have lost so severely.
Women better able to lead the change
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the nation can take towards greater power sharing, transparency and in working against corruption and in the interests of the whole.
We need to start changing gears a little bit now, and who better to lead that change than the part of society that is more likely to be caught in these traps.
"They are women", Helga said.
Women in Iceland are famous for their femininity.
Standing together and being together to lead change.
So it's just up to us to lead this change.
She said she was a little nervous about the focus on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
Then we're not as willing to consider what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they're very aware of their history and they're looking at everything that needs to be done.
It's a cave.
We have to know where we're coming from and know the history and listen.
Listen to the rows of the year-old groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here", said Helga.
She said that women are in many ways good in Iceland, but added that Icelanders, like elsewhere, are built on very masculine values.
She said that politics was about self-interest, dominance and power, which were the forces that perpetuated injustice in all societies.
"Women are now starting this group and coming together and are just getting a little annoyed that the National Assembly is going to step by step overlook this 2012 referendum", she said.
It's these feminine values that we're thinking this out of.
"We have to make sure that we are all on the same page", she said, adding that these values were enshrined in the new Constitution.
"We are a country rich in natural resources, and it is ridiculous that people live in poverty.
It is ridiculous, we can change differently, said Helga.
It is absurd that it is some kind of natural law that women's jobs are always underpaid.
It is absurd that flight attendants and nurses have to stand in line forever just to make a living.
The list of signatories to the new constitution can be signed here via the electronic portal Iceland.
Attempted robbery of a pedestrian in downtown
A man was arrested in downtown last night after threatening a pedestrian and trying to extort money from him.
The police also stopped the production of narcotics in Árba, where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hlídní, where the driver was at a speed of 146 km, where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been disqualified from driving.
The Metropolitan Police had been busy for the night, and over 80 cases were recorded in the police log from 5pm yesterday to 5am this morning.
There was a particularly high volume of noise announcements due to the collision.
The following Saturday night, reports of 11 noisy collisions were widely reported in the police daily.
However, last night 22 noise cases were reported to the police.
Six were put in a holding cell last night.
In the town of Ur, police were called in at night when people started shooting fireworks in the air.
However, they were already avoiding the police when the guard arrived.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunk driving and drug abuse.
Four were arrested for a fight in the city center last night, but one of them was kept in a cell.
Two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the center and the other in the West.
One was brought to the emergency room after he was injured in a trampoline jump in Kopavogue.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who drove a bicycle trailer on the Kjalarnes yesterday.
The wheelchair equipment was, according to the police diary, in "very bad condition" and was parked.
You can stay at Monet's for the shopping holiday.
The house where the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his life is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are on the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cramped, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet first got his inspiration to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone's gonna rent the house, they're gonna have to rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb page, the next free day is a week later, on the Sunday of the shopping weekend, so it might be a good idea for some shopkeepers on vacation to book the painter's house.
Two nights over a shopping weekend cost only $964, or about $130,000, depending on when the Newsletter arrives.
The disease is caused by a virus called H5N1 and is transmitted through the feces of the infected pigs.
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in the country in the last three days, and most of the infected are unaffected.
Dozens have been infected, and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease.
Three people were confirmed with the coronavirus yesterday at the border and two at the border.
An expert at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner says that the increase in the number of domestic deaths does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely in the community.
It's been sequenced from the last outbreak and it's a virus that hasn't been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think it's been circulating in the community for some time.
"This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now", said Kamilla Sigrid Josefsdóttir, a specialist in the field of emergency medicine in the country's public health service.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More tests are being done, but some of those who were in contact with the infected are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"There is no flu and there are fewer respiratory infections, so we can be a little liberal in doing these tests on people who at the time of the flu would have had reason to do something else first", Kamilla said.
The majority of the cleaning is complete, but more may need to be done.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
Has this raised questions about the need for such events?
The public relations director is saying that as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible that the plague was spread at the sports events.
If no more people go into isolation from these individuals after associating with them at these sports events, then we can say that our defenses at the events have worked.
But that has not been established, Kamilla said.
The work of the Public Security Department is under constant review.
We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if it seems appropriate,said Kamilla.
In a week, the number of people in the camps will be reduced to a thousand.
This new situation could affect our motives.
Determined thoughts on cooking - See the recipe by Elisa Hyder
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is a retired basketball player and plays with Val.
She's also a nutritionist, a mother, and a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day, and she usually takes time to prepare a good, nutritious meal.
My normal day starts at 8 am", says Elisa.
 After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before picking up my daughter from kindergarten at about three o'clock.
Elis finds it very rewarding to pick up her daughter early from school.
It's nice to have some time with her before I go to practice the second party.
After a workout, it's nice to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to clear our minds.
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is completing a master's degree in nutrition and knows what is best for her to eat so that she has enough energy for work, school, family, and exercise.
What suits me is a variety of foods that are well-rounded in protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
But I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food, not to categorize food as good or bad, but as nutritious or unnutritious.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
I find it very meditative to be in the kitchen cooking and to be very much involved in it.
I must say, I have confidence in the kitchen, and I believe in my heart that I am a good cook.
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, and a small amount of buttermilk, left to sit overnight.
Top this meal with whatever you have at any time.
Most often it's bananas and boiled mussels & CAFFE.
I'm a big coffee person.
Incredibly bad, but fruit or vegetables, flatbreads, clean skim with banana and muslin, bread with a straw and I could eat hummus with a bowl of stew if that's the way it is.
Lunch: I often enjoy a variety of food-loving salads from the refrigerator, Chinese or barley, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dressing, are some of the things I'm working on.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has saved me many times and then there are 2 breadwinners with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, don't add more to your load.
Example: Give me a carbohydrate-rich exercise, a loaf of bread, a cereal, or a fruit.
Dinner: In my home, fish is very common, or there are some delicious vegetable dishes.
Police and protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of emergency following mass protests in downtown.
Police yesterday used explosives and pepper spray to try to clear a large area occupied by protesters, stretching across several blocks of houses near the city's parliament building.
Police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into a demonstration at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly involving some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say protesters attacked police with rocks, flint, rocket-propelled grenades and other loose objects, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where he was injured.
The Seattle protests, however, were peaceful for a long time.
The bomb was intended to show solidarity with the protestors in Portland, Oregon, where a violent clash between protesters and a heavily armed squad of federal police has recently erupted.
There, as in many cities across the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding an end to it.
Not revoked until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the cancellation of Icelandair's flight discharge, which is due to take effect at the end of the month, will be revoked.
The electronic vote on the Icelandic Airline Association's charter on behalf of Icelandair's charter will close at noon tomorrow.
The chairman of the association, Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, said that he was confident that Icelandair would not make a decision on the resignations until the results of the vote were known.
"It's all very well", says Guðlaug Líney.
No resignations have been withdrawn, this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
And then, of course, people are eager to know if they will have a job after their period.
The case is about a contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19th.
It is expected to run until the end of September 2025 and builds on a contract that airlines had previously voted for.
On 17 July, the board and the board of trustees of the Icelandic Air Transport Association agreed to declare a complete shutdown of Icelandair, and members voted to approve it.
It never came, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to stop negotiating with the airline, cancel all its flights and seek contracts with another airline.
The pilots of the company were to take over the duties of the safety team on board for the time being.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney said it's hard to say.
 People are in a state of shock after the Icelandair operation, when all the airlines were fired and announced that they would be merged with another subsidiary.
"We'll see if it has an effect", she says.
940 female flight attendants were employed by Icelandair at the end of April, but by then 900 of them, about 95%, had been dismissed.
Their notice period is a long one, the three months for those who have a shorter working life, ending around the July-August meeting.
That group includes about 90% of the Icelandic flightless.
What will we do if the deal is not approved?
So we want to continue talking to our constituents.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is denied it is clear that the airline's pretenses have been gone too far.
The vote on the deal is over and Icelandair announces the second quarter settlement tomorrow.
The execution of the new charter agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's second-quarter results will also be released tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company's revenue has dropped by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting process for the Icelandic Civil Aviation Association and the Association of the Trade Union of Iceland began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at noon.
The persons who may vote on the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay membership fees to the airline.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday Icelandair had withdrawn from the talks after the airlines rejected the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had then cancelled all its flights and crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new charter agreement was signed.
Under a new contract, airline employees must fly five more hours a month for the same base salary.
The core agreement will last until 2025, but it already includes a regulation for pilots and airline operators on how long one-shift flights can be.
The agreement was announced to FFÍ's members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many airline passengers interviewed by the news agency described their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be accepted in order to keep the CFI alive.
The Icelandair's financial results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating income before capital and taxes, is negative by USD 100 to 110 million or approximately ISK 15 billion, according to the emergency financial results.
Icelandair sent Kauföllinni a statement of financial results last Wednesday, which said that the company's revenue for the quarter was about $60 million, or about $1.3 billion.
The cash and cash equivalents were about $154 million at the end of the quarter, or about $1.3 billion.
Icelanders also intend to issue shares in the company in August.
Iceland aims to complete deals with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the IPO.
A new strain rather than a new type
 Now, this just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
"This is not something that has been going on in the country", says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician of the infectious diseases department of the National Hospital, about the reports that a new type of virus has been detected in the country.
Three cases were confirmed yesterday in the country and two at the border.
The man who was infected had been involved in a sports club's social activities during the Rey Cup, but the source of the infection was undetected and the transmission is still ongoing.
Also, a person who arrived in the country on 15 July was found to be infected and two people who were in close contact with him started showing symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, yesterday, an infection related to a virus that was detected the day before and after a sequencing by the Icelandic Genetic Analysis revealed a new strain of the virus that has not been detected here before.
The infection is completed in connection with that infection.
Már points out that this is not a new virus but the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more accurate to speak of a new strain of the virus rather than a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and whether it could say something about the second wave of the pandemic has begun, Már says that as is the case, it is about a lack of talk and it could go so that there will be no more of it.
 However, if there are cases in the country that are not related to the foreign countries and have the same heritage as this particular strain, then the conclusion [about the second wave] could be drawn, but it is untimely to support it, explains Marek.
The Happiness of the Hot Pot
Is the secret of Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot pot?
BBC documentary makers are leading the way in a hilarious video that sheds light on the country's pool and hot-pot culture.
Iceland's bathing culture is unique in the world, and it is said that there are nowhere in the world as many bathing places per capita.
Natural geothermal heat is the basis, but so is the tradition of irrigation.
Although swimming for children was legalized in 1940, older people are still able to use the hot water for health reasons.
Healthcare is portrayed as a fixed component of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, all are equal, regardless of rank or status.
Instead of talking on their cell phones, people talk about personal notes at home and in the spaces or use the analogous power of water: thoughts and the charging of the soul and body.
On the brattan to collect a hundred days to the election
There are 100 days until the American people go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he's still in the running.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's likely candidate, has a huge lead over Trump nationally, according to polls.
According to a new AP poll, a majority of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic is equally unpopular, and more Americans than ever believe the president has been bad at economic policy.
In fact, only 2 out of 10 Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent said they supported Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent said he had been good at his economic policies.
In March, it was 56 percent; in January, 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's approval rating is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump's is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his performance against the Biden threat, pushing so-called cultural issues and promoting policies that are supposed to turn to law and order.
Biden's campaign, however, is working hard to keep the spotlight on Trump and believes there is a good chance of winning the election if the election is really about how Trump has conducted himself over the past four years.
Trump's uncertainty also appears to be about to come down on Republican lawmakers, and the Democrats fear they may even gain a majority in the Senate, which has so far proved to be very tight.
Politico reported earlier that keeping party and candidate tracking comparable and that it is now the Republican Party would receive its highest dividend in decades.
The party suffered a particularly bad showing in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now looks set to continue that trend.
Trump has in recent days tried to scare suburban residents into following his lead, including saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy America's suburbs and push for racial division.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a Barack Obama-era White House policy that was meant to increase diversity in suburbs.
He then urged the US House of Representatives to read an article by the former New York Deputy Governor, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the US House of Representatives and Trump supported it.
Biden will destroy your neighborhood and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better! said the President.
The suburban population of the United States is an increasingly large group of voters.
According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.
Since the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney won a majority of the votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 primaries, his support there has been significantly diminished.
Although there are differences between the two, Biden has been measured to be fifteen percent ahead of Trump in the outcome of the election.
Regis Philbin is dead.
American television personality Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin's career as an actor, presenter, presenter and singer spanned six decades.
He is best known for hosting the popular talk show Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also hosted such shows as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Phil Sabin is the person who has been on American television for the most hours and has received the accolade for that.
He won six Emmy Awards during his career and was nominated 37 times.
A statement from his family said that Philbin died of natural causes.
Numerous colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media over the past 24 hours.
Will the Olympic torch be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that has only been delayed by world wars, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame would be the "light at the end of the tunnel", presumably referring to the global coronavirus pandemic that the world is now going through in unison.
Africans have a year to prepare, and the Japanese government is paying for the delay.
But everyone's got their heads up.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would host the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese delegates were not disappointed.
They laughed and laughed, and eventually Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but was turned down by Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan had to turn the world's attention to themselves.
The Games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year, and will instead begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If we can't hold the games, if the coronavirus becomes too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.
No one wants to think that thought through.
The Olympics are not just any athletic competition.
Nothing is saved, the show must always be magnificent and the effort must be made to top the last play.
The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the results of the selection committee's presentations of the cities.
The more spectacular the presentation, the more likely you are to get the nod.
Tokyo spent $150 million to try to get the 2016 Olympics, or a whopping $20 billion.
The last time, when the 2020 Games were announced, $75 million, or about $10 billion, was put into the promotion.
By 2013, when Tokyo was chosen to host the Games this year, the Japanese government had already allocated $30 billion for the project.
But that amount is a mere drop in the bucket compared with the cost of building the Olympic Village, organizing the games, and generally strengthening the nation's infrastructure to deal with such challenges, prepare for them, and host the Games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be held this week but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
A report by the Japanese government auditor, published late last year, found that the cost was nearly twice that.
It is unlikely that the cost of postponing the games will be fully quantified, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost to the JOC and the Japanese taxpayers could thus run from $15 billion to $30 billion.
The figures are so high that the entire tax revenue of the Icelandic state would only be worth about half of the Olympic Games, at the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are such a momentous event that they have become the subject of much discussion among economists, who try to analyze the numbers and see the benefits and drawbacks of the games.
At the very least, it seems that many have concluded that the Olympics have a lasting, if not a positive, economic impact on the host city.
There are short-term effects, for example, jobs are very crowded for a short time, but for a long time cities are sitting on top of the debt pile and the enormous operating costs of little-used manpower.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is deep in debt because of the 2016 Games and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the large sports facilities that were built for the Games.
The figures for the London 2012 Olympics have been criticized, but they reveal that only 10 percent of those who were employed in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that there was little new work involved.
In general, cities have not been very successful financially in hosting the Olympics because of the high cost of the facilities built for the games.
However, the benefits are likely to be in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic grounds following the Games, which is still highly uncertain about the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether the stadium will be able to accommodate the large number of spectators that usually attend the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that cities deserve, but it is difficult to quantify.
For despite the enormous cost, the pleasure of gambling is not of the kind that can be valued.
But while the exhibition is very large and there is no saving, it is not just about money.
It's the sports teams that are in the foreground.
For some African people, postponing the games is surprisingly welcome.
Australian pentathlon champion and gold medalist Chloe Esposito, for example, is a quadriplegic and would have been out of action this summer but hopes to be fit for the 2021 Games.
So she is one of those athletes who are just more comfortable with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were planning to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, postponement of the Games would in some cases mean that they would retire before the Games.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of strenuous exercise.
Few athletes have captured the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Rio Olympics as much as movie star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been in several interviews in his native United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She intends to the 2021 Games but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although not generally considered to be a long age, it is higher for a leading lady.
"It's a sensitive issue", Biles said with a smile in another interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram when asked if she plans to match her performance in Rio 2016 at the 2021 Games.
"I honestly don't know if I'll still be on top after a whole year of practice", says Biles.
She has previously said that her body can no longer handle the stress of gymnastics.
Nevertheless, she is training for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop practicing suddenly when the pandemic was at its peak and the movie theater was closed.
No exceptions were made for Biles any more than for others while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any more than the others, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like the others.
The basic form is certainly better than that of most people.
We're on a tight schedule right now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We've had a slow start, but we're back on track, and I'll be adding to the exercises as the year goes on.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be played or whether they will be held, but we are practicing, and given that they will be, we cannot help it.
"I have put too much effort into my life to give up on the sport now", says Biles.
She, like many others, is blind to the possibility, or perhaps more likely to the possibility, that the Games will not be held in 2021 at all.
To predict that is hopeless, however.
No one can predict what the state of the global coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held in the year.
Maybe the Olympic torch will be the light at the end of the Covid corridor.
A Marriage Delayed by the Plague
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other things that are more important to think about right now", the actress told People.
We would love to get married someday and have that dream wedding and have all the people who love us there.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what's important right now, which is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying indoors.
I'm more into homecoming than wedding parties these days.
There is a lot going on, and we should be paying attention to what is happening in the world.
