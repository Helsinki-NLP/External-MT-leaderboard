How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
He's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with fleas.
I feel safe.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20.
It's a beautiful picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Does Tom work here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being so sarcastic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had a good time.
She's not being honest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got irritated.
I'm old now.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought an English book in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Get out of here, everybody.
Giant pandas only live in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say that stuff.
It's getting worse.

You did good here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm just relaxed.

We leave Boston in the morning.
We can't leave you there.

Stop whining.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We are waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
He's good at this game, isn't he?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem too surprising.
I don't go to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is a cheat, isn't he?
Is this cage meant to protect you from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I used to play the trombone when I was younger.
I'm loyal to you.
Can you write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why are you trying to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to get more active.
Are Tom and Mary joking?
She broke out of smoke.
I have no other choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What are you doing this summer?
He got irritated.
Do you speak Shanghaiese?
It shrank because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was it paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
I'm in London?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This is going to make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead by sunset.
Who's your favorite female rapper?
I greet Tom from me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving so soon?
I'm pretty proud of that.
I can smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
She's a little overweight, isn't she?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
I slept in the car.
Tom and I will go to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income drinking.
Search harder on Google!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does that sound familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Are they going to die?
I really like it.
Are you coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good at it.
How would you change it?
It's snowing today.
He promised to write me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our child alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot whether or not he drinks wine.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. Who will give more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in a hotel.
I didn't grow up like this.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I miss it almost every day.
I'm not going to apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's the deciding factor.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his purse for the car keys.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I suggest you be more careful.
It's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American food.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
It'll be clear in the afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents are there?
He's a good singer, isn't he?
Tom is angry with Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers, the first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom is getting emotional.
I was just scared.
It's a party tomorrow.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy with this.
I appreciate your intuition.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We have to inform Tom.
Tom is still sleeping.
Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use the most?
You lighted the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call them.
That's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Mary's opinions.
She's going to the camp.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When is school over?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd get it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most common fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have something to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue down.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose whatever you want.
I'm in the hospital, I was struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
Turn off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a professor?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I'm not introducing them.
Do you like golf?
I'm sorry I interrupted you the other day.
Can you believe this?
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't good.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
This is a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
A lot of people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I heard Tom is learning to drive.
You know I love you deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I knocked down the branch with an axe.
The minigames are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner, I'll take a walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We're grateful for the music he left us.
It's not that the idea of putting an ammonia appliance in my house is so appealing to me.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop. I'm not a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy you a hat?
I thought Tom would get out alive.
She's pale to the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom is my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountains?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
You are charming.
People drink tea in your country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go and wake them up.
Which tooth hurts?
You have to read between the lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a little baffled by Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe a word you say.
Get the fuck out of here!
Naoko only drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You are vulgar.
Tom is getting better.
We can help you.
They called us.
I think Tom must be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why does this always happen to me?
The birds are catching the ground.
The park is closed on Monday.
You didn't even update the firmware?
I got a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do that now?
All my friends like them.
I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We are Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
You guys coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It's worth a visit to the ruins.
He should be prepared for the worst.
Tom pulled the suitcases out of the trunk.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry. I know.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember his license plate number?
He lied to us.
She has seven children.
Let's hear the music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
That's what happened to me.
He has many friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Are you reading this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be all right, don't worry about it.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget her smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know of any Canadians living in Australia?
Tom is bored, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want Tom to do?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She was supposed to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door closing.
She got him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're stubborn.
I'm not nervous.
You have a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you planning to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with his leap reached the stillness of Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father always gets involved in my private life.
Everybody wants something different.
Tom refused to execute the order.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about your plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about we go for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Do Tom and Mary sing?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Contracting is common in the markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry to bother you.
Tom was looking for his pen.
I don't want him to see this.
How many kidneys does a human have?
A saving money is a earning money.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
She's been through red.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting weird.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
You want me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're a coincidence.
Please, turn down the music.
I'll train Tom for the job.
She watched him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.
The Queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say it again, please.
You're upsetting her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I am learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is cheap, it will soon close its doors if the food doesn't taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What are we supposed to do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You look relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it in a second-hand store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying to me.
She helped him.
Everybody was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates clubs.
Go home now.
Tom told me that Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
No one saw her do it.
Tom hasn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You came too early.
He can speak ten languages.
Come home before it gets dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated French in high school.
Aren't you supposed to be home with your mother?
He has blue eyes and blond hair.
I can't understand that.
Tell him who you are.
My name sounds weird.
I'll never forget that night.
Just add an exclamation point to all your sentences.
Can you see anything in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They are traitors.
I'm going to stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll be there for you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long have you lived in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Have you spoken to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom is a golden boy.
You seem to be wary of ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She makes me puke.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock broke.
I'm not going to wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know any Canadians living in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom isn't angry.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary prepared breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you saying?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
She's got the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying home is not fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account at a bank nearby.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
It was nice to see you.
You don't have to worry about that.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom is talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You are a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a second.
Let's have dinner together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture in.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June's not that far away either.
Why does Tom hate him so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes are wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you gonna leave me?
Tom always liked you.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, don't you?
It wasn't my idea to hire you.
Last night my grandmother missed without suffering.
I know why you're angry with them.
You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can read Spanish easily.
Do I need to use ink?
Don't fall off the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
Can't Tom swim?
Kids usually get up early at Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look so rude?
There's nothing I can do for her.
The father is good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
Everybody believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something before.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have a cough every 30 minutes.
Tom is much older now.
Tom is better.
I think Tom is pessimistic.
You have to help them.
I sometimes write to my mother.
You don't trust anyone.
I regret that I was never nice to him.
Have Tom call me.
It hasn't changed a thing.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too early.
I should have eaten more.
Of the 20 female students, only one has read the book.
To love someone means to see them as God intended them to be.
Don't lie to them.
They live with her?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure George will like this idea.
They're afraid to say it publicly.
Please identify yourself.
You leave us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost it.
I almost dropped the plates.
There's a phone in my room.
Is that serious?
Tom composed the 911.
We're brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week was great.
You want a tray with that?
She doesn't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we fix it?
This is the magazine from last month.
They're not back yet.
She's about your age, isn't she?
He's in the back.
We can't let them die.
It's a nerve.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed behind.
This will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your vacation?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved into the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Have you ever spoken to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you come back from London?
Tom is always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you guys dance.
Tom bowed down for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It sounds so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.

Bob has many books in his room.
They followed Tom.
The ship disappeared on the horizon.

Something was going on.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, right?
Mary accidentally bumped into Tom.
I'm no one's enemy.
I forgot your number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's an error in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to get away?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired. Take him home, please.
May all your wishes come true!
She's already done it.
He's an expert on word processors.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?

Finally, they came to a decision.
Soon we'll run out of oil.
Would you buy it?
I should probably lose some weight.
The patient is in a state of deep amazement.
What did Tom give you for Christmas?
It's very close.
We saw them.
Canada, a country covered in snow and ice eight months a year, inhabited by barbarians, bears and beavers.
Don't come into my room.
Do you hate him so much?
He's a very lucky man.
I really liked that movie!
I feel like I've met that guy before.
I want to join you.
How she's grown!
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
I can't risk it.
This is the window John broke.
He's got choices for you.
I'm a friend of Mike's.
Tom said he didn't want a bride.
How do you interpret poetry?
I have the honor of working with Tom.
He started working.
Oil is plentiful in that country.
You don't have to worry.
I know it sounds silly.
Give me the car key, please.
She's not naked.
I'll show you how it works.
Am I slipping?
Please show me another example.
I cut myself with a knife.
Tom will take care of us.
Where did I put my keys?
Have you ever read the Bible?
We tried everything.
"Look at that!" he said, triumphantly.
I'll give him a piece of advice.
How's your summer vacation going?
I don't like poker at all.
How's your job search going?
I heard Tom was killed.
I was ready to do it.
Tom is a fool.
Mike came back from the library at five.
I didn't vote for Tom.
He was seen crossing the street.
I'm like my brother.
I'll be right there.
Do you really think it's necessary?
Everyone who came along the road was surprised.
- This is it?
Write your name here.
He's very selfish, isn't he?
I could try.
He got lost walking through the woods.
How long are you staying?
Tom and Mary are really jealous, aren't they?
They answered every question.
Please fill the forehead.
I came here to learn.
Drink the medicine.
I can see a pattern.
He was unable to attend the party.
Do you still collect stamps?
It's not for them.
They're both good.
She put her drink on my tuxedo.
Why don't you wear that hat anymore?
The report was soon known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you as bored as I am?
Mary kissed her father on the cheek.
What kind of beer does he have?
We're used to living in a big city.
They're our dearest friends.
In general, the climate of Japan is mild.
I had three exams today.
I had no idea she was coming.
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid enough to worry.
Where do you keep your bottle?
Don't you understand yet?
Can you teach me how to play chess?
What time should I wake you?
There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Layla wondered where Sami was.
Take Tom out.
I was happy at the time.
I told him I wasn't hungry.
Tom is messed up, isn't he?
They said they were embarrassed.
Please, take them.
Please go home.
I like professional wrestling.
Tom is clever.
Don't be so formal, please!
You think that's a clue?
I don't think Tom's jokes are particularly funny.
He does everything very quickly.
Please don't kill me!
I bit my lip.
You're a moralist.
She's always been a hothead.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep.
The relief is instant.
Lida is a close friend of Mary's.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
I hope I'll be there.
I never lied to her.
She ate an apple.
Don't judge people by their looks.
She's jealous.
Okay, right, I know what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom is a bum.
You've been to Berlin before.
You're too young to be in love.
Keep your eyes open.
Where did Tom put my passport?
Now lie down.
He finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
Is there nothing we can do?
The A loves B relationship is not reflective, transitive or symmetrical.
Add more salt to the soup.
You just have to wipe the floor.
Don't give a child more money than he needs.
Tom thinks Mary lied.
I'm not gonna talk about it.
I'm a fucking economist.
Tom wouldn't understand.
You want something to drink?
I'm here to help you.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I heard rumors.
I respected Tom.
So what happened next?
She's ready now.
Go play with him.
Now go brush your teeth.
I can't fire her.
He had a shot of anger.
Don't make any noise while you eat the soup.
Please go to the grocery store and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mr. White has gone to Canada.
Do you think Tom is funny?
She's not sure she's going back to her husband's house.
I'm getting a lot of it right now.
He said he wasn't interested.
What's the note say?
I don't have to answer to you for my actions.
Mr. Gomez didn't apologize for my mistake.
Is he a foreigner?
I think you're perfect.
Let's all send them home.
The thermometer marks three degrees below zero.
Even though Marcel works hard, he earns only Canadian $30,000 a year.
Where did you get them?
Can I have a euro?
Tom was the only one who wasn't eating.
I wouldn't want to do anything against the law.
Evaluate your progress.
How many rides do these buses have about every hour?
She wasn't a very good pianist.
Do you have cats?
Women like men with mustaches.
He fell from the tree.
It'll help with this project.
The tree is sick.
Tom will probably be bored.
It was a good choice.
The frost caused a lot of damage to the crops.
Tom deserves an explanation.
Try to think about it.
Are you ready to learn Klingon?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
I'm gonna pretend this never happened.
Sometimes, a little pride is what we need.
Tom lost his money, his family and his friends.
He lives here all alone.
She convinced me.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you back later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Tom didn't tell you?
He misled me.
Can rabbits swim?
Sami was trying to learn Arabic.
You've gotten taller.
Call my wife.
They'll understand.
She read an article.
She couldn't come because of her illness.
Sometimes she's late for school.
My son is brushing his teeth.
I've always liked this restaurant.
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
Dogs are territorial.
Tom is playing in the park.
Can someone open the door, please?
I was just doing my duty.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Feed the bird.
You know I love Tom, don't you?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
He's coming at noon.
You're a busy person, aren't you?
Tom asked everyone to leave.
I'm very frustrated.
She cried when she heard the terrible news.
I'm afraid it's too late to say no.
You are important.
He convinced his wife not to divorce him.
My answer matches yours.
There's no life without electricity and water.
I'm right, I'm right.
They won't see me without a date.
She kicked her boyfriend out of the house.
Have you ever written a letter to Mary?
He behaves very timidly in his presence.
Tom is spoiled.
It's probably a mistake.
He's a famous painter and should be treated as such.
Our cities create serious pollution problems.
Tom has a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to leave.
I like autumn better than anything else.
Tom is suspicious.
The good news is we'll be able to help you.
I usually take a bath before bed.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We are outraged.
I hope you had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed.
Mary laughed.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
I'm a diligent man.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I'm lucky today.
It looks like a baboon.
"Do you have a dog?" "No".
He has a strange character.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help her.
I wonder why Tom isn't here.
Many people thought he was too young to be president.
Tom wondered if Mary could speak French.
Our train arrived late.
Why is Tom looking at me?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
How is Tom when he's angry?
He's such a lazy man.
Help Tom study.
Do you like to travel?
Do you like Tom?
I don't want to be afraid of Tom anymore.
What keeps you up so late?
You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.
He risked his life to save her.
We can't be friends anymore.
He didn't give me anything.
His father was right.
Tom is very generous.
Did you let Tom kiss you?
How old could your grandfather be?
They're too indebted to get small business loans.
Do you have oranges?
Tom seems upset.
I know you've spent the last three years in prison.
That's the norm.
The office is empty.
He sleeps a lot.
Don't keep it upside down.
We must preserve our peaceful constitution.
This is a man dressed as a woman.
Tom is impassive.
Can you call him?
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
Tom has a two-room house.
Don't say anything stupid!
Give them the keys.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
It's good already.
I think Tom is flexible.
We'll wait for Tom in the lobby.
I made a fool of myself.
It was dangerous.
She was happy with the new dress.
You see this?
Tom has no empathy.
Is Tom busy?
He could die.
It's too much of a dependent on him.
Tom is kind to me.
It's not gonna happen.
Tom is home, but Mary is not.
You forget about him.
You're different.
I wasn't mad.
Tom died.
I know you hate school.
My stepdaughter's daughters have signed up for Facebook.
Sami called Layla for her birthday.
I was very upset with him for being so late.
The princess is wearing a gold crown.
He's still shocked, isn't he?
He's a little jealous.
He weighs over 80 pounds.
You don't drive out of fear of an accident.
Send him that paper.
A couple of red sticks broke.
The train arrived in London.
Do your colleagues like their work?
Where do you think we are?
Thirteen Americans were killed.
I was disfigured.
I have frequently come into contact with foreign students.
I have a very nice girlfriend.
I can't see him anymore.
It's unpredictable.
This underwater watch is a little too expensive.
The torch doesn't light at the base.
Put your books away.
His days are numbered.
Tom does what he likes.
The river flooded the entire region.
You'd better fight sleep.
It's really gross.
I have to go help her.
Sami waited.
I missed his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear that?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.
Tom couldn't control himself.
You never trust Tom.
I don't look anything like Tom.
Our work never ends.
You know Tom likes Mary.
Why was it so slow?
We've seen three wars.
The flowers bloom.
Let's go find them.
Do you study French?
In 1900 he left England and never returned.
Tom is saving money for college.
The city has been abandoned by its inhabitants.
Tom is rich and powerful.
She can't be more than twenty.
Have you read any Agatha Christie books?
He deserves a promotion.
I want you to stay where you are.
Was I really boring?
Are we having pizza?
Tom and Mary visited Scandinavia.
He's the fifth man in line.
I hate watching TV.
Iran is going to send a monkey into space.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
You didn't listen to me.
You convinced me.
Layla left Sami.
You can beat a car?
Tom is not my son-in-law. He's just a friend.
Tom never apologized for what he did to us.
What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Morales are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom is upset.
You shouldn't listen to me.
It doesn't change anything.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're kissing!
I wish he had attended the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question for you.
Tom called at 2:30.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm keeping this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I won't find a mole.
The weather is nice today.
No one cared.
Are you from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together, anything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He's not back.
You better go help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom is in trouble.
I'd like you to take him.
Have you been to Cairo?
She must have gone out.
I'm not worried about you.
What do you want to do for work?
We want to meet him.
Do you like the songs?
Do you really think Tom is honest?
I'm getting married soon.
They added a woman to the committee.
Tom didn't scare me.
I'm working here.
He can't swim.
You can talk to me, you know?
Are you always busy?
Did he tell you what to do?
Don't fuck her up!
How long have you lived in Kobe?
How do you like your new job?
Tom ruined the school.
It wasn't so cold yesterday.
I like Tom very much.
Tom threw up in the bucket.
Sami does not celebrate Halloween.
You'll never see them again.
I tried to contact him.
He made room for an elderly woman on the bus.
What's he doing here?
It's a delicate matter.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
He'll always be there.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand.
I'm getting weak!
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
I never believed him.
I'm not your angel anymore.
Tom probably won't be shy.
He can recite poetry.
She closed a door.
I don't want Tom to do it here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
I can tell you're angry.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
Were you blindfolded?
We're getting help.
This guy tried to kill me.
We arrived in New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, don't be such a fool.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted her.
They all knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom is guilty.
You only have two options.
He seems surprised.
I'll ask around.
I don't remember anything.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
He bought bread.
Tom immediately started working.
Do you like this flower?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
I shouldn't have stayed.
Tom is trying to fix his car.
Do you think Tom is still up?
Why are you giving Tom money?
It could be better.
He really hates this way of thinking.
Don't associate with them.
I speak French.
Here's an even better idea.
We're all done here.
I don't have a plan right now.
He calls him often.
She's a musicologist.
Why are you giving Tom money?
Even the kids know that.
Mary prepared breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one's yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I haven't read any of those books.
Liisa was tired of the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's pernicious, isn't it?
Do you have glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be angry?
Tom will call the cops.
Please fill the forehead.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
He seems honest to me.
Don't turn off the light.
They're still living with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used the serum of truth.
You're allowed to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Give me some of that.
This is Tony.
He's rich, but he's not nice.
Read the book aloud.
I think I'll go get them.
Where did you exchange them?
I asked Tom and Mary for their keys.
He said he'd call me.
He never had a screw in his hand.
I was able to save her.
Do you think Tom is guilty?
Why would we want to punish you?
We're not disappointed.
Your handwriting is illegible.
Do you like Tom's tattoos?
Do you have any books on Armenia?
He's busy as usual.
He called his lawyer.
Are you drunk?
Tom seemed stunned.
I'm tired of singing.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Do you love her?
Tell her we're busy.
Is Tom around?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
No one will know.
You want to do business or not?
He asked for a beer.
