Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers this latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die due to a lightning fall.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of American governments promulgated, from 2009, new laws that hindered the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during 2011 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, those laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the poll and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photographic identity document.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photographic identity document.
It is important to keep in mind that, unlike what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people in the age of voting, do not have any photographed identity documents issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have a photographic identity document.
And there are more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use a photographic identity document issued by their institution.
Furthermore, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs that usually vote for republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
Apparently two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the poll in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have resulted in the rate of registration of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of the Spanish, it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11% of the voters, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have fiercely opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Prosecutor’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage was partially reduced.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states adopted the law that required the presentation of a photographic identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the party character of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that with them it is intended to influence 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Doing the test or not doing it?
In fact, the PSA test presents, sometimes, wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
It is a reason more than enough to make men doubt, already reluctant of themselves, whether or not the detection tests should be done.
Do the test or not?
I asked for advice from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of contagion was detected among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up at the age of 12, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer.All possible options should be offered to him and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not harm long-term life, in which case he should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend doing the test in any case.
But it’s important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite research progress, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly damages people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A promising fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The Food
It also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Carrot products should also be avoided.
Conserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer was observed, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each with his doctor.
“Doing the detection test does not cause cancer.”
Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a great shock last summer, and rightly.
It is believed, in effect, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What’s more, it’s the particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model: our best or “less bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto appear to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely certain.
In any case, we assume that this is Higgs, as the chances of mistaking seem few.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inevitable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too much, because it will end up hurting.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: the Pauli principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, in large part, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other side are the Bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I would emphasize here, are not the exotic beasts we might believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinary banal boson: the photon or the “light particle” that acts as the “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disorder” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" a electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
A more stable area
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field.To activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a little like if it were a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface.
Therefore, it takes an immense particle accelerator such as that of CERN (the great hadron collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don’t: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what “can” all these investigations bring?” asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many are eager to find themselves, as the slightest difference could open a door to a “new physical” that tapes certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, such as it does not offer any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe’s matter (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say it won’t have any.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the labs did not suspect the revolution their work would bring.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who produced the first continuous laser (the first were pushed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine it...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light captor in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this captor now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care.The best way to die.Le Devoir
In his Commission Die in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within this essential domain, there is still a lot to be done.
He tried to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breath of two years.
“They had given me five years of life, but I’ve already lived seven,” she said, walking in her bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where she arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The illness has caused him devastation: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to him, brings him medicines and offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest desire is that they cure my diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man is standing on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“This depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer offer the "healing" care.
The greatest fear of Ms. A., 89, is to die “conscious and drowned.”
But the illness has made her discover her children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more wishes in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And she expects, in the coming days, a last visit from her son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
They are palliative care that is given when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It’s very little, because we all know we’ll end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics no longer have their sugar levels under control.
Death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the deceased’s feet.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family gathering in the yard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"Six months ago, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick with cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to Palliative Care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a sick person reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, are almost exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that large relative shortage in Quebec’s health care that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
“Recently,” she says, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergencies suffering great pains without having done what’s needed to relieve her.
I’m afraid that patients want to die just because they don’t get proper care.”
And in parallel, many oncologists obstinate with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s hopes of survival were already low when she left a weak chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she said.
“H, she had told me there was nothing else to do!”
There is no omnipotent care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for failing to meet their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent when it comes to pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand this part of suffering.
More and more, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to be relieved.”
This reporting was made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from the health research institutes of Canada.
Property scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable “system”, of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and maffians are part.
A “industry” that went too expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system sprayes once we hunt the big media,” ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into malversations linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister at that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved $1 billion in contracts," containing some of its instincts of staying with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already dropped two mayors,” he adds, while hoping to be able to “demonstrate the existing strategies behind individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of interventors, investigators and government analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the “Marteau Squadron” police, which, since 2009, have made Montreal’s “cartel of sewerage” moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial recording of charges of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeated bribery in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal road network engineers and Italian businessmen, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and the wrong during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the ruling liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising campaign for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost inflation of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribery from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating the bills between 30% and 40% in the concept of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately blurring a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has since 2010 opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the campaign money was dirty money
From the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she assures that she pulls "from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits."
He added that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning the wounds but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices don’t repeat.
How to do cleaning.
and regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is especially concerned about the role of the “elected politicians aware of the strategy.”
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, “as long as the electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and funding of the parties: “We cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws.”
If this story embraces the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I move forward day by day at your side.
The technical staff has also helped me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I am not warm.
From my beginnings at the INF Preforming Centre Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I’ve always moved forward in giant steps.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
Every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by a group of supporters like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
of course .
Ancelotti inspires respect to all technicians.
Nowadays, there is no one equal in the Premier League and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be more titles in Paris.
In January I had a very reassuring conversation with him.
I just got out of a number of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first half of the season?
In the Premier League, Lyon took us the lead.
We are still in the embassy.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final eighth with style.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of eighth-finals.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget.
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its means for this project to come to fruition.
Not winning the cup in the Premier League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to make every effort to win this championship title.
In the last season, we didn’t get far.
In May we had a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
With 79 points, we should have been champions.
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year will be the best.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to get it.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It’s normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, they still find things to blame us for is a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are working on a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the final eighth, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been seen "pushed" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
PSG seems to be totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is better to say that we have a “dependence”.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he sets a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of the Premier League.
And he has shown in every team he’s been through that he’s a great player, a world star.
We respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this competition.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
I can play good matches in the team today.
That’s what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have an exemplary behavior today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first month at the head of the Blues?
It is getting results.
They are well placed in the world class.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
I do not want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro Cup.
Didier Deschamps will take the team to Brazil.
Did the match (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to set the bases?
This game gave me confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a game like this in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, the political view is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a convertible virtual currency in dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before reaching around $10 today (the prices are cited on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s not surprising if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, he described bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “which competes with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time bookkeepers, verificators, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins are recorded in the public account book, which is spread across the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction into that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add that complementary line.
It is a phase of file fragmentation, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "tracing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would want to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would become orphan, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and deposited bitcoins have been stolen.
“The fault used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same disadvantage.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, the “gigant rebays” were launched.
“We exchanged $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Their system, Paytunia, equals a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier, in addition, manages your identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to deploy in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It’s enough for them to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to re-evaluate the various risks, now considered high, in the event that this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And then then?
The French troops left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished especially the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee heads in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tayikos.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by the local insurgents, they will no longer be, when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
Convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attacks, watched by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, using government land to resell them as solar land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge U.S. subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived in the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under 25 years old, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is avid for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish brochures presenting a modern world have great admirers across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to govern the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations, however, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the prime minister's position that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, with reference to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has relied on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no dam has been repaired, and no important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig the immense Buddhist site and stay there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls’ schools, children’s schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to “win hearts and spirits” and carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of “civil and military actions” of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous collective interest works and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain locations.
Those works, tasty of obtaining local labor, have helped contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forests, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very tough in those valleys often situated at more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to keep a small civilian aid, well-controlled and coming directly to them.
A Constitution with Forces in Egypt
It’s a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It surprised everyone on Wednesday when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And two years ago Egypt has used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial clutter.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "betray his word" and "pisote the right".
Its supporters say it is a measure to more quickly end the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes ravages across the country.
Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in his favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that that appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote for my text or I hold full powers," powers that are supposed to end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its vast majority, voted on the text yesterday.
The majority of liberals did not attend the meeting.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they believed they could not make their points of view valid.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are funny, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed virtually at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the watch of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced with "norms", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals label it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising trick.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which confers to Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “the people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of the university would be quite less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have been working on that text are not ulemas but universities, some of them formed in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, since the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
“We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent civil judges are competent to rule over all of this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the desire of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Neither will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as human rights associations have called for.
These also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticid.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
This was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to come out last night on television, protests are scheduled for noon.
Supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the Holy Land, the umbilical of the world and a sea of salmon
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptism stack" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus’ miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the filled nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection.
Most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers travel here through the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretory, where the judgment was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Unction and to the place of Jesus’ burial.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Blitz of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then become reality.
A vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are found in the mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who engage in the climb can.
Others can reach this historic summit at the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Until there, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski runs is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You cannot visit them all in one trip.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and around 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings it has paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bad Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish bathrooms with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinaries and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they are bathed even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they are bathed there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a salmon that easily sustains even those who do not know how to swim.
The surroundings of the area are truly beautiful.
People come here to take treatment courses with saltwater, saltwater and curative clay and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put in order their broken nerves.
Playing the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the Jaffa citadel, on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that carry the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
The tourists remember
If you’re traveling to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country around 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly made up of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
In fact, it is from a underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transportation costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transbording for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on cow and lamb meat, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the faláfel, which are molten garbage balls, fruits and vegetables.
On the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
Instead, there are a lot of well-fed cats that “go to their taste” in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The snorkelers love the crowded places and do not reject sweets.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, it costs $15 a day.
And renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those arriving to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds 51% to the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
As MPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law on compulsory examination would bring, timers have already appeared in the country that trade with “false” certificates.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
From December 1, a law comes into force, according to which every working immigrant must undergo an examination to verify their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only to those who intend to work in the service sector, community service institutions, household services and retail.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, examinations will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the exam of the language, if not also the exam of Russian history and the exam of foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply to persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examining centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of the Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to apply for the tests in all cities, now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, managed to ask the press this question many times: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, respond representatives of the Immigration Service, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Víctor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are the immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical check.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find scrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, take a “paid trip” to a frightening and narrow cowboy, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received many complaints from our immigrants.
"They are promised one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised salaries," said Tolib Sharipov, head of the labor immigration department of the Tajikistan Immigration Service.
Don’t be angry, my boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, shoes and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, you recognize them.
“One feels humiliated and inferior.”
However, when it comes to the language law, rights defenders point out an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that getting the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Umed Hushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
“Go, don’t be foolish, buy a painting.”
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several “false” certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by federal immigration officials.
The counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wishing to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, authorities can promise immigrant workers who could not have successfully passed the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low.
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the government’s reaction to recent incidents: shooting during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, in which seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on the possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-hand policy.”
In the network has appeared an open letter, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be given up.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, the Russian criminal lawyer Vasily Lesznikov told the BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during the six months of 2012 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in bodies of the Interior were committed, compared to a total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that a stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to head to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry says the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High Staff.
Screenshot of website that accepts arms orders
The first, "army or military vestige", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon",the ones stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were caused premeditately to cover the shortage,” said a former military official.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their grain of sand.
“Now they have proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the rope to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes handicraft, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the former military.
Where do weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during weapons production and 5% correspond to “illegal archaeology.”
The dependent of one of the arms stores, who asked his name not to be mentioned, says the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
Most often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a batch.
Through some bullshit, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This carries the weapon to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he said.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when you have to comply with the crime discovery plan, they make trial purchases from illegal arms dealers,” adds the dependent.
Like in a luxury boutique.
The seller and the buyer often meet through acquaintances.
“I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me went to the “Begovaya” platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a “shroud” where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I only found out there."
Military commentary Viktor Baranets
“To get a weapon I need a friend who has contacts,” says the store’s dependent. “I have a friend like that, but I don’t trust him much.”
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to get, say, "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked to tell him that a tooth had fallen to his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel sleeves through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me only because he knows I will not delay him.
Newcomers search for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tested himself as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The rules, according to him, have not changed.
They handed him a photo album where there was "no of everything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” the military remembers.
The buyer, according to Baranets’ words, is not offered cat for liebre: everything there can be tasted.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
The sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There, users make their orders and ask questions.
Are they selling to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow," laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictional websites and captures those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the cove, and then to extract coal in Siberia.
Military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make requests.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
“In response, they send you a photo and instructions so that you know where the weapon is hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, the press secretary of the NGO “Right to Weapons.”
Viktor Baranets claims that if an order is made online, one is left without a gun and put in jail.

Makarov for $100
On the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-range chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive artifacts decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the United States are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cash managers at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against low wages paid in Walmart’s supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as “McDonald’s”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy’s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”.
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose forces and rush into its early stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wage increases perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of labor unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, the so-called “Black Friday.” That day, in the United States, the orgia of discounts captured millions of inhabitants, and sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers in the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed piquets of protest alongside leftist unions and activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from pans, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart workers only buy at work.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the words of two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of mount loads or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" demonstrators demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 monthly.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than they spend on salaries now.
If Walmart puts the salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say they are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and that it caused no losses to the corporation.
The “Black Friday” lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers conducted the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the leftist Huffington Post website that "less than five" Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
“Free box!”
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the large Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and then they don’t even give you a sick leave and don’t pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than you in this country.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when a quarter of U.S. teenagers went through McDonald’s and worked there, behind the bars, part-time after school, though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashers and fast food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing them from this right and punishing trade union activists with slanders and dismissals.
However, administration rarely makes life easier.
But, for objective reasons, it’s easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main causes is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordantly
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular the city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it is selling billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast food workers to get the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described by the New York Times, this has been the largest manifestation of this kind in American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
“For now, deceiving the brain isn’t that easy.”
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, has recently been normally perceived mainly through the prisma of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and subsequently, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was clear that for the scientists of the company, glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the study object of your research group?
We dedicate ourselves to person-computer interaction, but we also try to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its vast mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the flat-screen pixels, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
What else does the future tell us?
Although Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, we’re working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The computer world must be liberated from our own, the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more convenient way.
First of all, hell with those foolish virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don’t you think they’re overestimated?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, it remains pending to resolve the privacy issue, since it is not always wanted to let others know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this bottle of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
Usually I just talk.
That will be very difficult to recognize.
That is, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can’t do right now?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide a good depth resolution, which is very important.
If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not in megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this latter point of view, not all current technologies are good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern series-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three “cams”, one of which is actually the infrared emitter and the second is the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible slide sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could solve the problem.
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects alongside other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
My hands feel nothing.
What answers is your team preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth well could be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand as a support for the image.
Capture the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these "images in the air".For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to what one feels if someone was blowing him in the thumbs of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wristbands for the wrist that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
Have you tried to fool your brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems he should feel in the moment he sees something?
That’s a good idea, I haven’t tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he goes to an open space, almost endless.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality attractive for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those pure sociophiles of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city wakes up in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone the mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organiser of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
“Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose red because I’m a fashion designer and I’m dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of no good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Cultural Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I made friends with artists of the new wave, with the subsequent ones being exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was already over.
I went to the theatre for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the letters.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - For me it was important to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a Bohemian club, the St. Petersburg Bohemian house.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought to the project "The Van Gogh ear".
Schnur and his friends sang lightweight songs under the phonogram, wore fitted pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band began playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the Hali-galivskih times.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and customers were there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the poll was made in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it’s not comfortable to work; I’m a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. one can be popular but very little cult.
There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them clearly expresses the current and the occurrence.
I am going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything is embedded and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by the clothes, orienting outwardly, but not inside the person.
And, that person should not even give him a hand, but spit him in the face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We just saw you in the role of urban organiser. - A cult city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
But can art be beautiful?
Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touchful.
We are witnessing the decay of cultures.
Previously, people were grouped in flocks, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simplons wanted another.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I’m not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you like.
Now, each cult hero has its 100 fans.
And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come by thousands!
- They will see the abandoned ones, there the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event go 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. as a result, less management, less money, everything is broken.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When he was young, he made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
They often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that’s another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money only to paint paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
What is missing in St. Petersburg?
Good experts in culture.
There is one concept: culture official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were right, everything was different, kings did not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who correctly evaluate them and pave their way.
The subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
What is St Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is a lot more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is hard for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In my case, this class is very small.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving light in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board depart in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same replacement planet?
There is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been conducted for half a century.
Four generations of orbit-growing weeds did not differ in anything from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979, spider eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under pregnancy conditions.
The result is a normal chicken.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chicken has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
In finding no support, the chickens turned to chance.
And after 10 hours in the newborn there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chickens did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we managed to get the chickens born, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
At first, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
The most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our gauge flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," commented the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just after a year of space flight, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has gone well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more can be said, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new pathways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
Under conditions of zero flotability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates ingravity.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable, although still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on Earth originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother’s amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath pass only 2 weeks.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravity, the force of gravity is necessary.
In pregnancy the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrease very quickly, the capacity of expulsion of the fetus is reduced.
Well, let’s omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth to a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov makes himself this original question.
The child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear a special costume for training, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment, which we will do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in bringing to Earth a disabled person, a person wholly unadapted,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will become a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
NKÚ Chief: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the culprit
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is sluggish.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," so describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither can the president of the government prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks nor require obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, within which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What is exactly?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
Simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurements should be organized, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have united everything and, although the control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences.In general, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more comprehensive", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is confirmed, therefore, that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? what do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely a common control of this type that could contribute to the fact that we would stop investing efforts in the concreation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economy means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid thus enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by the fact of reducing the limit of adjudications means that we are going to get it.
Per because the system is saturated with so much “paperwork” that those who want to look for faults in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits remained as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it a similar office to our NKÚ or is it organized otherwise?
As far as the offices, such as the NKÚ, are concerned, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the competences are to some extent analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, which we here call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately specified what is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
I’m sure not, but I don’t like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If that were not the case, you’t have any benefit from collaborating with our office, don’t you think?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we do ex-post checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing for future controls: we have initiated a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", by which we have passed almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analyzed.
Do you consider that the approval of this law is beneficial, or is it rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations “harden” and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each non-respect in public procurement law meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to tighten the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
How do you get out of this?
We will see where this path leads.
The prime minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, referring to the fact of being autonomous only on paper.
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the office from acting, which has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say, “We change the law and we allow it,” but you can’t say that we will do as if nothing.
In the public procurement law, the regulations are quite strict as to the way in which it should be acted formally.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plates, although most of them are transitable.
In several parts of the Czech Republic the roads feature ice and snow plates.
Although most of the roads are transitable, in some should be extreme caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but presented with ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
In contrast, in the crests of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 highway and first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and sloping.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still tracks with remains of ice and snows.
Attention must be increased on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is danger of frostbite and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, the Road and Highways Directorate reports on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of forming ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the Krkonoše mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow stained in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of Eastern Bohemia, the sky will be today between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable this morning, although extreme caution must be taken and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will oscillate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the road operations control center of the region.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometers 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category roads are wet, so in this case, trams with ice plates are also warned.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less busy roads in the Šumava area.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers who drive to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discharged snow.
After chemical treatment, snow remained in the port of Červenohorské and on the road to Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
“In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will encounter snow half-waste in the direction of Jeseník,” an operator of the Šumper road administration told ČTK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also went to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the slopes of the higher areas are now cleared and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on the forest trams, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec Region
The operators of the northern Bohemia roads have complications in various sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road.In contrast, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the central Czech massive, there are no problems and roads are usually dry.
There were no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night.During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced on the road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to catch up with.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Whom did this idea come to mind?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, canceled".
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, will you be able to hear it at charity concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn’t end.
All three performers will sing at the same time.
The hymns will be linked together simultaneously by special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the videoclip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration arise?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, in addition to organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money collected from the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
Equipped for the barrier-free educational center Studeo, we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Students of the Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay for teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the completion of the works at Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert there are several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to create a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any other “spectacular” action in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and also we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards disabled people and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there is still uncommon for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematize the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things behind us...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want.
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the moment comes when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will begin to change everything really.
Until now, these are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered Jedličkův ústav as an educator, where there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to devote themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a coworker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we’ve gotten away a little bit (laughs).
However, popularity did not come until these last years, am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also to actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also allow quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you plan to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something could be done differently.
The world of the show is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then, it is not just an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Did it help the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and require some discipline.
I think it is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go for two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and something.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many were there at the beginning of the year?
One of them is Lada Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can’t avoid it.
Those who are willing and willing will always find the door open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to fund the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech kronor.
Entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entrance to the Bohemiaticket advance sale option
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years participated in the agency’s project committee.
However, Poland’s journey to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study “Introduction to Cosmonautics”.
The young engineer’s ideas (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld received in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, became later a major pioneer of astronomy and cosmonutics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the hidden side of the moon was named.
Already in 1925 a railway was built in Poland that would be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and neither are the details of the project known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for the launch of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dressing is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the provisional scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile techniques projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, society is first referred to with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and launched for the first time on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets were started in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The RM-34 rocket would have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of height.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
On the Meteor-1A the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, on the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and on the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, with its first air tests started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is necessary to mention also the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the social labor law.
The resolution sparked heated debate in society.
It will be interesting to look at the existing problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unstoppable financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "provokes a drop" of the competitor's price with the aim of making up the largest part of the market and thereby increasing its margin of profits.
A large scale means, for most entrepreneurs, to move production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear.The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
All this situation favors the total disinterest of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damages they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is universally so well known that no specific statistical data is needed.
The scrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital at the disposal of their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is evident especially in the changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This is achieved, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing gaps between rich and poor.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who can’t keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid reaches a million.
In the framework of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this type related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live badly with a terrible salary on the boundary of society, hoping that someday it will reach the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny portion of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say to the fullest that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by entangling in control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness the political march and, therefore, the entire state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The evidence is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in a legislation that is practically reproachable everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bills are passed later in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state was long disintegrating and administrations were forcibly occupied."
In exchange for bribery, unlawfully obtained favors and aid to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and the people went to the polls with the voting applauded in advance"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so that once, because of this disorganisation, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man energetic"... Although Appiános thought of Pompeii, César rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that today’s society is based on disregarded preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without any effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unwavering liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-type democracy, as a definite pause, in anticipation of the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian disasters we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and recent history.
Suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systematic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and that weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel is the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" Sting in his song Fragile reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my children didn’t want wars, there’t be any.” – Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have arisen, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favor of the right to self-defense and encapsulates the Palestinians in the role of terrorists.The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and taxes Israel as a terrorist state.
After all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own way of understanding the subject, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the struggle for power is at the forefront.
In every epoch we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is someone still behind, I don’t know, but I don’t dismiss it): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
of course .
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that they stopped associating their name with serious criminal acts.Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have significant holdings in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild central bank Bank of America, began during the Civil War to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
His desire for world power led them during the years 1859 – 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, awarded with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third was intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), as well as the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than an avant-project for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always lead to a worsening of the situation.If not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian throne heir, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after the outbreak of the First World War, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wares to end tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to conceal a conflicting situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, creating optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.Later, it was enough for them to serve the Germans with the Führer's solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed to guilty, and to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and so well represented the function of the fifth column, which seized the flame and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that sought the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration set the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which he was bound by international bankers at first or if everything he did was part of a plan.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, like in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also internationally.
Where does injustice generate injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its presidents, because, as it happens in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
Israel’s current president B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-established financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"And it obliges all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, let him sum the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student demonstrations occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the destroyed Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive prospects: throwing the shah by the edge could not allow it, since, if it did, it threatened the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified even more with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
Failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which harvested a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which a cover-up story helped an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a superproduction of science fiction.
Combination of genders
The plan drawn by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
So that the lie seemed true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).
We find on one side well-documented sequences of Tehran.In the credit sequence emblematic photographs of the time of the events are shown, which were shaped in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: dressed men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has re-started his career.
The actor, who had been the subject of mocking, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the blank of ironic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, after "Adieu petite, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town.
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Similarly, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is “turning” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events.The introductory sequence of embassy taking is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of dismay and lack of forecast that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on fictional scenes (the impostor team in Tehran’s bazar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a told story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to reality: here it doesn’t all come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unstoppable search for its track turn into madness).
Argo’s weakness is the uncontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it’s a film that can be followed with moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
If it collapses, it will be difficult.
As evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balls, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
“We were reminded after the latest event, the EU has planned to approve a 40 percent share of women in managerial positions in large European companies,” said Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities named is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from better life insurance prices because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people by the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline shadows the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable rise in the price of eggs this year.
It has been criticized for the practical prohibition of using the expression "butterfly" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from the shops.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another mercantile or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters in length in the EU and could not show "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonize national standards not homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the survey could be the last year’s U.S. prescription according to which on inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. refers here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of mattress by children up to 14 years old.
Curious events happen even in our country.
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food provisions on the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum amounts of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Then, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of idea did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have the sea.
We demand compensation from the European Union," declared Jaroslav Palas, then Minister of Agriculture, in the fall of 2004.
He argued with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often blank of criticism, the EU’s regulatory efforts and also a more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to several experts, rather our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also touching the sensitive fiber, like other countries in the Union, of the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always come out victorious from these fights.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of origin of the Olomouc requeson, but had to change the name to the national rhum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and went to be called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
The official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with the world-renowned feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the masapán of the German city of Lübeck or the jam of Parma, already includes, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carpa of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of lupus of Žatec.
As EU protected seas, you can be proud of Pardubice’s gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší boats.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m a fan, says Okamura
How did you come up with the candidacy for the presidential election?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything was well in our country, then I’t be applying.
But I can no longer stand to see how the last twenty years have been robbed in our country, how thieves remain unpunished, tax increases and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility that I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
He has already arrived in the Senate, but soon afterwards he has been on his way to the presidency.
Don’t you give your back to those who voted for you?
I have always said that my presidential candidacy depends on the results of the Senate elections.
Later I specified that if I were elected senator, I would submit my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we stumble on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
This is added to the media, which despises you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I subverted journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your ideas.
He is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
For this, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to recognize the guide’s job as self-employed, and we have achieved it.
The problem lies in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, they are deliberately rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a leftist or a right-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more of a leftist.
It doesn’t matter whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is right or left, I want to unite people.
I will always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also be against bad ideas.
It’s a joke when you say you’re a populist.
Don’t you prove it with what you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
Try to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, there are only signs left.
It cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character that points to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been a success of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I just started in politics and I try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to take things forward myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with one person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, if they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I am on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the establishment representatives.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People have chosen the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check out the untouchable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, I have only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
Do you have no money?
Talk about property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land valued at 25 million, a floor valued at ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of artwork valued at ten million, an Aston Martin valued at about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in my account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream.I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was galantine with women and, at the same time, fought evil and injustice.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don’t want to put too much money on your part.
It is not very convincing.
I don’t have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors proves that there’s not too much interest in my program.
I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator’s salary.
For example, I could not pay my son for the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to earn money, then I’t be a candidate.
So will you continue your business to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I partially abandoned my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will become my replacement in the spring.
The people would want it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
I also need to live from something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I am still winning.
If I were president, I would quit the business.

Architectural study MVRDV demonstrates that true adventures are not just in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "book mountain"- 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passing person who passes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “In addition, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody enters those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fugitive visit, holds the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear represented on euro banknotes in the form of decorated armed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was that the policymakers decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architectural studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for funny buildings at the same time as cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around him and shrunk his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here is my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'.
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros is raised in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and housing buildings.
In early November, the book mountain was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the little city lacking in history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly municipality behind whose white façade one would rather intuit a central dairy, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that this is a book paradise under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massive, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The entirely glassy interior is bright and easy to see, the reckoned brick floor and the elegant lighthouses unambiguously support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can see the banks of the park, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, bookstores are arranged along the façade and in the center an enormous dark room opens up that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put the classic spatial configuration on top and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall coating, parapet and barrier at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more daily shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, in a Frisian farm, we find the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands, a few millimeters thick plastic fabric has been used as a base for sticking the roots of crops.
This is an inexpensive and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts for two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such amounts, to four centimeters thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes colour and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy some delicious Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere at the same time that they maintain the proper atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Al it is hard to believe given its large glassy surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the Book Mountain is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside it.
The enormous wooden fences located in the transversal direction to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the rays of the sun.
This creates a comfortable atmosphere.
The rest is about the automatic wheels.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical information technology worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Likewise, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. she qualifies the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "later soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the time being, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept is silent.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
They are there just to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all the success in that reigning discipline that in specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No matter how young and ignorant he may be.
Finally a starting point to reconstruct your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans should play a more protagonist role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather sharp diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany said it would vote against the proposal to grant Palestinian territories the status of an observer state of the United Nations.
In the end, however, Berlin abstained.
And why ?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the country’s special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the US position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is so.
This is because at this time it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already begun the way toward a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to the countries such as France or Great Britain.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with respect to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not alienate itself from the Arab public opinion or the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it so much importance since it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestine vote?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I don’t think there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
Per with this Germany has managed to cultivate some respect.
After all, all this has only proved that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the US has clearly shown itself in favor of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation that is being lived here, it is obvious that the government cannot publicly defend that stance.
I think the real disparity of opinions does not actually have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the stance of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
This is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in forcing Europe to take a European stance.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship itins with Israel.
This has always been a bitter topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of a major international actor?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it still costs the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a leading actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It’s an old problem and it’s that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not currently cover that void, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more important role.
Even if they don’t like it, if it’s unpleasant to them or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, it’s life!

"Trade protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a well-known brand worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is hidden a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the right.
“It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my desk.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copying in the same way, as has happened to the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also served the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it “Bang Ming Pai” or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan".
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
The Chinese are not guilty.
“It’s detrimental to the business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millions, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury goods and the one that grows at the fastest pace.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of doubtful legality in the trademark registration is complicated and also means a lot of money.
The process can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court rejected a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name the subject of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality”.
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the plaintiff's brand in China," Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer, Geely, initially used a white-and-blue logo that largely resembled BMW; the matter was settled in courts and Geely had to modify it.
Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staff.
Last year, however, “employment emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed complaints has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending resolution.
Fighting it costs a lot of money.
As is common in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.800 million yuan would have been paid in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have caused this because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the appeal from the municipalities.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been given the right, but the opposing side continues to fight at present.
You have to be very careful
The case has now reached the doorstep of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the matter favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the enterprise archive has had to review up to a hundred years old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to affect Europe.
In particular, if imitators are assured there the rights on unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer attempted to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial area, however it managed to prevent the registration.
“We have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is to “register in China everything that can be subject to protection,” as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the theme can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Switzerland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of overcoming far more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and mocassins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three and four.
Only then the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to slowly rise, rattling, and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his boxes by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It’s Monday afternoon and in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
There were also fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Assistance for self-help
According to an estimate from UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Switzerland.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany paddles for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 to 20 euros per month, a child can be adopted.
This donation will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu “story narrator” or “panegirist”.
In this room no one knows how to fluently speak this Bantu language, but they can sing.
For ten years, this choir has been rehearsing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
40% are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and palm boxes, a large part of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at a little over thirty has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main: food, clothes and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial ETS include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral ETSs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Tinnitus and scabies are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute found that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany originated from sexual intercourse between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively scarce; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections hasined a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011 there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you change sexual partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most ETS can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the honoraries that the choir collects for its performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured woman with leadership abilities manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the elderly women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their disposal, offer them a roof to live and take care that children go to school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two chefs who are responsible for cooking every day for over 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chickens and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the inhabitants of the village tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is common throughout the country, it is not common to talk about it openly.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the so rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it’s also due to the countless temporaries that travel the country from side to side and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get condoms for free, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always leads them to Esitjeni, where singers visit the adopted children.
Despite the fact that this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is well known.
“Come closer to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” says the local people.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the Bergheimer Street rehearsal rooms filled with singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
NASA finds ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also ice water, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the planet’s permanently shaded area.
It seems that it is at least 30 centimeters thick and probably even 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one connects the finding of ice with the possibility that life exists on the planet, says Messenger chief investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely unaware for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, the probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a “family portrait” in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue spots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the “newborn” stars.
This region of star formation, unromantically named by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This tornado image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made up of the material that the star sparks in its extinction process.
In the enormous Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galaxy’s star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, colors can be better appreciated.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a land continent has given it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This shadowy star was captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It’s probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Rememberable Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trífida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the candy heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion balance to each other to end up colliding irreparably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Southern Mole.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is made up of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a home.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of the brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars are also continuously emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when most of the hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our Window to the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is being raised.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Canary Large Telescope located on the island of La Palma is enormous – the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radiotelescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of signals of extraterrestrial life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capabilities.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) is the European Extremely Large Telescope.
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be made up of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, we are not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planets candidates had been found since the start of its mission.
The image shows the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers believe that there is ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no credible evidence, as the Messenger spacecraft orbits the planet in a much closer orbit to the North Pole.
For decades, radar measurements have indicated the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger spacecraft, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now sure it is so.
Drink butter every day and live to 168 years

There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be called wild and romantic.
The minibus moves steeply through the winding road that passes alongside forested hills, rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it’s in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, besides that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azerbaijani and that they are very long-lasting.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts of a too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that doesn’t seem to fit entirely in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it needs to have to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the world’s oldest people,” Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis from the place that have exceeded 100 years of age.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the indisputable star of the museum is shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
There is no birth certificate that confirms this.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Muslimov’s age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children and apparently still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov then been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan also live people of very old age,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil record.
Each day full glasses of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many elderly people living here?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink daily a glass of melted butter, is so healthy.
Or it is the natural way of life that keeps people young?In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, he is relatively young for what he is styling on these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, he unremittingly moves a huge barrel of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play with two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in typical glasses with a boiled shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the wig she hides two long tresses of dark blonde hair that her son discovers proudly.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live.
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peanuts.
I have never been shopping at a supermarket in my life.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II period.
However, everything came back to its way when the “beloved father,” Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult professed to the paternal figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded the testimony to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And Mirzayeva’s dull son is right: “In our culture, the elderly are very respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn’t enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is sinking.
The future constitution, with Sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not escape pathetism.
“We need to overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially the Coptic Christians, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secular.
All of them, so far sinking without remedy into a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, he has had to temporarily cancel the Constitutional Court’s powers and expand its own “to save the revolution.”
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you want to deprive the judiciary of your power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the “principles of Islamic law.”
But what does that mean by “principles”?
This was and still remains open to interpretation, and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal margin it has, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to Sharia, it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with a great power across Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be so, but this could mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it wants to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served as a harsh repression against the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morality and values".
It is a formulation so imprecise in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
This is nothing more than censorship.
No article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacy.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offending people"
Is it enough a cartoon of the president or a joke about a writer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be subjected to a referendum.
“The revolution is back.”
For weeks, the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon on Tahrir Square and vowed to fail the Act before it could come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the lists for the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the trash cube of history.”
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup of state against democracy.”
“When he calls for a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atonished," the Egyptian opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community made a call to celebrate a counter-manifestation; not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it shouting: “The people demand the application of divine law.”
They demanded that Mursi “cleanse the country,” while proclaiming: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk that something like this would happen.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now would have come the time to let the people decide in the polls what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has a guaranteed majority.
“The term ‘human rights’ does not even appear”
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were held in prison or faced a trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ doesn’t even appear in the new constitution,” he lamented in a conversation with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers of the state made this lawyer resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda said.
Democracy cannot work without civil society.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A demonstrator at Tahrir Square warns: “You’re conceiving a monster that you can’t control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the world’s most stinking fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has anything to do with its greed for a very bad fish?
Take a number of excessively healed cheeses.
I put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing smell of the rakfisk, one of the exquisites of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is a salad trout that can be fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how odorless you prefer.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians go to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating meal.
“You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the “General of the Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking important amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid spending it near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different from a portion of sushi that you’ve travelled a few kilometers by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, the fish was kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of the winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A current of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be an important part, an essential, though rather illusory, of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive.A cane of beer or a sandwich costs you the friolera of 10€ ($14) each.
Norway doesn’t usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 incident.”
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason why we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she walks through rakfisk plates and who, with her long blonde melena and her surprisingly blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, prudent people.”
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don’t like to boast, we don’t like ostentation.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years that preceded the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet closed.
“While we can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“And eat rakfisk,” he adds with a shrinking scratch.
I’m in the snow making a tail to eat something; I’ve already had enough rakfisk.
Now an alce hamburger is undoubtedly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that bad fish comes back.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many locations where a rakfisk dinner is celebrated in which the comensals vote for the best fish, or the one that most tests the nasal foxes.
A television has connected live with a host who carries bird-cake and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
This is the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
“Here is our score, Havard.”
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyzes the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is bad nowadays.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already by itself congestioned, a steel siege has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplaces, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been gaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is plunged into a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to that goal."
Prior to his engagement with the U.S. president, Mr. Peña’s prior political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populated and fast-growing state, surrounding the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucólica city of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism on the site and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive by one of Mr. Peña Nieto’s new roads, which is an enormous improvement compared to the crushed and filled roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with his name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern multi-sport venue and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We are confident that he can make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of Mr. Peña Nieto’s party, the PRI.
“Particularly, in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and genuine change that our country so needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was banished by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the criticism that the opposition makes of the lack of essence of the new president.
“He’s a very sincere, very committed man with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic state man and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Neza City, the contrast with the dull streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway tracks, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year, military intervention was called for to help in the fight against the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is severe.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of women murdered have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of feminicide while in office.
Most critics accuse their administration of making the fat look.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been cleaned up,” Ms. Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross on which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I was an old whistleblower, a whistleblower, a whistleblower.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and keeps silent.”
“But that can’t be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to prioritize them during his term.
"I hope he is the same type of president he was when he was governor," says the PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning’s allegations of abuse during his stay in prison
The trial centers on Manning's period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be rejected on the basis that Manning’s imprisonment was severe.
The military soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that prosecutors conducted Manning in a pre-trial view in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits by unit officers that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defense’s request to reject the case given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already included sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
On Friday's appearance, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled in after the visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the carpenters as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaint of ill-treatment, despite officials asking Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had talked about those problems and indicated that they would be treated, but that they did not leave evidence of those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but that doesn't necessarily mean I didn't mention any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a council in charge of examining suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the “injury prevention” regime under which he was.
The military said they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below that of possible suicide surveillance, to ensure his protection and the safety of other people.
"I wanted the senior state to know that I was fine and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marines base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world has only been reduced to the Arafjon Camp, to that cage,” Manning explained on Thursday.
“I thought I would die in that cage.”
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of his days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without a companion.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a chancellor, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as he was forbidden to sleep or even sink during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the keepers couldn’t see his face when he was turning around at night, they woke him up so that he could turn back.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the cellars and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the countdown.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the order given to him by the cellar that he should let the blanket with which it could have been covered fall, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he might have used the elastic of his underwear or his chancles to self-injure but that he had not.
Manning testified that night they had removed her underwear, chancles and glasses from her cell.
Her lawyers are hoping that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she went through during her prison stay and reduce her sentence drastically in case she was convicted in the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning declare himself guilty of minor crimes and defend other charges considered too extreme.
The trial is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of the arrest were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of enforcement for all detainees who are under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defense and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-American people are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely descended the terrace and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Posters indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Estrangers".
I stayed there for a few seconds not sure where I was going.
When I grew up in Central California, I’ve been called “Mexican” all my life.
It’s ethnic tachigraphy, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York refer to themselves as “Italians.”
Later I decided for “Mexico-American.”
This was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, tachography or scripts were not needed.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought of that moment this week when Mexico’s elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was eager to talk also about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at this time it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he will venture to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create in North America a trade bloc in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory to the point of a gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, in the moment a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are put on war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about anger?
There is much.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genealogy tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or some of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And, despite the fact that we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is.
It is for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us over our shoulders as if we were from an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they’t have left.
And now we’t find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this fuss between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans because the first know with more solidity who they are and the second this annoys them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they’re not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band The Tigers of the North, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even more, so what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American counterparts how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes of course...
That will not happen.
There is too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galoping corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I am afraid you will be left alone with this idea, friends.
It is fair.
If some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented by how their relatives were treated far less time ago.
Hmmm .
Maybe we’re more “Mexican” than we thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the usual and useless discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, Gaza missiles have fallen near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything done, whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional turmoil.
Per this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal dead-point situation could unravel.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 isined, this week’s clashes have reinforced the falcons on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good palice.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favour.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renewed regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas.
Hamas exhilarating members say the Islamist half-moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn’t have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas cousins and their leaders rely more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As for the military issue, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly... for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that corrupts the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite, according to international law, being illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on January 22, is in a good position.
Why mimic those retorted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, would they not fire rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Per the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab Spring could alter your calculations.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the region’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to the ceasefire is a good augury and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics are worsening the situation as the Arab population grows.
The cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains what sensible people from both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper preach: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small to short-term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to brake arms entry into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category in the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he omitted to present his own plan for peace.
Again at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to pay attention to it.
This attitude presents a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Generic tobacco packaging law enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on green blank bags, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colours of the brands with an envelope of an olive-green shutter, scary images of body parts with diseases and representations of children and babies sick for being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed on a type of small font.
It is the most stringent regulation in the world for tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
Studies have shown that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never.
"It can be seen that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Tanya Plibersek, the federal health minister, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls associated the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exercised enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will bring serious involuntary consequences,” said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited after the passing of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, claimed that demand for silicone pitchers and blankets to cover the unpleasant images from the bags had shot almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a recusation to the law in the Australian Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is aimed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local and websites, but can not restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands coming from “city of foot” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It must be asked if it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the hassle of making a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses more on what the new regulation implies than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being restricted unfairly, despite none of these countries having a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution by mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in the box.
Currently, they are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, harsher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The pictures don’t affect me.
I simply don’t pay attention to them.”
"You take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Honestly, there is only one reason why I would quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in downtown Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to put them on the shelves.
“Normally it took an hour to unfold a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it's, well, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get bored a little.
During Thanksgiving celebrations this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is pretty boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and children’s development experts who praise the goods of boredom.
According to them, it’s good that, both us and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boredness forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
Should we accept boredom?
and yes.
and no .
But we will talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book “Boredom: A Lively History” published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, it is not so.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very diverse ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and putting the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wishing, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you."
The difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
It points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be theirs.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to an all-volume television program in the adjacent room that kept no relationship, others listened to it with low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was difficult for them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, disturbing attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting faulty parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or scratching, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay quiet,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a boring movie.
Some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “trend scale to boredom”.
The scale includes issues such as “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which 400 teenagers and their parents were contacted seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when out of school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would get bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But she said what she knew was that “adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can make us exposed to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Dullness is the way the brain tells you you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s best.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned how to entertain himself or to dosage himself," says Professor Fenske.
And “this ability to dosage applies to other situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns how to entertain himself, but also learns how to control himself better in other areas.
I don’t think we really want to praise boredom.
But we should not be too critical about it either.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable apart from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate to something worthwhile,” he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly over-stimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No instructions book for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and soccer player from southeast Colorado, faces a criminal case for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a court call for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes each involving a fine of $100) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of smaller cases for drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes for marijuana possession are being annulled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against people over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors from Colorado’s more conservative districts have pledged to keep up with cases opened for marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of recently authorized marijuana stores in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses; all this before the deadline, December 1, 2013, arrives.
They say that, for good or bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in regards to regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that can serve as a model for us,” he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, leaving a year for swimming between two waters, as the license system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s demand to offer “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its ban on doing cannabis in a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, children’s playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Oates, the chief of police of Aurora, sent an email to his police officers in which he informed them that the city prosecutor would cease to bring legal actions for minor cases of possession of marijuana to people over 21 and that the police would cease to file charges against those crimes "with immediate effect."
Police chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city’s regulations that regulate the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug dealers and traffickers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has the obligation to bring legal proceedings against those faults that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like the rural County of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
County District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
“I don’t think I’m wasting time on continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana consumption to the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecologist experiment in this state.
“It’s a cultural barrier with district prosecutors,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the accused for marijuana possession and who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time bringing people before the courts that, in reality, they still can’t accept that it’s legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of marijuana sale and cultivation as federal crimes.
Advocates for marijuana legalization have the hope that the Justice Department will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and vendors of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they are likely to be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of recreational marijuana, allowed under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser in the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, although it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
“We don’t want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted against voting for what the state voted for.”
A lot of questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Don’t attack university students for their views just now
I don’t remember a moment in my life that I’ve never dreamed of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I supposed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I took my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a career in History, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had left because I did not tolerate that some college classmates had sex in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in untouched cups.
The truth was less fun.
I fled from there.
Yes, I fled because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what this is now about.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative Party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (graduate student group) of Corpus Christi College say they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in their university’s equal opportunities committee to ensure they can express their opinions freely.
Her situation was not favored by a recent BBC documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Bright and on the Right) about the politics of the students and that presented the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It showed postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lining a silver suit and a stick with the silver fist.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as “Turkish heads” for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, and vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who submitted the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, 19, an elected president of the OUCA, says the attitude of the JCR members towards people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of the members,” he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than the one.
I entered the university in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a "honoris causa" title after the cuts in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere would have shaken any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new college students, when new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors were not only fattened by the moff that was made of the conservative universities, but were willing to participate in it.
The policy of miners’ strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate French texts from the eighteenth century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
“Mrs. Wyatt,” said professor Harry Pitt (already dead), “please translate the first paragraph.”
I do not say one.
Pitt, a small man with a face that looked like biscuit, knew very well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or is it that, simply, they are fools?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes burned with the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest that she go to French classes in her free time, as long as she's not too busy getting to know people," Pitt said.
I went back to my room like a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinner at university; then I felt a slight palm in my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
“I am afraid that this is how things go.
They get involved with anyone who is suspected of being Tory.
It’s very complicated for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’ll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labourists.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.”
Other students adopted this song.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” one asked.
“They give each other a blade, aren’t they?”
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could he ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who think like me only after night?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory lecturer was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
He was hated for being not only of the Conservative party, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches.
He was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started moving daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of more open-minded metropolitan mentality.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He did not believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But if it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
“Give him another chance.
I’m sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you let it go.”
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had given up his credo.
The next week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had insinuated, speaking completely seriously, that I was a “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed me” and called them “old stupid.”
The truce lasted shortly.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was inside shaken by fear and, five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcases and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You may call me a weak cry.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hides behind an unmerited reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of the Costume", which has been inaugurated this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of the Costume", a retrospective apoteosis that brings together more than 130 high costume dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the column of a story whose sole protagonist is “il signore” Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the aristocracy’s greatest grenade, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches those personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the humble modist of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international "jet-set".
Being in love with the kingdom is nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off their pitchers on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she is a star.
Valeria Mazza with Valentine's Day
Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modist.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything his spirit was seen and felt.
“Each one of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the top model, who began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because your designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of Alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-corresponding loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-metre-long passageway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the role of the models and must parade through the passageway to contemplate a dream "audience" that lights up Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the garment she used Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In that manic public there are names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine’s Day is like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" jacket and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he made to me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s musees.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," she added.
I like the colors that they use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergt can never forget the first time she wore a Valentine's Day.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting the age and opportunity to wear one of his night costumes.
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine’s dress to wear at a party at my cousin’s castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flying fist, drapeated "corsage" and a word of honor.
“It was a dream made reality,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D’Arenberg keeps her fashion party dresses with “maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries.”
The “King” of Fashion
The grand final of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding costume at her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “ragazze” (as the modist calls his sewing women) to make that ivory-colored silk suit with pearl incrustations, twelve different types of fit and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high costume of the late 20th century, “the return of the clients of the high society.”
Obfuscated for years with the elite’s “savoir-être”, Valentino is now his best exemplar.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of her clients.
“I have always attracted his refinement, his calmness, his pulcro and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg recognises.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
“He was impeccable, time didn’t pass for him.”
As a princess says.
The world’s toughest job: Kawah Ijen’s human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their job is hell and others who literally work in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the Earth's gut solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After starting out large sulfur rocks, which total about 70 kilograms, he carries them into two baskets of bamboo that loads on his shoulders through sharp roads of stone.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted bearers take more than 40 minutes to rise as a turtle, keeping the balance and measuring their steps with tenderness so as not to slide and fall by the prey.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who dropped years ago for the risks of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once on the top, tourists photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, fatiguingly carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has situated a little lower, at 1.850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make light bulbs, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As it is normal to carry 70 kilos, we take about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," Anto explains, who usually makes three doors a day.
It takes three hours on each and ends molten, but they allow you to put together 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhumane effort, it’s three times what it would earn in the field.
“The miner’s salary is very high here, where coffee harvesting is paid at 15,000 rupees ($1.2) a day and the average monthly salary is 2 million rupees ($167),” explains the carrier, who previously worked as a strawbery on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tax was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto is three playing his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
That’s the price you have to pay to your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this kind and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waitress or hotel receptionist, but instead does the job of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden cabin with other bearers, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to bear at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lights up with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supplies any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at the same time the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) charge per camera that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old bearer who has been at the Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, he says he will work "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and hears the eyes when the wind improvises and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder sores, which have been misformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at his 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues pull out 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the dirt.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that – or maybe because of that – the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like “Let’s put a bao (bowl) in the oven” to laugh at Singapore’s birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
This is something purely of the internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we think, why not do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 The children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the reposition rate – was in 1976.
So why do singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies at the National Population Division, says it’s due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in single people, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping low wages and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and charges for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While the fall in birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The city development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as “shoe boxes”, that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer guidelines for developers, who were previously blocked if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the center’s financial district would seem that they won’t have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and education is too, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Others may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private Offline is Private On Line
and privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or "the area of private life that you have the right to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a child under 16 years old?
How do you apply this definition to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating on the Internet situations that you’t share offline?
The journal interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on the personal level, and “in the key and user name,” when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets’t go into a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” she says.
I uploaded pictures of games or games on FB.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or of someone who’s making the ridicule,” she says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
He has 35 friends on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they will answer me, I just go up,” he added.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
He said he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I would not pay attention to anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of the 14-year-old is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last admits not to know 20 of the people added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressure me or require me to do so, I’ll simply pull them out of my account,” he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The young man is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of my friend was being extortioned on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
“I just gave him privacy.”
Then explain a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I will do it if I get sick or if I get sick.
“But I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and licensed in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed,” he mentions.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He commented that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
“They should also be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he added.
The most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
“Tell them not to do it doesn’t help,” he added.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Would you like someone to post a photo of you like the one you posted to a friend?
Do you know what others say about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, do you all need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act on line as they do off line.
These are the same rules.
“One outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be on social media,” he says.
surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary professor and educational consultant, comments that it is indispensable for family parents to consciously read the policies of social networks.
By understanding each of the incisions they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an Internet account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or post,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
Unasur summit ends without Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assisting presidents.
Efe tried on repeated occasions to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources from the Chancellor and the Presidency pointed out at the beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but afterwards said that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they said the content had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to the summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day only broadcast, in the press room, the no-sound video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted".
The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of assisting presidents, which caused the upset of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's statement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently required by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not spread.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited to the maximum the collection of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling of the Hague Court that resolves a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will catch up and execute the verdict that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala, along with his Chilean mate, said.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals,” Piñera said in a statement.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICC came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact by which it had accepted to submit to the failures of that international court, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence."
He that actions are being pushed to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to low-cost internet in all corners of South America, and to meet jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters.”
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant matrix but must serve to broaden our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reincorporation to the Union of South American Nations," from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan mate, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal with the maritime dispute in a respectful manner following a ruling by the ICC, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega are scheduled to meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met earlier to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are virtually a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
"We must free mobility of citizens and workers through any South American country, as it already happens with the members of the Andes Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The ecuadorian president also stated in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who give a seat never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding," he said in reference to Ecuador's political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his trial was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that it be interrogated on its territory for a alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation allows it to be performed through a videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Mr Correa said Assange’s physical and mental health could deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he’s been in our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” he said.
What is there is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“This complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a lifeguard allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances,” he said.
And he said that “if Britain gives tomorrow the salvoconduct this ends.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem ends.
Correa took advantage of reaffirming himself as a defender of press freedom and nuanced that what he does not tolerate is "medium faith, bad faith and lies, which destroy freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he congratulated that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries who dominate Ecuador," and advanced that if he is re-elected "he will deepen in the revolution to continue the path and the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay’s veto in the Unasur at least until its upcoming elections, arguing that the body “should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d’état revested with legality” because in reality “it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
The ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between both countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this fault is not met.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime borders that Peru and Chile hold in the same court and said that “it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept the ruling no matter how hard it is.”
In reference to the eventuality that he will be presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite tough."
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as that of Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from the political power.
“My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I won, it would be my last term in the presidency and that’s why we’re out of public life.
We lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he travelled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chavez's health," he said.
The head of state of Ecuador participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths are a cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was tested for HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb fell on me," he said, reminding the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care only of his illness and began to report on it; with such determination that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which he came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he brought a cut.”
Having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, still many people arrive when the virus has already caused devastation, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years from the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," indicated the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients present when starting the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that whoever receives the HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25, under these terms "as long as it remains in control will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," the respondent explained.
To measure this advance, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why are there still deaths?
The problem is not access to treatment.
This is what happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a breakdown of medicine the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: “Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, they have to offer massive detection tests to all people who require it.”
In his proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to make the test to a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had done it a friend and, despite his short age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better revive three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, do exercise, take medications.
To date, her parents only know that she has cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but I am responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio said, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them do the test, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
This, its message, summarizes the motto of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the display
Large are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatío journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
The most important is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us a hundred packages, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorrow and value judgments from social workers, school orienters, pharmacy employees and healthcare staff, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not be just behind the tablespoons and that those hundred should be in public bathroom outlets of the sites that young people frequent.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for the chiles and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
“This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity,” he said.
Locations in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th nationally in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections occur on the sexual, 6% on the bloodstream and 2% on the perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for one registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. court of appeals a ruling that does not recognize the reorganization of the Group’s debt achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario places a nefast precedent for any domestic company with branches in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, then, that the procedures in accordance with the survival of signatures that are allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, against international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backdrop to the judgment issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties on all over the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
In the beginning, while the case judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal says the main procedure is the merchandise tender handled in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created to this end, placing the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the vote intercompanies, recognised in the critical mass of the competition the debts that had with their matrix the subsidiaries of Vitro, would not have achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, in addition, is that in the absence of the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the Cortes of the United States, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
This is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 after the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, sticking the clutches to the country.
Soon, the signature of the González Sada family will interpose a recourse of reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of this, that is, the five magistrates, given that only three voted.
If it does not prosper, it will be claimed by the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The grave of the case is that the court laid down a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which it details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law on Commercial Competitions, stating that this was unleashed with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to match this with Chapter 15 of the Law on Bankruptcy of the United States.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has clung to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two sides: hit Vitro and hit the country.
The general balance
During several months of the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation unions against the company's ex-due, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aviators Pilots has already found the bottle neck.
The instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the F/589 trust of the Bank IXE, on behalf of Mexican Aviation, 198 million pesos.
The funds would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with an area of housing at the valley for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental wreckage that ravaged part of protected areas and raised the mother of all shadows against industry.
ACTA is dead
Submitted by the government a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the Senate itself having disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the boarding sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as extensive as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a brainwash confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a player of minor categories, a player of National Higher Basketball, mastered and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put a lot of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my life.”
Kings do not exaggerate in making this assertion.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, testify so.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all, the ones he treats with the greatest emotion are those that remind his passage by the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he completed 15 years serving as a co-powered or empowered franchise.
“These were my best years, the ones I most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether it was as an empowered, co-powered or leader.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at the BSN.
From then on, “Cuco” Ortiz was in charge, who was a great administrator,” Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" in height.
Do you want it?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best snipers.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another more.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse it, but already at a distance, since for 1988 it was already a federative championship.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executives and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it must have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this 1990 World Cup group the best national team you’ve ever seen?
It is among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we gave a fur to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one we won the bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that wasn’t the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the pan-American Mar del Plata mess, we won gold against all predictions.
Who is the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level like Piculín did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Boricua leader?
This is very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What has you left to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Nowadays children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and coursework for executives, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
Most of what I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a scrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predator oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon from complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, affectionate, and talented, and I’ll surprise him a lot.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him to her home.
He was also the protagonist of two short-time comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that brought Hagman to his highest star.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated international speculation and risky millions of dollars in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.’s cousin Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. caught her pregnant and then threatened to label her a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want on J.R’s blade,” Hagman said in 1988.
You should say, “Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.”
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone “enormous, inside and outside the screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the luck to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already completed the recording of five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was underway, the channel.
Immediately there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle Hagman’s loss.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatre stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in some way," he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer something of comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be a bit uncomfortable for a short time, but they’ll be fine.”
He was also an activist against the habit of smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course exploring the “End of the World”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible ankle: The end of the "long regressive count" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as a proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea of what was waiting for him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a tax haven that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If one looks at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only teacher offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the latest in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyzed why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students looked at films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare them to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only “The End of the World.”
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option of teaching the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It saturated in two hours," Restall said about his high-average student course, which filled up with 35 students.
We received email messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old career student of Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — much less a professor — said they believed in the December 21 expiration date.
“Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy and we somehow discredit it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise of these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about this,” he said.
Especially in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the “end of the world” there.
"The Philippines is not involved in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final judgment have been talked about, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin to immediately think about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they were thinking of going to “the end of the world” parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
