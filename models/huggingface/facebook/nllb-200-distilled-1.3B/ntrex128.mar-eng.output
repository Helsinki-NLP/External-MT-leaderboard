Welsh AM is concerned about looking like the Muppets.
Some AMs are skeptical about the suggestion of changing their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This suspicion has been raised by plans to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
There is concern among various political parties that the AM will not be a sign of change.
One AM worker said that his group was concerned that the title "sounds like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp means fool in Welsh and pwp means feces.
A Plaid AM said the entire group was "outraged" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted that the move from MWP to Muppets was a minor verbal abuse.
In this context the Welsh alphabet is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law to initiate the name change, said: "The final decision on any description of what the Assembly members should be called will of course be up to the members".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the findings of a public consultation on the proposals which showed broad support for naming the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AM title, the Commission favored the Welsh MP or WMP, however, the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
The AMs are of course suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft law on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The amendments will include other changes in the mode of functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualification of AMs and structure of the committee system.
When AM discusses the bill, it will have the final say on the question of what name to use.
Macedonians to vote in referendum on changing country name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is being held to resolve a decades-old dispute between the region of Macedonia and neighboring Greece.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a representation of its territory, and EU and NATO members have consistently resisted attempts to give it.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But, including Prime Minister Zoran Zhao, supporters of the referendum claim that the name change is only the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
While the church in Harlem was struggling, the bells of St. Martin's were silenced.
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said there was a bar and a discussion on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, none of this".
He said it was understandable that the bars had disappeared.
"People come together in different ways" nowadays, he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms next door where people go regularly".
In terms of negotiations, they worry that the money from the asset sales won't last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started".
He further said that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings, which would be condominiums filled with people who do not help the neighbouring shelters.
"The majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so it will be a very short time before this discussion closes completely because most people who come to live in these condominiums are not likely to be members of this discussion".
Both churches were built by white groups before the metropolitan community - Harlem - became a black metropolitan in 1870, a decade after St. Martin.
The original white Methodist group left in 1930.
A group of black people who were praying nearby took ownership of the building.
A group of blacks took over St. Martin's led by Rev. John Howard, who had led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, and opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, and they started Carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "Poor People's Bell".
In July, experts who played the carillon described it in different ways: "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carillon played by a black man, Dionysius A. Lind, who debuted in a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said that St. Martin's did not transfer him.
What's happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, brought in part by church leaders, and the rest by the Episcopal Diocese.
The vestry  The parish's board of directors, made up of general leaders  They expressed concern in writing to the diocese in July that the diocese would attempt to hand over "the matter of costs" to the vestry, however the vestry was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark on Lobster Drive in California.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while he was honking for lobster on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at around 7am in Encinitas, near Beacons Beach.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and he and a group of people went to him and helped him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was a joke that he caught the lobster, but then he realized "he was screaming, he bit me!
I've been bitten!'
He had a whole shoulder bone out", he realized after Hamel rescued the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'"
The boy was airlifted to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined not to be a threatened species.
Giles said the wounded boy had sustained severe upper-body injuries.
Authorities closed the beach access from Panto Beach in Casablanca to Swamyj in Asinitas for 48 hours for inspection and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not threatened.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with department store-style beauty oils through the appointment of expert assistants, boots, superdrug and debonhams.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.8bn cosmetics market, as the market continues to grow while fashion and homeware sales decline, larger beauty eels will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
As supermarkets look for ways to use the shelf space once used by TVs, microwaves and homeware, investment in cosmetics is coming.
Sainsbury's said it will double its cosmetics portfolio to 3,000, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Twitzerman and Dr. For the first time, PawPaw.
The current ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in branded parts found in stores like boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range to make most products vegan friendly, which is being increasingly demanded by young shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrances Shop will be offering discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London, while the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do a lot to attract people to them.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coop, said the outlets will increasingly look like department stores while supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl are trying to compete against discounters with more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury is setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also launched several habitats since acquiring both these chains two years ago, which they believe have been successful in increasing grocery sales and making the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to redesign its beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split the revenue from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the scheme by including a wide range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, says: "We have redesigned our beauty oils to be environmentally friendly for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to advise.
Our range of brands is tailored to each and every need and with an attractive environment and convenient locations, we are attractive beauty destinations that challenge the old shopping patterns".
Peter Jones 'screwed' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of £11m contract
TV presenter Holly Willoughby 'screwed' Peter Jones after he cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The business has been compared to the Paltrow Gup brand in Guyana.
The morning presenter, 37, said on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby stepped out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to woo Dragons' Dane star Peter Jones and is focused on her new grand deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "outraged" when the TV sensation admitted at a stressful meeting at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new deals - worth £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to focus on her homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The business is compared to Paltrow's Gup brand in Guyana and is estimated to double Bilobie's fortune to £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones got off the UK jet and headed to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was at the top of the list of Holi priorities till now.
This was going to be her long-term future, which would have made her successful for the next decade or two.
Her decision to leave was a shock to everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, so close to the opening.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse full of stuff that's ready to sell".
Experts say the departure of one of Britain's most promising stars, Dish Morning, will cost the firm millions of dollars, and its launch could be further delayed, due to massive investments in products ranging from cushions to candles and clothing to homeware.
And it can also be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been very close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for the past ten years.
He co-founded Truly in 2016 with Willoughby Cap and Jones, and 52-year-old Jones became chairman in March.
The couple vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on these business developments".
We had a lot of conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism of what some consider to be "the president's indecent" comments and being so positive about the North Korean president.
Why has President Trump given up so easily?
Trump said it in his fake "news anchor" style.
"I have not given up anything".
He noted that Kim is keen for a second meeting after Trump hailed the initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's disarmament.
But disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "subtle response" from the United States to its moves to disarm early.
Instead, he noted that the US is imposing sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are going very well", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
Our efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: rocket tests have stopped, help is being provided to resolve the Oasis, and the rest of the American personnel are returning home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space, it's better to have about 200 people here", Trump pointed a finger at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and earthquake devastate island, killing hundreds
After the Lompoc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that we are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work on site.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that Indonesian authorities are studying the situation in Palu to see if foreign entities can be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Indonesia is under-prepared to deal with the natural disaster due to the constant earthquakes.
Although tsunami nets have been built in Ashe, they are not readily found on other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued earlier, there is a possibility of loss of life due to the absence of a tsunami warning in Palu.
In good times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make relief work even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crisis site.
President Joko Widodo has been at the center of his election campaign, raising the issue of improving Indonesia's broken infrastructure, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the shortcomings in the financial supply are facing Mr. Joko's administration, which is challenging him to be re-elected next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressures of Indonesia's long-running ethnic tensions, in which Muslim majority members have chosen a more narrow path of faith.
Christian and Muslim gangs used axes, arrows and bows, and other village weapons, fighting in the streets, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing thousands.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has kept a clean sheet against Chelsea.
Daniel Stiridge scored a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea.
He received a pass from Sheridan Shakiri approximately 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as Sturgeon were down 1-0.
He tapped the ball on his left side and then picked up a shot towards the far post.
His attempt went over the top of the box and into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed the bowler, Kepa Arizabalaga, and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, get on the ball and when players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, I tried to make as much time for myself as possible", Sturgeon told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming and I touched him once and didn't think much about it and just shot him".
Chelsea led 1-0 until half-time after a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker then passed a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, then took a shot near the midfield and scored in Liverpool's half.
Kovacic immediately gave-and-go on the midfield.
Then he hit a nice punch, so Hazard went into the box.
Hazard broke through the defensive line and saw Liverpool's Alison Baker and finished his game with a left-footed shot into the far post.
Liverpool's Champions League group stage match will be played at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3 pm.
Chelsea will play in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm here in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
The 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday reported that several people were trapped in the rubble of buildings and that the quake had caused waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
In the city of Palu, with over 380,000 people, the buildings that have fallen are now piles of rubble.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder following the death of a woman.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the 44-year-old woman's head was found at 7.55am on Grayson Mews on John Street with blunt force trauma.
Police have asked people in the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'This investigation is in its early stages but I would urge anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has any momentary recordings on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a building.
Friends who claim to know the woman came to the scene this afternoon and were asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and we have informed the next of kin of the deceased woman.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews was trying to enter his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he became silent.
Residents were told that they would be allowed back into the building after several hours.
A police officer was heard telling someone that the entire area has now been designated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, she was crying.
She kept saying, 'This is terrible.'
At 2 pm, two police vans were inside the siege and another van was outside.
Several officers were standing inside the blockade, guarding the blocks of flats.
Anyone with information can contact DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or CrimeStoppers on 0800 555 111 by calling 30 September log 247.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is a recent monument to the rewrite of history controversy.
Removing him would be tantamount to rendering a poetic justice, as his puritanical followers of a flamboyant head have carried out Taliban-like destruction of many of Britain's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
Cromwell Society president, John Goldsmith, said: "It was only natural that the current debate over the removal of the statues would have a negative impact on the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
This glorification of the English Civil War was not ordered or brought about by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be blamed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's lavish depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and is part of a historical portrait of this figure that many still believe to be revered.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "According to many, perhaps more so than today, in the late nineteenth century Cromwell was a supporter of parliamentary, in his case of course, monarchical, over external pressure.
Whether this description is completely accurate has been a constant subject of historical debate.
One thing is certain, the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our country, and Cromwell is a personally identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His performance as Lord Protector is also celebrated and memorable".
A pig from the Mastwal killed a Chinese farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reported.
The man, whose surname is "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured aorta in a pool of blood at the Lyupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a hoggy in Shining, Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
It was reported that he had come with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said that the cage had a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound duck killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and confused", said another brother, whose last name was Wu, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent anyone from attacking him, and police were gathering evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer was run over by a 650-pound pig on his farm, and his wife finally kicked him out.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can "spoil" them.
"They're just playing games.
They're very smart, very inventive... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve", he said.
The effects of the storm Rosa will cause heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, as Rosa moves into colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico, its intensity is decreasing.
However, Rosa will provide additional rainfall in northern Mexico and southwestern US in the coming days.
At 5am Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa had winds of 85 mph, making it a Category 1 storm, and was located 385 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a swelling over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form and is moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa Baja moves toward the California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push deep temperate moisture northward across the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Later, the upcoming inflation will combine with moderate humidity to produce widespread heavy rainfall in the South West over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall is likely to cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possibly desert collapse.
Due to the deep temperate humidity, rainfall will be 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected.
The disruption of the temperate rainfall can lead to sudden floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is very dangerous to go out into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become muddy rivers and locally high winds and dust storms.
The coming storm will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coast.
More than half an inch of rainfall is possible, so a small amount of debris can flow and the roads will be slippery.
This may be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Some light rainfall will occur in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, followed by widespread rainfall late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder, there may be some sharp temperature fluctuations in October, but the temperate zone will remain very hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short periods of time.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in Central America.
There's a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will rise and expand again.
A warm start is expected in early October with a wide range of 80 degrees from the southern plateaus to the northeastern parts of much of the central and eastern United States.
New York City temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the normal average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a higher than average temperature for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.
The emotional testimony Thursday by Supreme Court appointee Brad Keveno and the woman who allegedly sexually assaulted him in the 1980s, Christine Blasie Ford, was watched by more than 20 million people, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, with political turmoil continuing, broadcasters interrupted regular programming at the last minute on Friday by sidelining an agreement brokered by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake of the FBI to handle the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Keveno caught him drunk at a high school party and trying to undress.
Keveno, in a very emotional testimony, said that we are 100 percent sure that nothing like this happened.
The witness was likely seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, Nelson said.
The company is counting the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The other networks that showed the show, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nelson usually has some trouble counting the number of people who look at offices.
In this respect, it is the same as the audience for a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
With presenters strongly supporting Keveno's appointment, Fox News Channel led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nelson said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nelson, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, the excitement reached its peak.
Flake remained the center of attention in the Friday show.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Keveno, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters chanted against him on Friday morning as he walked up the stairs to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood for several minutes with his eyes down, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", one woman said.
"Do you think they are telling the country the truth?
They were told, "You have power when all these women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator closed, said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was about to vote to send Keveno's nomination to a vote before the full Senate, cable and broadcast networks broadcast it all hours later.
But Flake said that we would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the appointee next week, which the minority Democrats are pushing for.
His conversations with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, partly convinced Flake.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck's choice had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kevenock without a review.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Keveno.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicising' Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "politicising" Britain's future and undermining the national interest over her plan to leave the EU.
Prime Minister Theresa May is here for the Hoover Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 20th September 2018.
In another of his newspaper cover interviews, his former foreign secretary Boris Johnson further attacked his so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's taxes was "absolutely unlikely".
Police arrested Dayton Simpson, suspect in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old basketball player, Wady Sims, at LSU.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The video of the fight between Sims and Simpson was released by the authorities, and the police said that Sims' glasses were missing in the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing the lunatic.
His bond was set at $350,000, his lawyers said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, The State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents with assisting in the investigation and arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva thanked regional law enforcement for their "serious and pursuit of justice".
Seams was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wady's death.
"This is what I'm constantly worried about", Wade said.
The ash from the volcano rained down on Mexico City.
Ash from the Pocketpetal volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after it began moving rapidly in the crater on Saturday, releasing 183 volts of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The Centre was responsible for monitoring many tremors and aftershocks.
Images showing windows of cars with ash-covered windows were on social media in nearby cities such as Shochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity in the vicinity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital. A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
A clash between police and Catalan separatists broke out on the eve of the anniversary of the independence referendum.
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona, and thousands of people joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on secession.
When riot police stopped a group of masked separatists, they threw eggs and paint balls, which caused a cloud of dust to collect on the streets crowded with airVRV tourists.
When the incident broke out later in the day, the police used batons to bring her under control.
For hours pro-independence groups chanted "never forget, never forgive", while pro-unificationists chanted "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people with minor injuries were treated in the encounter.
The region of independent thought has been in a state of extreme tension for a year since the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considered illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
Voters voted in large numbers to become independent, but the voter turnout remained low as those opposed to partition boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to disrupt polling stations during violent clashes across the region.
The pro-independence group had been camped out all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The protest continued but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termis, 68, an electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's chances of independence.
"We had a very good life last year.
I saw tears of joy in my parents' eyes when I voted, but we are stuck", he said.
Despite a small but significant victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their popular leaders either going into self-imposed exile or awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Pig, a 42-year-old mechanic, commented on the police support protest by phone, saying that politicians on both sides of the conflict supported it.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to protest the decline of democratic values and the ridicule of the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate in the European elections", he said.
London: Men arrested after car broke into home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested for repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in the Balinegrad Crescent.
The entrance and the building were also damaged, said department inspector Bob Blemings.
At one point, a crossbow was also likely thrown at the car.
The attack of the sheep gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was the winner.
Livingston, promoted to manager of Ibrox, surprised Rangers by handing Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack turned the tables and Gary Holt's team tied Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's side have been unbeaten in the Premiership this season and next Sunday, they will face Hearts, who are eight points behind.
Prior to that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, who will continue their unbeaten run of six games in the division, have not seen a defeat since their coach Holt took the reins from Kenny Mueller last month.
Livingston hooked up a chance against the Bottle visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored, because their perfect shot had put the Rangers in complete trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through the loophole but crawled in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow slid Craig Holcutt's header into the goal, only to expand his effort.
The hosts knew they could cause trouble for the visiting team, so they were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how it became a critical goal.
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston had a free kick, and Declan Garragher and Robinson paired up with Menga, who took possession of the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers had maintained their dominance, but the opposing defense was unbeatable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not much of a threat.
The same pattern would continue in the second half, however, Alfredo Morelos had to defend from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor's legs stumbled Scott Pittman and Lithgow sent the ball further away from Livingston.
Crosses kept coming in and out of Livingston's box, while two penalty claims were dropped, one for handball and one for the challenge to player Glenn Middleton.
The Bible says: "The earth is the work of your hands, and the productive land your hands.
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lemont at the Tony MacArthur Arena
A tremendous shot and result for Livingston.
As for the men, they played very well, they exceeded expectations in this direction.
His style of play and player has changed little since his return from the top spot, but Holt should be given the credit for the way he shaped the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcott played with heart, leading a well-rounded defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Voral in the crosshairs.
However, the Rangers' motivation was waning.
They fell short of their standard game, as much as they did under Gerard.
Their final game was a failure -- they only beat the home team once -- a warning to the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was given a mixed reception in Cologne.
The Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday.
The visit, which marks the final day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit, aims to improve relations between the NATO allies.
Their differences remained on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Later, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a grand new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to avoid a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters had gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of people demonstrating against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome their country.
The two-fold image of the guests, who were viewed as heroes by some German Turks and despised as dictators by others, was reflected in these two demonstrations.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed after colliding with car
A cyclist was killed after colliding with a car in London.
The accident, a busy Deptford street, happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics helped, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This is the second accident in months after a cyclist was killed in a collision on Childress Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working to identify the deceased and notify his immediate family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been rerouted and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officers were injured after a riot broke out in a high security men's prison, the prison office said.
Rioting started at 09:30 BST on Sunday in HMP Long Martin and is ongoing.
Specialist "tornado" officers have been called in to deal with the riot, which involves eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The officers suffered minor facial injuries and were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lantern.
Six employees were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and will have to spend more time in jail".
HMP Long Lantern houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison governor was reported to have been hospitalized after an inmate attacked him.
And last October, riot police were called in to deal with a serious riot in which workers were attacked with bridge balls.
Hurricane Rosa is causing flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (probable to affect tropical areas).
Tropical low pressure zones are rare to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen as Hurricane Rosa moves southwest into the desert with its remaining strength next week, creating a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as for Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
Ross is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain expected late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "Only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained their status or low pressure belt since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Center forecast is 2 to 4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches of rain in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the Desert Southwest including Central Rockies and Great Basin are expected to get 1 to 2 inches of rain, while 4 inches in some places.
For those who are not at risk of sudden floods, the rainfall from the showers will be beneficial as the region is suffering from drought.
While flooding is a concern, a little rain can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a low-intensity drought, the second highest category", reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will cross the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa's wind speed peaked at 85 miles per hour on Sunday, and it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is experiencing colder waters in the Pacific, which is reducing its strength.
Thus, it is expected to reach Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Three to six inches of rain are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move north of Mexico as a tropical storm as a tropical low pressure belt before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, then moving through Arizona and entering south into Utah late Tuesday.
"The main threat from Rosa or its residual effects is extreme torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is likely to cause life-threatening flooding and landslides in the hill areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrested on suspicion of murder
Three minors and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The minor was found in a wounded state in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where his condition was reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, an 18-year-old, two and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Redstock area overnight, Somerset Police said.
The officials have appealed to anyone who has mobile phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump told Keveno that the Democratic Party was "swept with selfishness, anger".
"A vote for Judge Keveno is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and provocative behavior", Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Keveno was surrounded by the "selfishness, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his candidacy process.
Keveno testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying allegations that he sexually abused Christine Blasey Ford when she was a minor.
Ford also confirmed his allegation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the day was "a day when the American people saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Keveno".
"The confirmation of Judge Keveno is the confirmation of one of the most successful legal experts of our time, a judge with a distinguished career in public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president inadvertently mentioned Keveno's candidacy, while speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
We are now five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but I'm really standing", he said.
"That's why I'm running against the big candidates everywhere".
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder".
A senior GOP leadership associate told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Keveno's candidacy is expected by Friday.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami kills hundreds, death toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed, with many more washed up, after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the shores of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the shore of the city of Palu when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the shore, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were doing their jobs on the shore and they didn't leave immediately and they died", Indonesian disaster agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it was dragged in, cars, boats, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled at 800 kph (497 mph) over the open sea before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Management Agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, a bridge bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Even after this, the coastal town was still hit by earthquakes on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Institution for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive", and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that some bodies have been recovered from the rubble of collapsed buildings, while 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that in an area called Donggala, 300 kilometers north of Palu near Naria, the death toll and damage could be higher, which was close to the epicentre.
Communication was "completely disrupted" and there was no sign of the dungala, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people lived here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"It is already a crisis, but it could be worse", it said.
Officials said that the flooding occurred within the period of the warning, but the agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the public that Palu was hit by the tsunami.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man can be heard standing on the top floor of a building giving a tsunami warning to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water slammed into the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages and disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but rescuers are in dire need of food and other basic amenities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief operations only and will remain closed till October.
President Joko Widodo will visit rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision staff have safely reached the city of Palu, where they have set up palm trees in their office premises, he said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
As relief groups begin to prepare for disaster response, some have complained that foreign aid workers with deep experience are being forced to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the disaster area if it has been declared a national disaster area.
That has not happened yet.
"The disaster is now a provincial-level one", said Alia Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Why, once the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' then we will open up to international assistance, but that's not the case yet".
As the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing still hope that miracles will happen to find their loved ones, as such stories are common in natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body.
Two paragliders who were trained by the Indonesian national paragliding team coach, Gendon Subandono, for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month are missing.
The other people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Shri Mandi said.
As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
He said that within hours of the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spreading in the paragliding community, he had sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu contestants participating in the Beach Festival.
However, their messages, instead of two blue dots, were left with only one faint dot.
"I think it means that the messages have not been received", he said.
While depositing money into an ATM in Newport, Levi, thieves stole $26,750.
A Newport Police Department spokesman said that robbers stole $26,750 from a brick employee while he was depositing money into an ATM in Newport on Friday morning.
Detective Dennis McCarthy told the newspaper that the driver was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to bring in more cash.
While he was busy, another man "ran after Brink's employee" and ran off with a bag of money for the delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, the paper said, but police did not say the exact number of people involved.
If anyone has any information regarding their identity, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changed his name to Y.
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Jay-Z.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It was formally called Kenny West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and had taken the moniker for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who left the show for "emotional reasons", according to the producer.
A shortened form of his current business name, West has previously stated that the word is religiously important to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm you, you.
This shift has gone from Kenny, which is the only one, to just Y, which is the net reflection of our best, our worst, our confusion, everything.
This album is more a reflection of who we are".
This is one of the popular rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names like Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced that he likes the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West coordinator Jay-Z has also made a similar change with or without a hyphen and Capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians, in the wake of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Latloko Plaza to "never use the military to intimidate the Mexican people".
Soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans studying through monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said that youth are turning to criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The United States should double its funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI businessman Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The US has no formal AI policy, but this reaction comes after various US government departments announced about AI.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year, which aims to become the No. 1 AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling AI research budgets would be a good start, because all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking forward to the next revolution in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of the next big breakthrough in AI in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent AI companies.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee referred to past US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be, to help identify the next future people.
Researchers in the US have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"China is not robbing academics, but corporations are", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent individuals from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy will also help the US strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think that PhDs in AI should be given green cards automatically.
China's State Council released its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
Li said that while China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the US fund researchers, the quality of academic work in China is poor.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint AI center to develop partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a selection committee on AI.
And this month DARPA announced it was investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
In the case of the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a US bill aimed at creating a national security commission on artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve their decades-old dispute with Greece, which has banned their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, which insists that its northern neighbor has a claim to its territory and has used its right to refuse the country's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign raised doubts that the voter turnout would be at least 50 percent, which is necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favour of accepting a deal with Greece and joining NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price to pay for Macedonia to pursue membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO, a country that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the same umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Giorgiveska, a 79-year-old citizen from Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have said that we will abide by the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The NEC said that as of 1 pm, there was no irregularity.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters had cast their votes.
I'm out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old voter Jose Tanevsky from the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on changing the country's name to Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, opening the door for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old housewife, is setting up a small platform and setting up chairs in front of tents set up for the anti-sovereignty protesters.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a firm hand, not through the back door", Kavardarkov said.
Our country is poor, but we have self-respect.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia coordination".
Prime Minister Zhao said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the majority will support because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zhao said after the vote.
He said that if the result is "Yes", it will be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required threshold.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of people plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For this referendum to be successful, it needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
If this referendum fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policies of the Western-led government that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City makes his way through the entire Brighton defence for the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday, giving Manchester City a 2-0 win.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute was very easy.
This Argentine striker and the starting lineup got a pass in midfield.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders before he was knocked out in the open.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed the ball around a defender and then he shocked a lot of people on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed a pass to his left, there was Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to re-attach the ball, using his right boot to hit Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan on the right side of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We used to say he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored in that moment".
But in the Stirling Premier League match, the Sky Blues took the lead early.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was then given a ball inside the Brighton area.
He passed the ball beautifully to Leroy Sen from the left side.
Sen took a few touches and then Sterling took the lead towards the far post.
This Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before it went out of bounds.
In Germany, City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League at the Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinheim at 12:55 pm.
Scherzer wants to play a game of thorns against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the series, there was little reason to start another strong start.
But the ever-competitive Sherzer is expected to challenge the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if there is still a benefit to playing a series for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still waiting to fight for their first division title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver will be crowded, we can at least go after the rubber and play another team at a higher level than I've ever faced at any point this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they may have a reported tendency to let Scherzer come on such occasions.
Scherzer, making his 34th start, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will be looking to his usual practice on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA this season and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump took the rally to West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections, the Speaker cited the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as an indicator.
What we have done will be tested in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the biggest, biggest -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I go everywhere for the big candidates.
Trump continued, "You look at this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see this is all happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see this selfishness, this cruelty.
They don't care who you hurt, who you trample on to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and block".
And you've seen it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and selfish and cruel and lying".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee's nomination of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which drew a roar from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you open the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one. It was really bad body language.
Labour is no longer a broad church.
He does not tolerate what his heart says.
When my party's activists at Momentum voted to convict me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour MPs who have been told we are not welcome just for speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she took a strong stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn on the conviction.
On national security, on the importance of a responsible economic policy towards Europe, these are the very issues on which Jeremy unfortunately disagreed with previous leaders.
"We want meetings to be inclusive and productive", Nottingham East Labour said at a meeting on Friday.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were the same.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not have this atmosphere, and the promise of "more kind, gentler", politics has been forgotten if, indeed, it has begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that opposition votes are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every vote is weighed against whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, because colleagues who had expressed similar political views before began to expect me to go around and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
When I speak out publicly, and it doesn't really matter what I say, I get a wave of stigma on social media about being voted out, about the politics of the Centre, about not being in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the reactions to me are political in nature.
I am amazed at the professional and determined nature of friends who do not hesitate to shower sexual or racist slurs on a daily basis.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of profanity.
Jeremy Corbyn last week suggested that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so liberal that the party will collapse with every motion of no confidence or change in the election rules.
I had received a lot of advice over the past two years, including a plea to keep my head down and not talk anymore, and then I would be fine.
But that is not what I came to politics to do.
Angered by the fact that my school's entire classroom was literally crushed by the Thatcher government's negligence, ever since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, as a local councillor or as a government minister, I have called for better public service provision for those who need it most.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any way confused about the state of my policies and the area of disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the motion on Friday, I would just like to say that the Brexit that the country is heading towards, which will adversely affect families, businesses and our social services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the truth is that I have a message not for the Nottingham movement, but for the people of my constituency, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no amount of threats of dismissal or political justification can deter me from my work, which I believe is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East.
IR 38  17 Melrose: Unbeaten IR reaches the top
The two late tries may have had a slightly adverse effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a win in this day-long match in the amazing-fun Tenants Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, his defense was as good as his ability to take chances, which gave the home team and coach Peter Murchi every reason to be happy.
"We have been tested so much for our game and we are still unbeaten, so I am happy", he said.
Robin Christian of Melrose said: "I owe it all to Irene, who has seized the opportunity better than we have".
A 14th-minute try by Grant Anderson, deflected by Frazier Klimo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card released by the Warriors for Scotland cap Rory Hughes gave Melrose points and Jason Baggott pulled off an unassailable try.
Climo gave the A's the lead with a penalty before halftime, then he returned a single try at halftime to give the A's a 17-5 lead.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Baggott reversed Patrick Anderson's try to close the gap by five points.
The game was then stopped for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the stretcher and from the restart Eyre was further advanced by a reversal of Climo to McDowell's try.
Ayr's season-captain, Blair McPherson, was later given a yellow card, and again, Melrose took advantage of an extra player with an unassailable Bruce Calvin try at the end of a highly stressed left.
The home side later returned, but, while tackling Klimos from the penalty line-out without a ball, Strawhan Hutchinson was given a yellow card and McPherson struck a touchdown back to beat the advancing Ayr.
After catching Kyle Rowe's box kick of David Armstrong and sending the flanker Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try, Climo converted him as he did at the re-start.
Steel Game Star is looking to try his hand at a career in the hotel industry.
After learning that Steel Game star Ford Kernan had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company, he took the step to turn to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-starred in with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series of the ongoing show will be their last, and Keiran is planning her life after her work at Craigslist.
According to the official record listing, he is a director of Adriftmorne Limited.
Although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kearnan would be joining Glasgow's booming restaurant business, the actor declined to comment on the matter.

In all of Bolivia, the memory of beaches lost in the bloody 19th century struggle with Chile over resources is still alive - as if the hope of once again sailing the Pacific Ocean were still there.
Those hopes are perhaps the highest of the decade, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and perseverance, and of course expects a positive outcome from the outcome", said Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Casadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on big screens across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will rule on Bolivia's claims. After decades of ups and downs in negotiations, Chile has accepted the obligation to negotiate an autonomous sea route for Bolivia.
Bolivia's local president Evo Morales, who faces a contentious re-election battle next year, whose fate also depends heavily on Monday's election, is a fascinating figure.
At the end of August, he promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean".
But some analysts say the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely to change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to hand over Chilean territory, and has contracted not to determine the outcome of any potential talks.
The final argument took place just six months after the ICJ was elected, suggesting that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And in moving forward for the Bolivian cause, the last four years have pushed this back.
"The issue of obtaining the sea route has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has destroyed Chile's remaining prestige, he suggested.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations, but after that it will be very difficult to have a dialogue.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, has rejected the opinion that the court's decision-making process is unusually dynamic.
He said that Monday will be a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit.
Even though Morales is still the most popular leader in Latin America, Calzodala denied this, saying that he was using the maritime affair as a political ploy.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Rim, he added.
This result is an opportunity to see what the previous thing is that needs to be overcome.
North Korea said it would not disarm unless it could rely on the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that if his country does not trust Washington, it will never disarm its nuclear weapons first.
Ri was addressing the UN General Assembly.
He called for the United Nations to honour the promises made during the meeting between the rivals in Singapore.
His opinion comes as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stands on the path to restarting deadlocked nuclear politics after more than three months of meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "visionary fallacy" that perpetuated sanctions and U.S. objections to such a declaration, which would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is aware of Pyongyang's adoption of the Declaration without first taking a significant step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there are serious doubts about Pyongyang's seriousness about releasing its science base, which it sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris Fashion Show, we introduced the latest range that is huge enough to reach a main street near you.
If you want to expand your collection of hats or want full sun protection, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brownie introduced a range of oversized, distinctive hats for their SS19 collections, which became the style that made the aisle at Paris Fashion Week shine.
This summer, these highly impractical hats made an Instagram presence and these designers sent their stunning creations to catwalks.
One of Valentino's most distinctive pieces was an over-the-top pink hat, which was adorned with a wide brim like a pizza, which adorned the models' heads nicely.
Other larger accessories included a jewel-encrusted cling, a magic hat, and a pineapple in it, but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also introduced a range of these extraordinary masks - and that too just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn on and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the elite fashion.
One was a design that looked like scuba diving gear, with a hood and goggles, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you can use this huge fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Those who observe these styles predicted that you would find a huge number of these hats on the main road near you.
The oversized hats were seen rising on the tall heels, with a two-foot-wide border, and these straw hats were seen on the heads of everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The communal symbol behind these highly impractical hats, which were named on social media, was sent to another large structure for a catwalk - a straw beach bag, like a young model in a swimsuit who may have picked up a young boy.
The black orange Raphia bag, trimmed by Rafia Zaler and with a white leather handle on top, was the best piece in the Jacquamaz La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told Fimmel: 'I was expecting big hats and beach bags to hit the mainstream next summer. The designer made such an impression that the demand for this oversized device will be hard to ignore.'
JE: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this has continued into 2018, which has included another set of unusual test results, which are solely credited to individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the schools are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strives to provide the highest quality of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and their place as a global citizen.
As an education sector that can design and implement a prescribed school curriculum, we are looking at modern languages as a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes straight to their head.
If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes straight to their heart.
It is very important to remember that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the recent test results this year, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates amongst the individual schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIES member schools showed that 72% of students achieved high A grades in Mandarin, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject of choice is now being understood in the curriculum of individual schools and elsewhere as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that a lack of language skills was responsible for 17 percent of the reasons given by employers to fill vacancies.
Language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare youngsters for their future careers.
These skills have become essential in a globalized world, with more potential job opportunities that require language.
Regardless of the career they choose, if they learn a second language, they can have a real benefit in the future because they have a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to interact directly with people from abroad will automatically put the multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language in a communicative manner, and only 15 percent of the population could speak French, a double-digit number.
This is why investing in language education for today's children is so important.
Learning more languages, especially in developing economies, will create better opportunities for children to get meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus on more sophisticated modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK as we look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there are plenty of languages to choose from in private schools, and a class of teachers who are specialists in their respective fields.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare students and equip them with the skills to succeed in the future, no matter what.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that language is very important for the future of a country and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
I'm not going to be a fairy.

LeBron is set to make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in Sunday's preseason opener in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play has yet to be decided.
"It will be greater than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play limited minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's time of rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began his campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This was the first of five scheduled rallies for Trump next week, with stops at their favourite locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Withholding a confirmation vote for his nomination to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans fear losing control of Congress when the vote is held in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live online on YouTube.
Trump may address this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a case made tense by sexual abuse allegations that have held up an expected Senate confirmation vote for an FBI investigation for a week.
But the main purpose of these rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum as they head into the November election.
Thus, the Trump campaign has said that the purpose of the five rallies this coming week is to "boost volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that as we move forward with this busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The tonight's rally scheduled for the WesBanco Arena in Wheeling could bring in a large crowd of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and receive coverage from the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News reported.
This will be the second visit to West Virginia on Saturday in a month, a state from which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help out West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is going to have to come to his aid in this election", said Simon Hader, a political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters reported.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is determined to keep it alive as they go into Sunday singles.
After three solo sessions, the Saturday afternoon quartet gave the Ryder Cup what it needed.
The hell-eating emotional swing is a concept that was invented entirely in sports, but it's something that players have to believe in completely, and it's never more than that kind of competition.
So they're going to say, where's that emotion now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have a four, so I think we're gaining a little bit of momentum now", Jordan Speith said as he left at the end of the day.
Europe is in a favourable position, of course four points ahead and 12 more to go.
The Americans feel, says Speith, that even though they have little wind in their way, and they have a lot to encourage, it's not just because of the form of Speith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Speith has been aggressive from T to Green and his leadership is exemplary.
The celebration was high as his round began, as he and Thomas were two behind two, taking the important putt and editing all four squares.
The screams that were responsible for his putting to win the game when he was 15, which would have made you know that he believed that Americans were still in the race.
You really have to work hard and worry about your own game", said Speith.
It's about what each of these players left behind.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, with controversial Ryder Cup stories.
The European couple, unlike the others, but attractive, got four out of four, and there was nothing wrong with that.
Mollywood was the only couple who couldn't shoot a box on a Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided boxing on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and backed out at 9am on Friday.
That run, and the enthusiasm that poured in from the back of this roaring crowd, made it seem like they were the losers on Sunday, and as the sun began to set on Le Golf National, there would have been no more popular players to sustain a potential European win than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It would be more appropriate to have both of them on different holes at the same time.
Yet, the story of European prestige was premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson cut Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's Forbowl, when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
The Spaniards and Swedes, who had a bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes, never got close to a hole.
On Sunday, though, there was no one to help you out of your hole.
The reason why the foreballs and forums were so attractive to watch up close was because of the harmony between the couples, the advice they gave and the advice they didn't give and the way they had a strategy that could change in an instant.
Europe as a team played well, so they took a significant lead on the final day, but even in this Forums session, Team USA showed a fighting attitude for it, especially Stateside, where there was doubt.
Europe led 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a strong advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead over the United States after being eliminated from Saturday's Four Bowls and Four Sums matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods and led their points table to four points over Le Golf National.
Having lost at Hazeltine two years earlier, Thomas Jorn's European team dominated the US team who had played poorly in the morning fours in an attempt to retain the trophy, winning the series 3-1.
In the Forums, Europe fought harder and won the matches, but they could not compensate.
Jim Ferkey's team needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood", were the only pair to win all points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history after a rousing weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, he defeated the desperate Woods and Bryson Dashbuoy of the United States with even more vigor in the fight by scores of 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, would show occasional peaks of excellence, but of his 29 games in the foursomes and foursomes, he had now lost 19 and seven in a row.
After resting in the morning fours, Justin Rose returned to the foursomes with partner Henrik Stenson, defeating world ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, 1 and 2, respectively.
On a fragrant and windy day in southwest Paris, nothing happened to make Europe fit for its times.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won the four-balls against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter 2 and 1 and then came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 after missing the opening two holes in the foursomes.
Although only one draw is needed to keep the title for the previous champion Furyc, there have only been two times in Ryder Cup history that a team has come back from a four-point deficit going into the singles.
After being second-best for two days, however, Sunday's counterattack felt like it was outside their well.
North Korea has refused to unilaterally disarm without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were undermining confidence in the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Hoen told the annual general meeting of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "remarkable goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear test sites and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not seen any relevant response from the US, he said.
We will not have confidence in our national security without any confidence in the US and in such a situation we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally by any means.
While Rini reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to denuclearization steps, under which North Korea was to be rewarded for taking softer steps, his statement is noteworthy at a time when Pyongyang had not previously refused to stop unilateral denuclearization.
Rini referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever meeting between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim pledged to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to protect North Korea.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for lifting tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is insisting on denuclearisation first and forcibly increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective and is also objecting to declaring an end to the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is a notion for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the constant restrictions are destroying our trust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which US leaders had mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, saying: "Had South Korea been a party to the issue of denuclearization and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been such a deadlock".
Still, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he addressed the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the core of the US with North Korean missiles, when the "evil president" Trump called Kim a "rocket man on a suicide mission".
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who had threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courageous steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea stopped denuclearizing.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "Even if it took two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued at the UN that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the Security Council.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and decisively until the nuclear deterrence is fully, definitively and verifiably established".
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to block the supply of funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and explosive missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside and told the UN General Assembly that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, just for North Korea, and within hours, he was making gang-like demands to announce it.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy the missile site and, if the United States took appropriate measures, the nuclear complex.
He said Kim told him that he wanted "related measures" including the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest.
To counter the increasingly masculine culture of caffeine-serving, overnight stays, Harvard University is introducing a new sleep-over curriculum for all its undergraduates this year.
One academic found that when attending one of the world's top universities, they often seemed to be ignorant of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course, believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on education.
And at the end of the year, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did you tell me this story when I was in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students how good sleep habits are essential for students and athletes to improve their performance and overall health.
Paul Brierera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to launch the course after a week of students being found to be severely sleep deprived.
This one-hour course has a series of interactive goals.
One area has a picture of a dorm room, where students are having coffee, and there are curtains, trainers, and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athlete performance and the importance of sleep regulation.
In the second part, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their routines.
We know that this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Chizler added.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that the emphasis on modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality, adequate sleep should be a secret weapon for students to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said. Also to prevent weight gain, as depriving the brain of sleep keeps it hungry and makes them constantly hungry.
19-year-old Raymond Sone, who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler design the curriculum, which he took in his class during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course across the campus.
He hopes that in the next phase, all these postgraduate students will be told that they should complete such a course before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommended that students set an alarm to tell them when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your body clock, causing sleep problems.
Livingstone 1  0 Rangers: Menga's goal showed the sky to Gerard's team
The Rangers took another blow when Dolly Mango's strike defeated Steven Gerrard's disrupted team 1-0 at Livingstone.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first win on their way to victory after a 4-1 February win at St Johnstone, but Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager was only a result of Gary Holt's team, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team, lacking in motivation, never saw an attempt to tie.
With Rangers now pushed into sixth place, Livingstone have moved into third place, trailing only Hibernian on goal difference.
And it could be even more of a problem for the rangers because an object was thrown from the other end, and the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury.
Gerrard made eight changes to his squad, which surpassed the changes made by Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same Liv 11 who had scored a point from Hearts last week and was very happy with the way he was stalling their opponents with his fine moves at every turn.
Although the Rangers held more possession of the ball, Livingston made more use of the ball they had.
He could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman into Anne McGregor's goal, but the midfielder snatched his big chance.
Keegan Jacobs, who was on the deep, sent free-kick captain Craig Holcutt but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, came in at the back post.
The Rangers gained control but showed a lack of confidence in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos was adamant that he and Steven Lawless should have received a penalty at the quarter-final mark due to their collision, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed just two first-half shots on goal but did little to stop the tireless strikes of former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, Lasana Colibri's header and Ovi Izaria.
Livy's first goal in the 34th minute was against the flow of the game, but it was hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to counter Jacobs' set-piece on Deep.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose the sheep for easy completion.
Gerrard showed efficiency by calling in Colibri in place of Ryan Kent at the break, and the change had an immediate effect. Morlos on the winger passed but the formidable Kelly came through his line to block.
But, with Lithgow and Holcutt hitting a long ball in succession, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play their favourite way.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood firm to block Jacobs until Lithgow came from the far corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton claimed a late second for a penalty on the spot to Jacobs, but Thompson did not take it up again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, and beyond... on this day in Germany, the future physicist Jonas William "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radiation, a discovery that led to the invention of the Geiger counter.
Since then, in mainstream science, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of mainstream pop culture, as exemplified by the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", which featured Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as seemingly cowboy-like scientists:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive salts like uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the sound of the atoms' radiation coming out of the salt".
"They're popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that gave his name was immortal.
A new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' and kill malignant cells
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
In this method, immune cells are taken from patients and replaced in the laboratory.
They can then see proteins that are common in many cancers and then be re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various cancers.
After a woman was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize malignant cells, her ovarian cancer was found to be gone for more than 18 months.
In this method, immune cells from patients are taken and replaced in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein called HER2, which is common in many cancers, and then re-injected into the body.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", said Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "is associated with the development of many cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explains Professor Berzowski.
Similarly, an approach to extract immune cells from patients and "train" them to attack cancer cells is useful in one type of leukemia.
Kenny West, wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL, was a harsh critic of the Trump-led side.
They didn't like it.
After a rousing performance by Kenny West in which he praised US President Donald Trump and urged him to run in 2020, his crowd blew up the studio during Saturday Night Live.
The night of his "Ghost Town" performance, in which he wore the Make America Great cap, after singing the third song, he started to lash out at the Democrats and once again expressed support for Trump.
"How many times have I talked to a white person and they said, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
So, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star tingled Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's chatter was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not yet clear if the post was an attempt to mock West.
Also, West complained to the audience that his hat on his head caused him to suffer backstage.
"They teased me from behind the stage.
He said, 'Don't go on stage with that hat.'
They bullied me!
And then he said, 'I'm all over the place,'" he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Have you seen the sinking place?" So he said, "I'll wear my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you think the world should go on?"
Try to make love".
His comments were echoed by viewers at least twice, and SNL cast members seemed to be stunned, many said, one of whom told the publication: "A deathly silence spread throughout the studio".
West was brought in to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It in the guise of a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For the most courageous: Thank you for standing up for the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "as is and it's absolutely amazing".
"But I will not reward anyone who practices or spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art").
He is free.
We are also free", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "officially known as Kenny West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, but he followed Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Daddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly known as Snoop Lion, and of course, the former music emperor Prince, who changed his name to Mark, and the artist was formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant for drunk driving
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is attacking toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticized the masculinity of the hero, saying that such roles on screen often make young children feel that they must be bullied to gain respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something is wrong' and raised the question of how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Kit admits that he has a "very strong" desire to solve the problem.
'I personally feel very strongly at this moment - what went wrong with our masculinity?' he said.
'What are we teaching people as they grow up about the problems we are seeing now?'
Kit believes that the overly masculine characters on television are partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He adds: 'What is innate and what is taught?
Do they believe that the things they see on TV and on the streets make young boys want to have that same quality of being men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
Because something is definitely wrong with the young ones.'
In an interview, he admitted that he would not be doing a prequel or sequel after Game of Thrones ended next summer, and that he was "bored of the battlefield and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will work on a revival of Sam Shepherd's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best ending to Game of Thrones was a gift from his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on the show and in that sense, she gave me my future family and my life ahead,' he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played the role of Griet, the girlfriend of Kit's character John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New cases in China increased by 14%
China announced a 14% increase in its population with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials said that more than 8,20,000 people in the country are infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in parts of China by donating contaminated blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped sharply to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has increased everywhere.
The study findings suggest that due to the country's conservative values, an estimated 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Inadequate protection in such relationships is the cause of most infections.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal availability of HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee had hacked the GOP senator's data, calling it a "dangerous hoax" and a "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that one of her staffers posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were fueled by "conservative-right" pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on his Twitter account.
The information released reportedly included the residential addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
Information posted online on Thursday by an unnamed Islamic on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after those three senators investigated Kwan's case.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedStat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with Waters' office and displayed by an employee of Waters, The Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and basically false", Waters added.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - is not responsible for breaking this information in any way.
These baseless accusations are completely false and utterly false".
Waters' statement prompted immediate online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"It's frustrating to deny it", writes Fleisher.
"It shows that her nature is not worthy of being a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
They should not be distracted.
They do not want to question the motives of the accuser.
They need to be calm and happy".
Fleischer Waters' reaction was seen as a comparison to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kwan, who critics accused of being extremely angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a big deal if it is", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims".
"We will ensure that the culprits are exposed", she added, "and they will be held legally accountable for any acts that endanger their destructive nature and any or all members of my staff".
John English Strikes Again Review - The underrated spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition for any new film to feature British art depicting the effects of Brexit, and this also applies to the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise - which began in 2003 as Johnny English and was revived in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Will there be a cheerful self-mockery about how worthless we are as the country's new export opportunities?
In any case, the inefficient Johnny English with the rubber face has his license to cook things renewed for the second time - his name implies that he has a huge comic creation design for non-English film audiences.
He's definitely a dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre exaggerations of a little bit of glamour, looks a little bit like Mr. Bean, and his gang contributes a note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune for the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is based on the once-forgotten Barclays TV commercials by Atkinson, a traveller and mysterious international who adds to his confusion.
There are also a couple of great moments in this latest JE movie.
I loved the scene where John English is wearing a medieval armor and he's going to the helicopter and the fan blades are banging on his head.
Atkins' gift for physical humor appears to be far less effective, and strangely unnecessary, especially given that "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now faithfully incorporate humor as a factor.
The humor seems to be intended for children, not adults, and I didn't find Johnny English's Freak Accident as inventive and focused as the humor in Atkinson's silent film as Bean.
Now the general premise of the issue is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker breaks into a super-secret web network of British spies and reveals the identities of all the agents working in Britain, surprising the agents at work - a very small role for Kevin Alden.
The last hope for a violent and quarrelsome prime minister whose political popularity is already in decline: Emma Thompson plays a Theresa May-like character very well, but she has little room in the story to do more.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as every active spy is exposed, she will have to bring in someone who is retired.
And that means that the idiot Johnny English, currently working as a schoolteacher in a luxury housing estate, is giving extracurricular lessons on how to become a spy operative: here are some really funny moments, because, in fact, English school turns into a rock-type spy academy.
English is suddenly called back to the White House for an emergency briefing and is again met by his longtime colleague, Bo, played by Bell Miller.
Bo is now married, he's married to a submarine commander, a jolie-hockey-sticks role that's wasted the talent of artists like Vicky Pepperdine.
Batman and Robin, who make terrible mistakes, come to Her Majesty's secret service, where they are confronted by Olga Kurylenko's beautiful, deadly woman, Ofelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister comes under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech millionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the dreaded Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bo embark on their journey of ridiculous humor: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glitzy French restaurant; make a mess smuggling themselves off Volta's luxury yacht; and English messes up by trying to put on a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
The last episode has all the plot twists and turns, but as much fun and riotous as it is, it feels like a children's TV show.
It's a lot of stuff.
And like many other Johnny English films, I wondered: Couldn't British filmmakers give Rowan Atkinson a role that was worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party rejected plans to make Britain work four days a week and get paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party says the British are considering a radical plan to work four days a week and get paid five days a week.
The party reportedly wants company owners to repay the money saved by the AI revolution by giving employees an extra day off.
This will give employees a three-day weekend but will not reduce their salary.
According to the sources, the idea 'fits neatly' into the party's economic agenda and policies of shifting the nation towards the interests of the employees.
The trade union congress rewarded workers for making the four-day week a way to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'The policy changes are expected to be announced later this year.
'This will not happen overnight but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that is in line with the Party's vision of restructuring the economy in the interests of workers and the Party's overall industrial policy.'
The Labour Party was not the first party to sponsor such an idea, the Green Party had promised a four-day workweek in their campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this aspiration is not fully rewarded by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not party policy and is not what the party intended.'
Per Finance Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Council to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy in more detail.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from the 'faceless directors' of utilities and the 'sneakers' of utility companies.
The scheme of the Finance Minister also means that the existing investors in water bodies cannot get their full share of their investment back as the labour government can 'defraud' on the basis of the misconduct seen there.
He also endorsed the plans to recruit workers to the company's boards of directors and create a comprehensive ownership fund to fund 10 per cent of the equity of private sector entities to employees eligible for annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kwanou has changed their opinion.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the bureau's findings raise questions about whether any Republican members can be resilient to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI had found anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"I have gone to the hearing and spoken to Justice Kavanaugh.
All this happened, the accusation came out, and then I called them and I said, 'Why did you do this?'
He was firm, firm and unambiguous".
Graham's opinion, however, seemed to be settled.
"My verdict on Brett Kwan is final and a big charge can change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has vehemently denied the allegation", Graham Christine continued, referring to Blasey Ford.
"And not every person she named could have been able to make sense of it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't think anything new will change".
What is the Global Citizens Festival and have they done anything to eradicate poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that will feature some of the biggest stars in the world, is being held in New York this Saturday and its goal is equally as ambitious: Global poverty eradication.
In this seventh year of the Global Citizens Festival, thousands of millions of people will be seen gathering on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the art of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to spread the true purpose of the event, which is to end the world's wretched poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to help eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people working to end poverty.
To get free admission to the event (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), the audience had to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering to spread their global elimination goal, emailing a world leader, telephoning, or any other meaningful means.
But how successful are global citizens with 12 years to go to achieve their goals?
Is the idea of free music events for the public an honest way to get people to take action, or just another form of so-called "selectivism" - where people think signing an online petition or tweeting really makes a difference?
Global Citizen says it has more than 19 million "actions" recorded by its supporters for various causes since 2011.
He says his actions have helped to persuade world leaders to announce promises and policies worth $3.7 trillion or more, which will impact more than 225 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has made 390 pledges and declarations resulting from its activities, of which at least $1 billion has already been distributed or raised.
The Group estimates that the funds made available have so far directly impacted the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the promises include Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and organizers that "helps young children thrive to their full potential" and who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda.
With the help of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition as a footnote in history as insignificant as it is", Power of Nutrition Goodwill Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a music event in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking over 5000 actions to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the Government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 50 lakh women and children with nutrition assistance.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website is "What makes you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like our previous civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have grown stronger by coming together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Moné are among the artists who will perform at this year's New York festival, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could use "blockade" to block Russian energy exports - interim secretary
US International Secretary Ryan Zinke has made clear that Washington will use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching other markets, including the Middle East, the Washington Examiner said.
Zinke has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where Russia is acting at the invitation of its legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"The reason they are in the Middle East is because I think they want to broker energy like Eastern Europe, like the southern part of Europe", Zink is reported to have said.
And according to officials, these are the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States Navy has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes remain open to ensure that their energy does not reach the market, as well as to blockade if necessary", he said.
Zinc was speaking at an event organized by the nonprofit group Zinc Consumer Energy Alliance, which describes itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's positions on Russia and Iran's dealings and noted that they were effectively similar.
"The only cost-effective option is to take advantage of fuels and use alternative fuels, which is less than Russia", he said, calling Russia a "one trick pony" and saying that Russia's economy is dependent on biofuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration seeks to replace Russia as a cheaper alternative to European customers by increasing its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe.
Accordingly, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has "occupied" Berlin by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the USD 1.100 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 11,000 cubic meters, is a fully cost-effective project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we have a common view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The US objective has been strongly criticized by Germany, which has expressed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the leading organization for industry in Germany, has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement in Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem for me when our energy supply is interfered with by a third country", Dieter Kempe, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Representatives from Massachusetts said Elizabeth Warren would "watch very carefully" the 2020 presidential election.
Representative Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would "look carefully" at the upcoming presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren reiterated that she would consider running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the act of a woman being put in the highest office", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will be watching the presidential election very carefully".
Warren argued with Trump during the town hall, saying President Donald Trump was "leading this county in the wrong direction".
She said, "I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy".
Warren has been vocal in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday found that a majority of people in Warren's own constituency do not think he should run for president in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, eighty-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said Warren should not run.
Thirty-two percent of the people expressed support for such an election.
The poll, which tracks voter trends, showed that former Governor Deval Patrick had a higher approval rating of 38 percent for the likely election and 48 percent against.
Other key Democratic names discussed in the context of the likely 2020 election included Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to Associated Press, Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin gave an example of PTSD by Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"Seeing what my son is going through, what he's going through and coming back from, I think other families dealing with the devastating effects of PTSD and our soldiers coming back from their wounds can understand a little bit of their wounds", he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the detention an "elephant in the room", and she said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back thinking if their fellow soldiers and airmen and every member of the military has the respect for the country that they have here".
According to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman by interfering with reports of domestic violence and drunk gun possession.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposed the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class action lawsuit in August against federal policy, which was not disclosed.
She said she was abused by her partner "and his violent gang member's children" but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was locked up in Texas.
Lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries facing the problem of gang and domestic violence, with large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, Attorney General of the District of Columbia Carl Racine said the new policy "ignores decades of state, union and international law".
"All claims for relief under federal law must be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates that rule", the Friend-of-the-Court brief stated.
In the brief, the lawyers further argued that immigrants are more likely to become professionals and "provide essential labor", and that denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer allow victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence into shelters.
"It provides a safe haven for people who leave their homeland due to fear or persecution due to their creed, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political ideology", Sessions said in a statement on the policy on June 11.
All the problems that people around the world face every day -- even all the serious problems -- were never supposed to be solved in a shelter.
As the number of deaths doubles in the rush to find survivors, desperate efforts are made to rescue victims.
The situation for the survivors was becoming more and more dire.
"I feel very stressed", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, cuddling her feverish son in a detention center in the burned-out city of Palu.
"An ambulance brings a body every minute.
Clean water is a misery".
Residents were seen collecting their waterlogged belongings, trying to salvage whatever they could find, and heading back to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the injured, including a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent severe seizures.
He remembered the powerful earthquake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save myself.
I feel like I was trapped under a pile of mud on the wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had gone to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'disseminating' with 'advertising'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China denounced the use of the American press to spread propaganda against Beijing.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited a paid supply of Chinese newspaper in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most widely consumed newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, which China denied.
Trump's accusation that China is trying to influence the US election is a new chapter in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China, as US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington is likely to result in them imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and US experts say the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China at the start of the trade war were designed to influence exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party.
Longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an op-ed in the Sunday Des Moines Register, Branstad writes, "China is now duplicating its own free press with propaganda".
"The Chinese government is leveraging America's cherished tradition of free speech and free journalism by promoting its own campaigns with paid advertising in Des Moines", writes Branstad.
"In contrast, newspapers for sale on the streets of Beijing lack the anti-tune and do not truly reflect the differing views of the Chinese people on China's troubled economic outlook, as the media are tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that "a major Chinese newspaper has turned down an offer to publish his article", though he did not name the paper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are polarizing women voters by defeating Kavanaugh before the midterm.
As many top Republicans have come out in support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of various sexual harassment allegations, analysts have warned that he will be hit particularly hard by women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment is very strong and most Republicans are officially showing that they will vote for it.
Those things cannot be undone", said Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell College, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Rieher said he was skeptical that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) 's proposal for an FBI investigation at the time would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MovOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate hallway chanted "November is coming!" as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee supported Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mick reported.
"The enthusiasm and inspiration of the Democrats is flowing", said neutral political analyst Stu Rodenberg to the news site.
"People say it's already at the top level; it's true.
But it can go even higher, especially for unstable women voters in the suburbs, as well as young voters between 18 and 29 who don't like the president, and they don't usually vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that Republicans could be hit if they agreed with the confirmation.
"This is kind of a mess for the GOP now", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele was quoted as saying earlier last week by NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it's also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they treated her", Gay Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
However, in the wake of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, there is a dichotomy among Americans about who to believe, with Cavanaugh's bias slightly more pronounced.
In a new poll conducted by Yuvraj, 41 percent of respondents definitely or potentially believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or potentially believed Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said that if Cavanaugh definitely or potentially lied during testimony, only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Following Flake's request, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was attacked by Kavanaugh while drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez alleged that a Supreme Court nominee exposed his gender to him at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The father of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the well-known technologist, Inerpt, is a company built on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information to allow access to which people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee claimed that Inert's ultimate goal is "world domination".
"We have to do this now", he said about the start-up.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
They can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in one browser and all available at the same time.
The special thing about online personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information to handle.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inert is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to the company to make solid access for everyone.
The company currently comprises a security platform acquired from Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a staff of some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inert website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are "not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change that will completely degrade all their business models overnight".
"We don't ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inerpt's "mission is to provide commercial power and ecosystems to help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids".
In 1994, Berners-Lee had transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inertip, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added in the booklet.
Bernard Vaughan: World War I. The Victoria Cross is awarded to clerics.
His native celebration was held 100 years later in honour of the only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior in the First World War.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Vaughan had won the award in the attack on Belenglis and Lehighcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was shot dead by a hostage soldier in hiding, never knowing that he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday, his two grandsons unveiled a memorial plaque to his memory.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vaughn, said that the unveiling of the fountain 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat was "extremely symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vaughan led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog and heavy shelling from the battlefield and machine gun fire".
He then moved to the firing line and led the line "extremely bravely" before defeating three detachments alone, facing the cannons on the battlefield.
Lieutenant Colonel Von was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - about a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do but it was awe-inspiring".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughn also offered flowers after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the support of the crowd was a show of true heroic courage".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Beetlejuice 206, but instead they had to watch Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch a packed-up Beetle 206 but you're denied the main event.
The San Jose Bears had 13 bouts, including six bouts on the main card, and were scheduled to be shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, Gerard Moosey and Rory McDonald shocked UK viewers by broadcasting Peppa Pig instead of showing his coverage as they prepared to face each other.
Especially some people who stayed up until the early hours of the morning for that fight were disappointed.
A fan wrote on Twitter about the children's cartoon being "a kind of cruel joke".
"They had to put on a children's show because the content was not airworthy at 6am as per government regulations", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Belatar.
"Peppa the Pig", yes.
Scott Coker, president of the Beelzebub Company, said that in the future they would rethink their schedule to accommodate UK viewers.
"I think when I thought about replay, I thought it was a possibility that we could do this", Coker said.
"But it was six o'clock on a Sunday morning, and we couldn't do it until our Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
And trust me, there were a lot of messages coming and going after that change, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government case.
I can promise that it will not happen again.
We're going to have five fights instead of the usual six -- and we tried to give the fans more, but we failed.
It was an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'nothing' from his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says his sexuality made him feel inferior to everyone else - but it inspired him to succeed.
24-year-old-Daily said, "I didn't realize that everyone was like me until I was in high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent has reduced his appreciation for winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast at Laverne's first event, Daley said he grew up feeling "less than" everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority and being different has been the key thing that has given me strength and strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to show them that I was "something" so that when people actually found out about their sexuality, they wouldn't be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a high-profile LGBT publicist and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky enough to live freely without fear of the consequences of his actions and wanted others to show him "hope".
The three-time world champion said the man's falling in love - with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "was a surprise to her".
Daly married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he said age difference was never an issue.
"When you have been through so much at such a young age" - he first competed in the Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer just three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of his age who had seen so much up and down.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and Daley said their "entire approach" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said, 'I want to win gold,'" he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal".
Their son was named Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daily said his father had not accepted that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked if he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I didn't have the courage to tell them, 'You can't sit in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand when he took his last breath and I wasn't sure he wasn't invincible until he really stopped breathing and died", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that there could be no higher feeling than what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in the Olympic Games in front of home spectators", he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which matches him in preparation for the Olympics and still stands as a forked arm.

Michaelson, who was out of form, was picked up as an extra for the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Michelson will set a new record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape before this milestone becomes painful.
Michaelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th consecutive time, is being played by Captain Jim Furyk as an extra for Saturday's Foursomes and Foursomes.
Instead of participating in actual sports, as he always does for the United States, this five-time major champion divided his day into focusing on sports in the range in the hope of promoting and eliminating factors that were playing into his game.
Despite his career boom and never having been the most straight-forward driver, the 48-year-old Michelson is not ideal for the disciplined Lee Golf National Course, where long, steep sections never forgive a wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't as challenging, Michelson will face the exact same British Open winner, Francesco Molinari, in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans start 12 singles games with four points behind, in the absence of a good start, Michelson's match could be very important.
Furyk had faith in his player, except that he couldn't say anything more.
"He fully understands his role today, he patted me on the back and put his arm around my neck and said he will be ready tomorrow", Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given these teams a lot before and this week.
I probably didn't even imagine that he would play two games.
I had envisioned more, but that's what we decided to do, and that's the way I think we should go.
He wants to be there like everyone else".
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This may be the end of his Ryder Cup career which will never match his personal best.
Michelson won 18 games, lost 20 and drew seven, Furyk said his presence gave the team an intangible value.
"He is funny, he is sarcastic, he is sarcastic and he likes to make people laugh and he is a great person to be with the team", he explained.
"The young players will enjoy him, as well as this week, which is something to look forward to.
It's not just the game, it's more than that".
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bourne, knows that the big front could soon disappear.
European captain, Thomas Bourne, knows from experience that a good lead before the singles match in the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily be reversed in an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, when the team led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans but when the games ended they were exhausted and won by the lowest margin of only 141⁄2-131⁄2.[1]
"You keep yourself updated by reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won at Valderrama, but only by a small margin", Bourne said, looking at the class of 5-3 wins both Friday and yesterday in 2018 that gave Lee Golf National a 10-6 lead.
History will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You'll have to demolish it completely tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the perfect things.
It doesn't end until you get the marks on the board.
Our goal is to win the trophy and that is what we will focus on.
I've told you all the details, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know who's on our other side - the greatest players in the world".
Pleased with his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bourne adds: "I can never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's challenge is different.
Tomorrow, a solo exhibition will come up, and doing that is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you go out there alone, your skills as a golfer are tested.
This is the message you have to give to the players to perform at their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he wants to do his best".
Unlike Bourne, the opposing group Furyck would emphasize that his players perform better individually than they did as a pair, with the exception of Rordon Speith and Justin Thomas who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself turned the match around with Europe's "miracle of the day", before that defeat, as part of the winning team on both sides of that big end-of-day turnaround.
When asked by Captain Crenshaw in 1999 how his players had fared on their final day, he replied, "I remember every word of it".
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you have to start fast, like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When that speed goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We'll set up our lineup accordingly and put our players in this stage where we think we're going to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas was sent forward on performance to try to fight back and he faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, who were in the top half of the other Europeans.
"I put these players in this order because I thought they would cover all sides", Bourne said of his singles selections.
The German new battleship was postponed once again.
The German Navy's latest warship, the Glock, was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but due to poor systems and high costs, it will not enter service until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesperson quoted by Die Zeit, the commissioning of the flagship of the Baden-Württemberg-class battleship, Ryland-Phaege, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to be commissioned in 2014 but the future of this ambitious project was put on hold due to worrying post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class battleships.
It is understood to have a powerful artillery, anti-aircraft squadron and anti-ship missile, as well as some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include long maintenance life - the latest warships should be able to deploy away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays mean the modern warship - which allows Germany to demonstrate its power at sea - will already be obsolete when it enters service, Die Zeit reported.
The ill-fated F125 Battle Galab came into the limelight last year, when German naval officials refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Lom & Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy had returned the ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little information was given about the reasons for the return, but German media reported that there were several significant "software and hardware flaws" and that the warship was unfit to deploy on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ship would be manned by 120 sailors - half the manpower on the old Bremen-class battleships.
It was also found that the vessel is too heavy which will reduce its performance and the Navy will not be able to upgrade it in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rhyland-Phaege" is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
Along with the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has also been a problem.
It has gone from an initial €2.2 billion - to an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems in the latest warships are of particular importance in the wake of the warning of the declining strength of the German Navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "running out of deployable ships".
The official said the problem is growing faster as time goes by as old ships are decommissioned, but new ships are not being replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships are capable of entering the Navy.
The National Trust has been leaked information about the secret lives of bats.
New research in the Scottish Highlands has revealed how bats use the land to search for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the unique behaviour of the flying mammal and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study by researchers from the National Trust of Scotland will track the common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Dobbenton bats at Inverieve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special sound systems will be installed at strategic locations on the property to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
A sonic analysis of all phonographs will determine the frequency of calls of bats and determine what species are doing.
A natural habitat map and report will be prepared to provide a comprehensive picture of their behaviour at the geographical scale.
NTS's nature conservation advisor, Rob Dever, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are important for bats and how each species uses them.
The information will help in determining the benefits of natural habitat management activities such as nesting and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically.
They are threatened by the loss of their habitat and natural habitat due to construction and development works.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do certain chemical processes in flypaper and construction materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their night-hunting habits make their ears more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
They use state-of-the-art eco-location techniques to detect insects and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, inspect habitats and occasionally carry out rescue operations.
The organisation established Scotland's first and only dedicated whale reserve at Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
The estate's manager David Thompson said that the estate was an ideal area for him.
"Thrive has a great area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand more about what's needed for their survival".
He stresses the need to screen bats before maintaining the property as it can lead to the unconscious destruction of single-motherhood habitat, which can lead to the death of 400 females and babies, and risk the entire local population being wiped out.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing or molesting them or destroying their habitat is a crime under the law.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged people to help.
She said: "We have a lot to learn about our bats because we don't know the population status of many of our species".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and lawyers prepare to file a lawsuit in a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has promoted rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people use his name to "promote them".
His lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was fined $375,000 for paying her to keep quiet about the incident.
Speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram live video hours after the claim was reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo predicted the report to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a game.
What he said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's common.
They're trying to get a name for themselves, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player said, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which Reuters says they consider "unacceptable accounting of private-sector skepticism".
Lawyer Kristin Schertz said the player could seek "compensation equivalent to the scope of the moral damage of the breach, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent times".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca allegedly went back to the player's room, where he raped her on the rectum.
Mayorca claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo knelt down and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man" and "one percent" disappointed him.
The documents claim that Ronaldo accepted the sexual relationship, but said it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos of her wounds taken in hospital, but then agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "revenge" and was worried about being "publicly humiliated".
Mayorga, 34, says she is now delaying the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and he moved to Italian giants Juventus in a €100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK will be 'perpetually regretful' for its failure to make a profit
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "continue to regret" losing its position as the world leader in car production after Brexit.
He added that "of concern" was that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Barnston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said a no-deal Brexit could hit jobs with a blow to border delays.
The Bernstein plant - where Toyota's Oris and Avancis are manufactured - produced nearly 1,50,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production at our factory shut down", said Marvin Cook, managing director at Toyota in Bernstein.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concern about how cross-border trade would play out if they left the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says they'll shut down their mini-plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of carmakers is that a no-deal Brexit will jeopardize the supply chain.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of "even on time", where spare parts come from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for cars built on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal before 29 March, there could be upheaval at the border, and the industry believes spare parts could be delayed and shortaged.
It will be impossible for Toyota to hold inventory at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and the company says this will result in production being halted.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Checks Plan for future relations with the EU was "strictly fragmented" to avoid those checks at the border.
"We need a deal for us to be done. We want a better deal, as I said, for now we don't just want to be happy with it being a success, but we want to be able to take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC4's Today programme.
And the proof is not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, for whom we need to maintain this story, so that the supply chain is very successful.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, it warned that rising costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and of course affect jobs.
Peter Suvallarius, who worked at Barnstone for 24 years and is a United Union convener at the plant, said his members are deeply concerned: "In my experience once their jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be extended again.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back another week due to ongoing disputes over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which includes investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's allies and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors have been circulating in Washington for months that Trump will or will not show the deputy attorney general a way out, and that Mueller's freedom may be at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had planted a wire to record a conversation with Trump that could have removed the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and there was talk about his resignation.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not "like" Rosenstein to be removed, but the meeting was extended to avoid him facing a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was to have heard testimony from both Kwan and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kwanou, further extending the vote of the entire Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There is no date set for it, it could be this week, I think it could be pushed back another week given other issues going on with the Supreme Court.
But, we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists argued that this was confirmed by the fact that Sanders had not given a statement to the White House press since September 10.
The organizer, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said there was no animosity about the TV journalists' "performance" for the lack of commentary, adding: "I'm not denying the fact that they're faking it".
He later suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"This president hosts more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, and then added without providing evidence: "We've seen those numbers".
The comments will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me".
We try very hard to do that, and you've seen it over the last few weeks, and when you talk to the president of the United States, it's going to replace the press.
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting high officials.
Press conferences are rarely held alone.
This week in New York, the president may have given a reason for his carelessness and bizarre presentation to the assembled press.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the cost of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in the public services for which it is responsible.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "All summer, the UK and the EU have been negotiating on a withdrawal, which is expected to be decided in the autumn.
But the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate that I value the contribution of every member of the working class, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring invaluable skills and experience, which strengthen and improve healthcare delivery, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
After suffering a head injury, Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores in Saturday's game, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters he was injured just before the half.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed", Reed said.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for further diagnosis.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "we don't yet know the type or extent of the injury", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, was playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had taken a total of five tackles on Saturday before the current game, bringing his total to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty for purchasing property in the UK and the extra money will be used for the homeless under the New Tory scheme.
This move would undermine the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp duty will be levied on people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
For the help of the homeless - the Treasury is expected to add up to 12 crore pounds a year.
Theresa May will announce today that she is preparing to charge higher stamp duty on foreign buyers to buy property in the UK, with the extra money raised to be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to overcome the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will fuel the government's campaign to help people sleeping on the streets.
Surcharge  Added to the higher levels imposed on other houses two years ago, this will be accompanied by the present stamp duty and the purchase for rent can be up to 3 per cent more expensive.
The move is expected to add up to 12 crore pounds a year to the Treasury.
According to one estimate, 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up their prices and makes it harder for first time home buyers to take the plunge.
Many of the most active sectors of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson's stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of buying land but not using it, which drives up property prices, and he urged Mrs May to remove the affordable housing reservation, so as to end the "depreciation" of homes in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of eye-catching housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions without fail.
He also wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I would sacrifice my Prime Ministership to restore the dreams of the British people - each new generation - for a better life.
And that means restoring the collapsed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, buying a home will not be as easy for non-UK residents as it is for hardworking British residents and companies based abroad.
For many, the dream of owning a dream home has become a distant dream, and the stigma of living on the streets has become a reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to be Scotland manager.
Sunderland owner Jack Ross said his "ultimate goal" is to one day become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scott, enjoying challenges as the North-East club revitalise, and are three points clear of the top spot in third place in League One.
He has moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But as a little boy, I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father, and that has always fascinated me.
That opportunity will only come when I succeed in managing the club.
Ross was preceded as manager of Sunderland by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic owner said he was not afraid to go after such well-established names at such a big club when his offers were rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At this point, my success will be measured by whether I can take this club to the Premier League.
He said that due to the infrastructure and facilities in the club, the club is undoubtedly eligible to enter the Premier League.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but if I can get the club back there, then maybe I'll consider myself successful.
After a 15-month period as assistant owner at Dumbarton and training staff at Hearts, Ross's managerial career has only been three years.
He later helped Alloa improve from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren to the Champions Trophy from relegation in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more satisfied than ever with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
They remember that accepting the weight of the aloe was like thinking, "Maybe it was really square".
I really think management was more suited to me, more than playing.
It seems strange because I played the right game, made a decent living out of it, and enjoyed some decent top spots.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still go through stressful and stressful situations at work, but management still seems to be the right fit for me.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I've been most satisfied in my entire adult life working on my own passion.

According to the survey, the correct time for drinking alcohol is 5.30 pm on Saturday.
The summer heat has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but has added to the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars grew by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants saw a decline of 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the Business Advisory Centre CGA who compiled the figures said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July also repeated the pattern of the previous June, with pubs' turnover up 2.8 per cent, barring further blow to restaurants.
The decline in restaurant business of 1.8 per cent in June increased further in July.
Pubs and bars, which served more drinks than restaurants, performed very strongly.
Even the pubs that served food, though not as dramatically as the restaurant operators, were also weakened by the sun.
It seemed that people only went out to drink.
Sales of drinks in well-managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food consumption fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "We are seeing these results as a trend that has been going on since late April.
When it comes to sales in external markets, weather and important social or sporting events are the most effective factors.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are struggling, although the 4.8 percent decline from last year will be especially painful given the current cost pressure.
The long hot summer should not have come at a time when it was a tough time for drivers selling groceries and only time will tell if the moderate temperatures we experienced in August can provide much needed relief.
Including new openings, overall sales growth in July at pubs and restaurants was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-out.
The Copper Peach Tracker Industry for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which has a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is an established industry benchmark, monitors sales from 47 driver groups and collects data on their performance and analyses it.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents and teachers, the survey revealed.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has caused a huge stir that it is posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said their main account was to show their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- are creating social media accounts, keeping them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that fake Instagram accounts are growing at a rapid pace, a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has caused a huge stir that it is posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said their main account was cleared to show their parents, and they also had private accounts.
A mother was stunned when she saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, where she was begging others to "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Council of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds had two acquaintances, and half of them admitted to maintaining a private account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "So many teenagers are eager to create online places that it is very sad to see that their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Ilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Aylydh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most renowned track and field athletes and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for the sport's operators to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
Ailidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and global athletic communities and we are confident that bringing him on board will greatly benefit the players in Scotland.
Doyle said: "I am eager to be a voice for the players and I hope I can contribute and guide the sport in Scotland".
The American who won four of his Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after suffering a transit ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that only time would tell if I would recover or not.
It was exhausting, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I exercise agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
Online votes were divided over a breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows.
Online votes were divided over an ad by a breast pump company comparing breastfeeding women to dairy cows.
In launching what is believed to be the world's first quiet, usable breast pump, consumer tech company Alviny released a satirical music video ad featuring the freedom of breastfeeding mothers to use new pumps.
Four real mothers in a barn full of cow dung dance to the rhythm of the song: "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not a mole, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on to sing: "Pump this, pump this, I'm feeding babies, pump this, pump this, I'm sucking my women's milk".
However, the advert posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of shares, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many feeling it understated the dairy industry's resilience.
It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Except that their baby is taken away from them within days of giving birth, they get pregnant and give birth to the baby to give milk, just like us", she wrote.

Another commented: "Of course, it is a nuisance for both mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?
Another wrote: "This is an irrelevant ad".
While others supported the ad, one woman admitted that the song was "funny".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have taken one.
I felt like a cow because of the pumping.
This ad is a little crazy, but I feel it's right for what it's for.
This is an unusual product, wrote one.
Another commented: "This funny ad is for mothers who pump (usually in their workplace or bathroom) and feel like cows".
This is not an advertisement that is praising or speculating on the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, she reveals that a group of women were dancing with pumps neatly fitted in their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the view of many women who use breast pumps to feel like cows.
However, the LV pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits perfectly into the nursing bra, allowing women freedom of movement, holding babies and even going outside during pumping.
Partner and ECD at Mother, Anna Ballarin, expressed the opinion: The LV pump is a revolutionary product, which needs to be launched in an open and exciting manner.
We wanted to bring to light breast pumping and all its challenges by showing the similarities between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, by demonstrating the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pumps offer us, in an interesting and relevant way.
This is not the first time that LV pump has been in the news.
During the London fashion disaster, a mother of two was seen catwalking using this product for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children moved peacefully to tent camps on the Texas border.
Although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of immigrant children in custody increased in part, because of the harsh language and policies put forth by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and, when they come forward to adopt a child, they fear jeopardizing their own ability to maintain themselves in that country.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to take their fingerprints, and that data would be turned over to immigration officials.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Matthew Albanes testified before Congress, in which he said the agency arrested a handful of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal, and a large proportion of them are involved in criminal activities.
So we have started tracking such people", said Mr. Albanes.
To speed up the process of children, officials introduced new rules, according to shelter workers, some of whom will have to appear in court within a month of being taken into custody, instead of the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will appear in person to file their petition for legal status before the Immigration Judge through video conferencing instead.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be immediately removed from the country.
According to reports from shelter workers and income from the system in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more anxious or desperate they can become, leading to violent tendencies or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that those problems are particularly acute in large facilities like Tornillo, where the large number of children there, the neglected children, are found to be struggling extraordinarily.
He added that the children being taken to tent cities are being given no time to get emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to their friends, which is causing additional trauma to the already struggling children.
Syria has asked the US, French and Turkish "extensive military forces" to leave the country immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem also called for the Syrian surrenderers to return home even though the war in the country has now reached its eighth year.
Mouleim, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign military forces on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism are illegal, and will be treated fairly.
He urged them to leave the country immediately and without any conditions.
Mouleim stressed that the "war on terror" in Syria is now almost over, with 360,000 people killed since 2011 and millions displaced.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight the holy war until all Syrian terrorists and any foreign entity of the terrorist group are cleared.
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the question of surrender, Mouleim said that he had favorable conditions for returning, but he blamed some foreign countries for spreading unjustified fear, which led to the surrender being shunned.
We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return, he said.
They are politicizing what should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction assistance unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the rebels to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold of Balakhia has given journalists a chance to pre-empt political news.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army on the region, which has a population of three million.
However, Mouleim stressed that the agreement had a "clearly defined time frame" and expressed hope that the military action would target and root out jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.
UN Ambassador Stéphane de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members will soon be held to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mouleimani laid out conditions for the Syrian government's inclusion in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to reviewing the current constitutional order and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that argument, as many liberals would probably hope, the impeachment and unfortunate incident would bring his presidency to an early end, but if it doesn't, Mr. Trump will win reelection in 2020.
There is no doubt that this will be the most dramatic presidential final ever!
To date, there are no signs of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings from CNN have doubled to 1.05 million, while prime-time ratings from MSNBC have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nelson, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and topped MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show cable ratings, which was watched by 3.5 million viewers on Major News Nights.
"It's a fire that people are being drawn to, because it's not something that we understand", said Neil Baer, director of the ABC drama Designated Supreme, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovel, a well-known comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, had a different theory for the idea.
She recalls a trip to a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Miss Scovel told me.
There is a value in entertainment in this mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storyline from Washington will determine the fate of Raw V, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's also a mind-blowing thought even to an informed citizen, when you watch a panel of experts at 6 a.m. debate, including Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 oyster-leather bomber jacket (a thick cloth with hooves, the Washington Post said), and Stormy Daniel's suggestive, meaningful, graphic description of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario again the way I did before.
Speaking about the changing cast of Trump's show and the daily plot twists (which he praised Kim Jong-un for, and quarrelled with the NFL about), Brent Montague Marie, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of PON STARS, said, "Seeing a fraction of what they do, I think they're delivering something every night through a reality show".
You can't miss a single part, because that leaves you behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleas's house this week, it was a beautiful sunny day outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, with a temperature of 80 degrees, but he was immersed in watching CNN recording MSNBC.
They couldn't keep themselves away from him, not from Brett Kwan, who is ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is in doubt.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the daytime and people were saying, "Western civilization is beginning to fall", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out to be true.

The money flows in the very tight midterm election house race.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania is seeing a 17th cash flood, which is responsible for the congressional redistricting that put two candidates in the race for the same seat.
It recently re-elected Democratic Republican Connor Lamb in a suburban Pittsburgh district who won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stood in front of the other candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who was currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which was largely filled with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally unfairly made in favor of Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race for the new 17th started a campaign of economic struggle between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), the main party's financial side.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow marginal victory in a widely-watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
Political pundits gave a little leverage to the Democrats.
The US decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but then changed its mind.
Diplomats noted that after a slight retreat from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and until he was fired as a partner on the Trump Organization management team, he owned a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials recalled the US Chief of Diplomatic Missions over the recent decision by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama not to recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But only a fine was considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $14 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hurt the Central American country, which has a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meeting progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar summit last year, which was seen as a step in an effort to stem the flow of migrants toward the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration made clear that it wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the summit, which is now set for mid-October and the call for administrative areas to attend the summit, diplomats said.
And without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington, all three American ambassadors peacefully returned to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to provide details of the talks, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss the internal consultations on terms of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also, spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next inevitable event could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now ample evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign is conspiring with Russia in his attack on his election.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that institution, when he is preparing to go before voters once again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peers.
There are many ifs and buts, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's defeat is inevitable or that his counterparts in Europe's defeat is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, if the West had opposed Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, German officials were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid bloodshed in the coming year.
The study of history has been centered around such issues of disagreement and the relentless march of democracy has been accelerated or delayed.
The United States is now struggling with some of these issues of disagreement.
What if Mr. Trump fires Vice President General Rod Rosenstein, who was handling Mr. Mueller's investigation?
He has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that Rosenstein had the idea of secretly recording the president last year and that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenshett says the Times account is wrong.
What exactly are we going to do if the newly-opened FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is sent to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonesty?
Besides, we're going to have a midterm election for Congress and Mr. Trump will be held accountable for it?
But if we fail in this, democracy will be buried deep for a long time.
But I'm confident that we won't fail because I learned a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had to be deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who had once occupied my embassy.
But she survived, moved to the States, and 60 years later, she dared me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table with the swastika.
This is my history, so why can't I be positive about the future?

The Rapid Vienna was organized by Rangers on Thursday.
The team is looking to qualify for the Europa League Group G after a dramatic draw with Villarreal in Spain this month following their win over Austria.
Graham Dorrance missed a strong start to the season with a knee injury, but believes the 2-2 draw against Villarreal should be seen as a start to another brilliant performance by Rangers.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good game for us because Villarreal is a strong team".
We started the game thinking that we would do something good and get points.
"Maybe we could have done it in the end, but overall, the draw was probably the right decision.
They were probably better in the first half and we came in the second half and were on top.
Thursday is starting, another big night in Europe.
"Hopefully we will get three points but it will be a tough game because even though their scores are good in the last match, I am sure with the support of the people we have, we will definitely achieve positive results.
"Last year was really difficult, in all aspects, with the injury and the change in the club, but still, this place is a good thing.
The team is good and the kids are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Fortunately, we can now try to do that, to get past the past and succeed".
This fear of retirement savings has disrupted the sleep of women.
Despite having a clear idea of how to care for the survey participants, some people were talking to their family members.
In a nationwide study, nearly half of the people said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the children we talked to said that.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they're not taking any steps to communicate about it", said Holly Schneider, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
Start here.
Talk to your mate and children about this: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them ahead of time what you want.
Consult with your counselor and discuss with your family where and how to care, so that the choice of these can be a key factor in determining costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: A financial advisor can suggest ways to pay for these expenses.
Your fund options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets.
Get your legal paperwork ready: Finish legal matters ahead of time.
Get a healthcare proxy so you can appoint a trusted person to manage your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your financial matters.
You will need to choose a trusted person for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and need to be taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Keep all these details in writing so that you are prepared.
"This picture is not just about money, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan ahead for this".
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe.
One man was shot multiple times by an air rifle while returning home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officials described the exact shooting, which occurred at around 2:30 BST, as a "reckless act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
He was not seriously injured and police have appealed to witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, with officials saying the death toll is likely to rise.
Due to the loss of contact, relief officials were unable to get any information from Dongla Regency, which lies north of Palu and was the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Key facts about Palu and Dongla on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongla is a regency located 300 km (180 mi) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, the province that falls under the administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but it is more concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, in the past 100 years, there have been several tsunamis in the region.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the western hills, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years include:
2004: On December 26, 2004, a massive earthquake struck the western coast of Aceh Province, North Sumatra, Indonesia, causing a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami struck the southern coast of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Mentawai Island in Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the PD Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing much destruction and creating an atmosphere of fear, with its destruction reminding people of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died when buildings collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and trapped thousands of tourists for a while.
Sarah Paulin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by Alaska state officials, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charges of interfering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report a crime, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is being remanded to the Mart-Su pretrial facility and is being held on a $500 bail bond, KTUU reported.
According to media reports, he was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when questioned.
Palin faces a third-degree felony, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also previously charged with a second-degree felony, which carries a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Paulin.
His mother, Sarah Pauline, had called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence crime reporting, and possession of drug paraphernalia in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's service in Iraq to PTSD and violent behavior.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, and thousands of homes were destroyed.
Power and communication are cut off in the coming days and the death toll is likely to rise.
The epicenter was far from Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact of that moment are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people were gathered on the beach in the city of Palamu to celebrate when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demanding a harsher death penalty for suspected New York terrorist attack
The death penalty is being sought for New York federal prosecutor Syflow Sypov, a suspect in a New York terrorist attack that killed eight people - the most severe sentence the state has imposed on a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a rented home depot truck to attack a two-wheeler road near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
To qualify for the death penalty for the purpose of the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight and inflicted serious bodily harm on "Sahetu".
According to court documents, the death penalty can be accepted in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with the aid of racketeering.
Describing what Saipov did as "abominable, cruel and degrading", the lawyer said the attack required "significant planning and foresight".
"Seflo Habibulvevich Sipov inflicted injury, injury and damage to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Paganuko".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York has been handling a death penalty case for a decade.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed in a New York state trial two years earlier on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told investigators that he was inspired to attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police say he requested to have an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the alleged 22-count charge.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Sipov, said he was "completely disappointed" by the prosecution's ruling.
"We believe that imposing the death penalty, accepting any demand for life imprisonment, would increase the suffering of all those involved", Patton said.
The defense team of Saipov had earlier asked prosecutors not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
During the Tory Council protests Nigel Farage vowed to establish an organisation of the 'people's army'.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should be wary of Eurosceptics - as Theresa May's MP suggested, they should have the negotiating hand with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told a crowd in Birmingham that the UK would have "gone through this" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
However, the obstacles she faces in bridging the divide in Mrs May's group have been made more clear by separate anti-Brexit demonstrations by Remain Tory supporters in the city.
Even in the midst of a storm of criticism from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU, they are having to learn to keep their checkered promises to a steady schedule.
The Allies say they should try to establish relations with Brussels despite opposition and pressure the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their proposed plan or 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone made it clear to the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'end his relationship with the Checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be brought along and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If they had these formulas, we would be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP said: "I will stand by Brexit, but we must get the checkers out".
Regarding his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not enter the world war to get second place".
We want our laws in our country.
Denying that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election, Mr Bone said: "The idea that British people have changed their minds, their demands and now they want to stay in this system is wrong".
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkins was also present at the rally, telling reporters: "All I can say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There is anger among the general public against the Checkers, the opposition will not vote for them, there is also an anti-Checker atmosphere in our party and among our activists who have chosen this path by electing us to the highest position.
Please, leave the checkered ones and start listening to others.
In a clear message to Mrs May, he said: 'The Prime Minister can only keep his word if he keeps his word.'
Addressing the Front, Shri Faraz said that politicians who want to betray the 2016 elections should be punished.
Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people and our political class, he added.
They are betraying Brexit, and we want to tell them today, right here, right now, that we will not let you do that.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I think you should teach this lesson to our politicians who are trying to betray Brexit, who are going down that path".
"We are building an army of the people of this country, and this army will win us Brexit, and it will not be healthy until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the remaining marchers marched on Birmingham before a two-hour march through the city centre.
This weekend, some activists formed a group and held signs protesting Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, considered a friend of the Labour Party, put the Conservatives on edge over security issues in the party app as the conference began.
These are the same people who tell us that the IT system is working well and all these technologies will make Canada Plus Plus, peace at the border, free trade without borders in Ireland and many other things like that", he said.
This is all a fake.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren will seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrats were speaking about their plans for the future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a consistent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff DL, who also co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There is a lot of talk that he will be running against Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting, held on Saturday in Holyoke after Trump took office, was the 36th meeting with voters to follow the town hall method.
A member here asked him if he was considering running for the presidency.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington to keep our government in check, and that means women in top positions".
One man arrested in connection with LSU's Sims murder
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said it had arrested 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
The police had released a video of the shooting and asked for the identity of the person who appeared in the video footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning outside the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, according to 247Sports.
Wade jumped in to save his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during police interrogation, that he was at the scene, that he had a weapon, and that he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was easily arrested by police and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6, dynamic junior basketball player, Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton Yow, who took the field on the team's orders, defeated Sebastian Vettel to win the world championship.
It was only when Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday with more points than Lewis Hamilton that it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would now be important in the race.
Botas had a good start from the pole, replacing Hamilton in the first two turns and almost knocking Hamilton out, giving Vettel time to beat his own teammate.
Hamilton left the end of the pack in traffic and went into the pits first, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes then fought back to push Vettel into the back of the grid, but after some very interesting moments Hamilton took the lead and the Ferrari driver was forced to unintentionally clear the inside, risking a double move for third place.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first stage of the race, which was painted on his 21st birthday.
He then spent most of the race with more grip on his car, and moved to the finish line, beating Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally got into the pits in lap 44, but with Ryokan in fourth place, he was unable to increase his speed.
It was a really tough day, but Valterie did a great job and he's a very gentlemanly guy.
The team has done a fantastic job to get one two", said Hamilton.
This is really bad behavior.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual harassment by Christine Blase Ford, but Senator Diane Feinstein has claimed that she has not released the letter from Ford accusing him.
Speaking at the West Virginia meeting, the President directly referred to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, noting that what was happening in the Senate was showing how "selfish, irritable and lying" people had become.
"What's been going on in the Senate these last few days, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on in the Senate, what's going on the Senate, what's going on the Senate, what's going on the Sen's going on".
"You see the flyers, you leak them and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'"
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dane Feinstein, did you leak this?
And I remember his answer -- did you leak the documents -- "What, what did you say?"
Oh, no. I was just...
I didn't leak it.
Ah, wait a minute.
"Did we leak it... no, we didn't"... The president made the statement in the style of a senator.
The letter, which Ford sent to Feinstein in July about the allegations against Kavanaugh, was leaked in early September... although Feinstein denies it was leaked from his office.
Feinstein told the committee that while he did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, he did not leak his letter, The Hill reported.
They told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it that way.
The president, however, was not impressed by their refusal, and he told the board on Saturday night: "I tell you, this is very bad behavior".
Maybe they didn't, but it was the worst behavior I've ever seen.
In his defense of the Supreme Court representative who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the Chairman said that these Democrats are using the allegations to their advantage.
They want to regain power by whatever means necessary.
You see the selfishness, the rudeness, they don't care if they hurt someone, they don't care who they crush to gain power and dominance", the president said, according to Meditech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants won by defeating the United States in the final.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for their Elite League defeat on Friday by beating Belfast Giants 5-3 in Saturday's return match.
The Giants had an immediate two-goal lead with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bouvillier scoring early in the game.
Dwyer had tied the host team by Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Dundi was equalised by Francois Bouchard and then the team won with a goal from Lucas Lundwald Nielsen.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's side, who had come out on top by beating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 of the first half, four minutes into the game, with an assist from Kendall McFaul. Bowielier scored again four minutes later, with an assist from David Rutherford, doubling the lead.
The opening half of the match was full of action. Sullivan kept the hosts' challenge with a goal in the 13th-10th minute, while Cooney scored a goal in the 15th-16th minute to tie the game with the help of Matt Marquardt.
Dwyer scored his second goal late in the first period, suggesting the Giants had regained the lead in the first break.
"The Jaymans once again played their strategy and in the 27th and 37th minute, Boukard scored a power play goal to tie the game once again".
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen score and Dundee took the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period. He scored the fifth goal in the final period of the match to secure the team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will now play their next home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller who saved hundreds of passengers from an earthquake has died.
An air traffic controller who narrowly escaped death after a plane carrying hundreds of passengers was confirmed to have taken off safely has become a hero for Indonesia.
The earthquake that hit Sulawesi on Friday killed 800 people and left many missing, and triggered a tsunami.
The whole area has been devastated by the tremors and many people in the town of Palu are trapped under rubble.
The control tower at the Muttiara Sisi Al Zufri airport in Palu was shaken by the earthquake. Although other comrades fled the tower for fear of their lives, 21-year-old Antonis Gunvan Agung refused to leave his position.
Batik Air Flight 6321 was on the runway at the time and did not move to ensure safe takeoff.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower after realizing that it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
The decision may have saved hundreds of lives, said Johannes Sirat, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, as reported by ABC News in Australia.
We had equipped a helicopter at Balikappan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are deeply saddened to hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, the administration is concerned that the death toll could reach the 1000 mark, with all parts of Donggala, Singhi and Baotong being difficult to reach, the emergency management agency said.
"The death toll is likely to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the rubble and we have not been able to reach them", the agency spokesperson said.
Waves of up to 6 meters have devastated the city of Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing relief and essential supplies.
"Every minute, the body carrier is bringing bodies", said Risa Kusuma, 35, who told Sky News.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere".
"The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will get there", said Jan Gelfond, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia.
This is already a very sad situation, but it could be even worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to the deportation.
Are you ready? CNN reported this.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea now says one man is missing after a plane crashed in the Gulf.
The airline that operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean Gulf of Micronesia now says one passenger is missing after the crash, and it had earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew on board had been safely evacuated.
A press release issued by Air New Guinea said that as of Saturday afternoon, the airline had not found a male passenger.
We are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigating bodies to locate the person.
When asked for more details such as the passenger's age or nationality, the airline did not immediately respond.
The plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Fallujah, and local boats helped rescue passengers and crew.
Seven people have been taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six of the passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all are in stable condition, the airline said.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed before it reached the runway.
Some eyewitnesses believe that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janice said the plane went too low.
Janice said, "It was a really good thing.
Janice said that she and other passengers were able to exit the sinking plane through an emergency exit and walk through waist-deep water.
He said the crew was scared and screaming and had minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that some of the crew members who were working on the nearby wreck were also involved in the rescue operation. They took the crew to the shore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank, which sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
The Aviation Safety Network has found that 111 people have died in accidents involving aircraft of PNG-registered carriers in the last two years, but not a single aircraft of Air New Guinea.
Analysts have described the events of the night the woman was burned alive.
The governor's party on Saturday completed its argument in a trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the US Department of Justice, testified for an hour as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he checked cell phone records to find out exactly what happened between her and 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis the night that 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers died.
Rowlett said they combined location data from several cell phones to determine if Telles was with her on the evening of Chambers' death. Telles has previously claimed she was not with her that evening, Clarion Leisure reported.
The available data shows that his cell phone was near Chambers's cell phone at the time, and Teles said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by Sanford about Telles' claims that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said Telles was lying, saying his truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another difference was that we knew her two weeks before Chambers died, Telles said.
Cell phone records show that they had only known each other for a week.
At some point after Chambers' death, Telles deleted her messages, calls, contact information from his phone, Rowlett said.
"He cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defence will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The case is expected to go before the jury on the same day, the judge said.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
By filling their music with positive messages, the hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre.
Bristol-based High Breed claims that hip hop has strayed from its original purpose of addressing political messages as well as social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists from groups like Fugees and Common have seen the UK revolt through the work of Akala and Lookie.
Another black person?!
A nanny in New York sued a couple for being cut from their work based on a "racist" message.
"A nanny couple in New York is suing for being fired for being racist after a mother mistakenly sent them a message complaining that she is "another black person".
The couple has denied the accusation of racism, claiming that the lawsuit is a form of "scapegoating".
Lynsey Placebo-Flexman, a mother of two, was displeased when the new caregiver first came on the job in 2016 and discovered she was black.
"NASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS another black man too", wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Morris, also twice.
After noticing the mess, the "disappointed" Pwasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, who had been an African-American nanny and was doing a bad job, adding that she now wanted a Filipino nanny, reports the New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, the couple is suing Mrs. Morris for a reduction in pay, claiming $350 a day for six months, with the promise of a full-time job, but no agreement.
"I want to show them that you can't do this", she told the Post on Friday. "I know, it's racist", she added.
The couple denied the allegation of racism and claimed that Mrs. Morris was no longer trustworthy because of the hurt she had suffered and that it was only reasonable to fire her.
"My wife mistakenly sent them something she didn't want to say".
It's not racism.
We are not racist", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But, after you've been rude to someone, would you hand over the children to the same person?
Would you hand over your newborn baby to that person?
It's not possible".
Accusing the case of being a form of "screaming", Plasco said his wife had given birth to a baby two months ago and was currently in "extremely difficult circumstances".
"Does anyone follow someone like that?"
"This is not a very good thing", said Plasco, an investment banker by profession.
While the court case is still ongoing, the court of appeal has been critical of the couple through social media, strongly criticizing their behavior and arguments.
Paddington's publishers were concerned that readers would not accept the idea of a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to know what the mood will be for someone who reads it for the first time before it comes out".
It's very interesting to see what we know about Paddington's tremendous success".
She says the father, who wrote children's books inspired by a teddy bear after working as a cameraman for the BBC, would have remained optimistic if the book had been rejected.
She describes Paddington as "a very important member of our family", and she says that her father is very proud of what he has achieved.
"They were very quiet. They never wanted to blink themselves", she said.
"But Paddington was like a real person to them, so if your son achieved something, you were proud of it, even if it wasn't really your achievement.
I think that's how they looked at Paddington's success.
It was his invention and his imagination, but he always credited Paddington".
My daughter was doing her final grade and I had to call her off.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Louvre Pasteur Two Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life but to no avail.
"Nad was calling me regularly and saying that the situation was very bad. She didn't think she would get out of it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laprouj.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I wanted to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye to her.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping was slowly wearing off and her whole system was shutting down.
She had just died and everything was coming to a halt.
I just wanted to sit back and wait, and see how it all unfolded.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by so many families and people.
I really had to take care of myself".
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Laplace sat on the plane with other passengers mourning the loss of her daughter, with no idea of which light she was passing through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was down on my knees, tears streaming down my face.
It's a little hard to explain, but I felt a little sympathy for Nad on the plane.
He needed my love, I needed to understand him.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women in mourning post cards to prevent suicide from the bridge.
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are now working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspirational messages and phone numbers on Welsh Bridge, where people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler had been depressed since he was 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to have the time to go through what I go through every day", she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, and her son was a rising chef with a smile that would make anyone smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone always said that his smile would make any place shine".
He had, however, given up work before his death because he "was really living in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler committed suicide, and his brother, who was 11 at the time, watched him die.
Mrs. David said: "I am still worried that something indirect will happen to him".
Mrs. David made the cards, "to let these people know that there are people you can go to, that you can talk to.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphries and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years. Mrs. Humphries lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, who also killed himself shortly after his mother's death.
"He never said he was depressed, he never said anything", she said.
"A few days after Christmas, we noticed a slight change in his attitude.
He had no money in his pocket on Christmas Day - he avoided the children's eyes when they opened their presents".
She said that his death was a huge shock to her family, but we got through it. "It caused a rift in the family.
This split us up.
But all we have to do is keep moving forward and keep fighting".

Now, as the FBI begins its investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is a little bit on the line.
"I thought if we really got something like what he was asking for - a time-bound investigation, limited opportunities - then maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Fleck said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "breaking" into the party's gridlock habit.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is simply due to time.
There are only six weeks until the midterm elections, which are on November 6th -- if, as expected, the Republicans perform poorly, their efforts to send the man they chose to the nation's highest court will be very weak.
In order to build a supporting base for Mr. Kavanaugh, Bushney picked up the phone to call Senator George W. Bush, who was working for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits a report?
51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote in the current Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to pull the plug and keep him on the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's leadership, the number of North Korean infiltrators has decreased.
South Korean lawmakers say the number of North Korean infiltrators entering South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Unification Ministry, Park Byung-sung said there were 1,127 intrusions last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strong border controls between North Korea and China and the high money raised from human trafficking were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many North Korean infiltrators have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally at the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many grew up in China, which has a large border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross that border than to cross the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats illegal immigrants as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and forcibly returns them.
The relationship between North and South - despite still being technically at war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on non-nuclear weapons.
This followed a historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, which discussed a wide range of issues on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blasted the lack of progress since then on U.S. sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be confident in our national security, and we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves", Reay said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "crazy" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "unconscious" and said he was temporarily unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I can't do anything about it, but I think if a woman did it, they would call her 'unconscious,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
When Kavanaugh began to speak, he was very angry, sometimes screaming, sometimes with a tightness in his throat, when he talked about his family and high school days.
The accusation against him, which he united to express anger at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election, was clearly blamed on the Democrats as a "coordinated murder of character and strangeness".
Pelosi has said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it proved that he was biased toward Democrats.
"I think they have disqualified themselves by their statements and by following Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
She seemed reluctant to be asked if Pelosi would question her legitimacy if Kavanaugh was appointed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"All I'm going to say is -- if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not only not fit to be on the Supreme Court, they're not fit to be on the court they're on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about the handling of Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade potential lawsuit against her, because Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Mr. Kavanaugh left out the question of whether you would ignore some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time for some ignorant, biased man to go to court and expect you to say, 'Wow, that's great!'" Pelosi said.
And women need to use their weapons.
This right voice is raised, months and years pass and she has no choice but to cry.
"You cry when you're angry", Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
She added, "I got a lot of support from a woman who worked as an executive somewhere, who said she was so angry that she wanted to cry, but she developed a technique where when she started to scream and cry, she would say to the man she was talking to, "Think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm pissed off".
And then she kept on saying it.
And I thought, "This is amazing".
Tears are allowed as a way to vent anger because there are fundamental misconceptions about them.
One of my fondest memories of my early work was in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying uncomfortably angry, when an elderly woman - a cold-blooded manager I had always feared - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs to the wall.
"Don't let them ever see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy about it.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business, Mrs. Schroeder became so frustrated that she began to wonder why she herself should not run for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", she told me after 30 years, smiling.
"There are already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they want is another candidate.
Some call it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
"They were behind in raising funds because of the campaign's delay, and so they decided not to enter the fight until they had raised $2 million".
It was a losing war.
She found that her supporters who gave men $1,000 gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she thought to herself.
The emotions that were so stirring when he announced he would not launch a formal campaign - gratitude for the people who supported him, anger at the system that made it difficult to raise money, and anger at representatives and gender rather than voters - made him stronger.
"You might have thought I was a little bit of a wreck", said Mrs. Schroeder of the symbolism the newspapers gave her.
"You might have thought that Klinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"Did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
With the US and China trade war on the roar, and with no sign of an end to the war, experts say the gap between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump has issued his first warning by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The increase has been made even more dramatic this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth, effectively taxing all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has resisted each time, imposing tariffs of five to 10 percent on imports of US goods, compared to the most recent 60 billion dollars.
China has vowed to follow in the footsteps of the US and soon the world's largest economy will never be ignored.
Withdrawing Washington would be a demand, but publicly greeting the United States would be a very disturbing thing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game properly, China can provide positive support in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies under the pressure of trade wars with the US.
In fact, the economic cycle that will begin in one of the two countries if political decisions are made quickly in Washington or Beijing is more dangerous than people previously assumed", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
The foreign minister says Syria is "ready" to return refugees.
Syria is ready to voluntarily return refugees and they have asked for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation in our region is more stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
To improve the normalcy of the situation, the Government has started rehabilitation in areas devastated by terrorists.
The conditions are now in place for voluntary repatriation of refugees who have been forced to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of philanthropy.
Al-Ma'lem said the Syrian government would help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the armed supporting countries.
Europe seals the Ryder Cup in Paris
At Le Golf National outside Paris, France, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has lost six straight in European countries, and they haven't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The team of Danish captain Thomas Bajern won the European crown again, scoring 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson struggled in many competitions, submerging his T-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole to face Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari became the first player in four to shine in all of his fairs and lead 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The lowest ranked player in the European league, Denmark's Thorbjørn Olesen, knocked out American Jordan Spieth by 5 points to 4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played for the final Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy that I got the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy that I was able to help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his countryman John Rahm who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, the man I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
"An odd statistic predicted by one of the greatest athletes of all time, Jack Nicklaus won only 14 major titles".
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, the highest-performing golfers in the entire tournament, Team USA traveled the entire weekend to find a fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented on his team's disappointing performance, saying, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, when it was time, we tried to put pressure on the European Union.
We fought with a knife.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great games.
"We'll re-match the team, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 and I am proud to serve as captain.
You should admire them.
We got out.
Red Tide Update: Concentrations of pinellas, manatees and mustard decreased significantly.
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the state of the Patchier Bloom is being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which is causing the concentrations to decline.
Red Tide has stretched 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Patches are found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites than last week.
Red tide has also been reported in Pasco County.
"In the past week, central concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County or on the coast, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hialeah County, high concentrations from the background in Manatee County, high concentrations from the background on the main road or coastline in Sarasota County, moderate concentrations from the background in Charlotte County, high concentrations from the background in Lee County or on the coast and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are ongoing reports of respiratory distress in Pinellas, Manette, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory distress was reported in northwest Florida last week.
