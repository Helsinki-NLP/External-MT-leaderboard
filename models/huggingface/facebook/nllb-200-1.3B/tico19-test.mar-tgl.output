How long have these symptoms been present?
And all chest pains should be treated this way, especially for our age.
And even with a fever.
You should also check your cholesterol, blood pressure.
"Une fièvre à la fois?"
"Are you having chest pains?"
And also, do you have trouble breathing?
Can you tell me what other symptoms you're having?
And how high your fever was.
And I have a cough.
And I have a little cold and cough.
And actually, I'm having a little chest pain today.

And that makes my chest hurt.
And I think I have a little fever.
And I want to hear from you a description of where the chest hurts.
And they have a little fever.

And I feel like my chest is about to get crushed.
And people cough in front of me all the time.
And you have chest pains.
You said that this is the pressure in your chest.

Do you breathe properly?
The chest pain made me forget completely.
Do you feel like someone is pressing your chest?
Do you still feel like you're being bullied?
Has he complained of getting sick from the same symptoms?
Do you have other chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, or other similar problems?
Do you have any other unfortunate problems like diabetes?
Do you have a chest pain or a headache?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have a rush?
Do you know what symptoms she has?
Can you see this image?
"I'm a big boy", he said.
I've been tested for diabetes, though.
She's experiencing the same symptoms as me.

The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom is increasing rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is similar across the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across countries, although the steps vary by country.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should increase their preparedness for the rapidly increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare and especially ultra-efficient treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown morphology was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

The disease was named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), as it was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Evidence so far has shown that 80% of individuals infected with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and the majority of these individuals have recovered.
14% of cases are more severe with hospitalization, whereas 6% are more severe with intensive care.
The mortality rate for COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital is 4%.
In these studies, we assessed the composite case patterns of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to Hubei Province of China.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with cases in Italy from 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On 11th March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
The March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al., reported the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by WHO.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) had reported cases of COVID-19, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths as of 31 December 2019, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Get the combined number of COVID-19 cases and combined incidents
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) keeps records of COVID-19 cases from every country around the world, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 am using official sources such as countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and compare them to cases in Italy.
As a sample of the extent of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated 14 days of cumulative cases of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the aggregate number of reported cases in each country at 8:00 am on 15th March 2020 and compared them with the cases in Italy from 31st January to 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 status in EU/EEA countries and UK
The overall pattern of 14-day split cumulative cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK is similar to that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Throughout the EU/EEA and UK, the combined cases of COVID-19 started to rise around 21 February and then started to rise rapidly by 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This included the rapidly increasing number of reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK, where there was a similar pattern of increasing combined cases of COVID-19 (Supplementary Material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to cases in Italy from 31 January-15 March 2020.
It highlights that 15 other EU/EEA countries and UK had already reported as many cases as Italy 3 weeks earlier or less than 8am on 15 March.
Our results show that COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
The observed patterns in the combined cases of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is growing at a relatively fast pace across all countries.


Data on hospitalization and/or ICU admissions of COVID-19 patients is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).

A study conducted in 2010-11 revealed that there is a large disparity in the number of ICU and Medium Medical beds in Europe, which is 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany versus 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have less or more resources than Italy (in 2010-11 12.5 ICU and Medium Medical beds per 100,000 population).
The prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases in each EU/EEA country and UK is associated with a > 90% risk of ICU bed capacity exceeding the sample situation associated with healthcare capacity saturation, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are still limited to specific regions of EU/EEA countries and UK and hospitals and ICUs are providing treatment to a specific regional population, case data and ICU data should preferably be made available within the definition of regional centres for Figure 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience of Italy and the current pattern in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.

As the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment shows, a fast, proactive and inclusive approach to mitigation is needed, rather than delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the expected rapid increase in such cases will not allow decision makers and hospitals to assess, adopt and adapt their responses if not implemented early.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.

If this fails, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients who will require ICU in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Disease (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world and has been a catastrophe for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2, which caused SARS to infect thousands of people in 2003, may have been transmitted by bats and may have shown similar symptoms by similar mechanisms.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmissible and is affecting older people than young people and men more than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the developing research topic.
We have covered the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, so on 11 February 2020 the WHO renamed it SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COV Disease 19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2nd March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "public enemy number one" and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, over 200 research papers have been published on COVID-19 covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7th January 2020, which has established the viral sequence in addition to various cases.
This review seeks to summarize research progress in new and slowly evolving subjects.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-borne diseases, such as Middle East respiratory disease (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prognosis and some remaining urgent questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, primarily causing approximately 15% of common cold cases.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported by the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV order was issued.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️



On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak as a global health emergency.


The multi-central study of 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11 February 2020 has presented the updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but is primarily targeted in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of those infected were 50 years old, the lowest were under 20 years old and only 14 infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more males (0.27/1,00,000) than females (0.31/1,00,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly in Hubei and surrounding urban communities.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from infection to diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from infection to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Patient mortality rate with definite cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the patient mortality rate with adjustment was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (>60), and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and overlapping subfamily of viruses that includes a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta CoVs are known to affect humans.
This overlapping spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then skin fusion occurs.
The infectious RNA genome is released into the cell membrane; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNAs form virion-containing vesicles with overlapping glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new variant of Beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequential samples taken from the outbreak's original centre, the Huanan Seafood Market in Huan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
ACE2 in humans has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV's S protein, which in turn causes less severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new mini proteins, encoded by orf3b and the enzyme protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and inhibit expression of IFNß; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or target.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. indicated that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å was mixed with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the structures of the mixture that were open and closed were combined as dimers and that the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for the detection and transmission of CoVs.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and intermediate hosts
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated in bats and were transmitted to humans from feeding cats and camels respectively.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
However, it is unknown which medium carriers helped the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans and the route of transmission is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., have suggested that snakes should be carriers for the passage from bats to humans, with homosexual recombination occurring during S protein.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and in temperatures of 20°C and 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot survive in ultraviolet rays and at temperatures of 56°C after 30 minutes, with ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and other copper solvents besides chlorhexidine being able to effectively neutralize it.
Sars-CoV-2 is not generally resistant to the entire human race and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.


In general, when a virus attacks a host, it is first identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).

SARS-CoV's N protein, however, may help the virus escape the immune response.
Soon, the favorable immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells induce B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells produce cytokines, which are the providers that help the rescue cells.
However, COVs can inhibit T cell function by involving T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes elements and antibodies like C3A and C5A, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies taken from recovered patients have been shown to kill MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system produces large numbers of locally free cells which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst cases, damage to various organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the group is more likely to occur in elderly people and pregnant women with possible comorbidities.

SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated median incubation period of 1-14 days, with most cases lasting 3-7 days, such as the first 425 cases detected in Wuhan.
,,,,...............................................................................................................................
As described above, a very recent study shows that in a population of 8,866 cases the heating period was 4.8 (3.0 - 7.2) days.
It is important for healthcare officials to coordinate effective isolation periods based on the most accurate healing duration, which will prevent infected but asymptomatic people from spreading the virus to others.
As a general measure, individuals who have been in contact with or infected with the virus should be kept in isolation for a maximum of 14 days.
Do you need to quarantine for 24 days?
Fever is the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by asymptomatic or other symptoms such as dry cough, wheezing, muscle spasms, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within a week of becoming ill.
In severe cases, patients immediately develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were as follows: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55% and diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients required ventilation assistance.
Similar findings were made in two recent studies, one on a family group and one on a group of people who were infected by an asymptomatic person.

However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which was much higher than in COVID-19 cases and MERS was more deadly than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and gout (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been observed that fever (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and about 14-20% of patients needed ventilation support.

comparatively, by November 2002, the SARS mortality rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study from June 2012.
Previous study indicated that SARS-CoV-2 had a RO of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 - 7.23, whereas SARS-CoV had a RO of between 2 and 4.
SARS-CoV-2 is compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and RO in Table 1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less deadly of the two.



However, it has been suggested that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients who have been discharged from hospital may carry the virus again, leading to the caution to extend the period of isolation.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreasing numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L including < 1×109/L lymphocyte count and elevated aminotransferase levels and viremia.
The liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels had increased in the blood of some patients and the C-reactive protein and erythrocytes levels had increased in the blood of most patients.
In severe cases, the blood fibrin degradation production had increased levels of D-dimer and lymphocyte counts had decreased rapidly.
The majority of COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in chest radiography and were characterized by bilateral patch shadows in the lungs or ground glass opacity.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive darkening affect air exchange with increased intensity.
Type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes are damaged, causing a decrease in surface level and increased surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to circulate and increases the risk of lung damage.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first diagnostic evaluation of COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 showed that desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of antifungal membrane and penetration of central lymphocytes and multi-nucleated synesial cells in the lungs of patients who died of disease is consistent with the diagnosis of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate accelerating the epidemic, medical manifestations (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) began to be used for diagnosis in China on February 13, 2020.
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.


It is hoped that if validated in clinical samples, the new technique can dramatically enhance sensitivity and convenience.



Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly developing antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs initially and possibly other ACE2 expressing organs such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys to some extent.
Respiratory failure and malfunction is a major risk to patients and is a major cause of death.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an enhanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used for fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It is known that in SARS and MERS patients, an excess response of the immune system results in a cytokine storm.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release large numbers of free radicals which is a major cause of ARDS and various organ dysfunctions.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies corticosteroids and tosilizumab are used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune response, inhibition of IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF, inhibition of JAK, blintumomab, suppressor of cytokine signaling 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, in SARS and COVID-19 patients, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury.

However, short-term treatment of low to moderate dose corticosteroids is recommended for the thoughtful use of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of this writing, there is no confirmed effective antiviral treatment.
However, in a US patient with COVID-19, remdesivir was given intravenously and it was found to be effective.
Remdesivir, a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead to treat diseases originally caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Remdesivir later showed potential blocking for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.

Combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may result in diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibodies from cured patients

It's true that cured patients have a higher number of antibodies in their blood than the pathogens.
Immunoglobulins (IGs) are antibodies produced by B lymphocytes that recognize and directly destroy specific molecules in the pathogen.
On this basis, cells were collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and 10 critically ill patients were injected.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
However, verification and clarification for widespread use are needed until specific treatments are developed.
Also, some of the cellular damage that is associated with therapeutic effects must be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and can lead to cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially lethally toxic in its form.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells to treat a seriously ill patient is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly to fight a global pandemic.
It is therefore important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to test effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies faster.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
TCM theory, however, states that the effectiveness of TCM depends on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most effective elements are unknown or uncertain because such elements or their highest combinations are difficult to extract and verify.

For example, Shu Feng Ji Du capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.

On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the time taken to regain body temperature, resolve symptoms and be admitted to hospital was much shorter in the WM+ TCM group than in the WM+ group alone.
Most importantly, the rate of symptomatic increase (mild to severe) was much lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was also much lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, for the effectiveness and safety of TCM, large scale controlled testing is needed in more centres.
It would be somewhat bizarre to characterize the mechanism of action and explain the components of TCM treatments or if possible their combination.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 often experience severe infectious or life-threatening illness, and people in isolation also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Infection symptoms such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as treatment side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause anxiety and depression.

Mental support includes the setting up of multidimensional mental health groups, regular and transparent dialogue on accurate news and treatment plans regarding the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, use of professional power tools and use of social distancing apps.

S Protein-based vaccine is being developed to generate long term and qualitative antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, physical performance and lethal challenge patterns in adult subjects and protective factors against animal-transmitted viral infections have not been detected in the vaccine candidates prior to the start of clinical trials.
This may be because the impact of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.

Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the obstacle is challenging as it requires a long time (average 18 months) to develop a vaccine and dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has started to show its full therapeutic sequence in thousands of patients right now.
In most cases, the patient can recover gradually without any recurrence.
like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.

Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be associated with or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
As described above, in the study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of the patients who had COVID-19 were aged over 50 years and were aged between 30-65.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying disorders and complications and were significantly older than those without (median age of 51, versus 66), suggesting age as a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are likely to suffer from serious cardiovascular and cardiovascular problems.
Heart disease was also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to bind to ACE-2 positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that the relationship between age and current illness is important and can influence each other.
Abnormal lab findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are a potential long-term diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment and ultimate recovery.
The correlation between the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 and CRP levels has also been suggested.

These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver and are released in tissue damage.
,,,.................................................................................................................................
Key Medical Symptoms: Chest radiography and transient increase in medical symptoms should be considered together with other issues in making conclusions and estimating the complexity of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used as adjunctive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.

Steroids should be used in low doses and for short duration in COVID-19 patients if needed.
Stress: As described above, many patients suffered from extra stress during the COVID-19 outbreak as they had to live in isolation and very precarious conditions for long periods and witness the deaths of family members and loved ones.

According to demographic studies so far, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can recur efficiently in the upper respiratory tract rather than the lower respiratory tract and may cause mild or no symptoms at the initial stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause colds.
As such, early-stage or retention-period infected patients can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the pandemic.
SARS-CoV infection is thought to spread when patients are critically ill, whereas most infections do not occur in the early stages.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is therefore more severe than the SARS outbreak and is difficult to control.
China is currently making a massive effort including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of nearly the entire population, to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.

Paul Hunter, has predicted that COVID-19 which is more infectious than SARS will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the mid-turbine and throat swab of a patient who was discharged from hospital 2 weeks after recovering from illness, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be in a flu-like cyclical sequence.

The initial estimate was that Ebola could lead to 1 million cases and 5 million deaths.
However, due to strict isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.

The COVID-19 pandemic is compared to the SARS and MERS pandemics below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus has also been found in feces, which has raised the possibility of infection from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases may have been hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients having other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.

The first step in reducing the risk of infection is to wear face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series #1860s) help in preventing the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected individuals from reaching the surface of the material through the air, so that they do not infect others.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As particles can penetrate through five surgical masks one on one, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series #1860) without surgical masks.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Virus can also infect people through their eyes.


The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to self-isolate, and to limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
The minimum distance that people should be able to stay away from patients is considered to be three feet.
These measures have been proven to be effective in reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.

This message greatly reduced the sense of caution in the public, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time to keep the disease to a minimum in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control authorities can learn from this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.

The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new virus, SARS-CoV-2, which started in late December 2019.

COVID-19 affects older men more than younger men and older men more than women, and has higher severity and mortality rates among older men than younger men.
SARS has a higher death rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus without symptoms, whereas SARS patients can only do so when they are seriously ill, making it much harder to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have negative results from routine RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered from the virus can become positive again.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of the virus spreading.

The outbreaks of acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown just how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The coronavirus resurfaced with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 and we were surprised by its high transmissibility, but its pathogenicity was lower than that of its cousin SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal disease and therefore it is beneficial for us to understand the origin of the animal disease of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are nonpathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to be mediated by parasitic fungi.
Identifying animal pathogens can have a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
The investigation of animal-to-animal interactions may shed light on important information on the human COVID pathogen.
In this review, we are presenting a review of the existing information on seven HCoVs, with a focus on their discovery history as well as their animal origin and inter-membrane transmission.
Importantly, we compare different HCOVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of unspliced, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The largest genome of these RNA viruses, 26 to 32 kilobases, is called "COV" because it looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
STRUCTURALLY, COVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, which are designated as NSP1-16
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
COVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV) according to the different protein sequences, of which the beta-CoV generation contains the most HCoVs and is divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Fylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice serve as the genetic source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, whereas birds are the primary hosts for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
COVs have been crossing the species barrier for thousands of years and some have emerged as important human pathogens.

Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, which are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly associated with mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively high proportion of patients who are at increased risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
In 1960, the first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of common cold patients.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on self-limiting symptoms generating HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.

The SARS outbreak of 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in modern history, infecting over 8,000 people with an estimated 10% of the raw case fatalities.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuous epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread rapidly to the rest of the world.
The novel HCoV of 2019 (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), which as of 3 March 2020 has caused over 3,120 deaths and over 91,000 infections.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven ACOVs are of animal origin in bats, mice or pets.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the origins of the animal disease of ACOV reveals the natural history, driving forces and constraints behind the species leap.
It will also guide or facilitate the detection of the host, mediator and promoter parasite (V) Poshinda of SARS-CoV-2, thus playing a key role in stopping its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenicity of HCoV.
We emphasize the following general themes and discuss that the HCoV parent virus is normally pathogenic in its natural parasitic host but becomes pathogenic when it is interspecies in a new host.
We also looked at the art of HCoV evolution where if infectivity increases, pathogenicity decreases.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
The animal COV has been known since the late 1930s.

In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the findings of HCoVs in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and subsequently produced WI-38 lung cell lines.
HCoV-229E has been shown to cause cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, wheezing and sore throat, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from a small mouse organ culture and then from a serial passage in the brain.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, which is not distinguishable in terms of symptoms from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally widespread and are transmitted primarily during the winter season in low temperature environments.
Typically, these two viruses have a recovery time of less than a week and then about two weeks of illness.
According to studies on human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have developed mild colds.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first properly documented universally transmissible HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
SARS was first detected in the Guangdong Province of China in late 2002.
SARS outbreak resulted in 774 deaths with 8,096 reported cases spread across several countries and continents.

SARS-CoV infection can lead to muscle aches, headaches, fever, tingling and chills, followed by shortness of breath, cough and then shortness of breath.
Answers to SARS lab tests include: vascular degeneration, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase.
Diffuse alveolar damage, growth of lining cells and increase in macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation after that.

The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who had arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, there has been a tremendous effort to research HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be more prevalent in children, the elderly, and patients with immunocompromised respiratory disease.
HCoV-NL63 is commonly associated with colds, cataracts, fever, and respiratory infections.
Another study in the Netherlands also isolated the same virus from the nasal secretions of an eight-month-old baby with pneumonia.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of all respiratory illnesses and its incidence is highest during the summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with inhibition colitis, also known as croup.

HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma progression, including community-acquired pneumonia and respiratory infections.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found worldwide causing mild respiratory illness.

Typically, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and persist in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed severe pneumonia and kidney failure.

The second outbreak was in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.

Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS suffered from severe renal failure, which is very uncommon for MERS in HCoV infections.
The number of patients with digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting was over 30%.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and has designated the disease as COVID-19.

Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, compared to 1.2%, outside China.
SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, cough and pneumonia.
Some patients also developed hypoglycemia.
Pneumonia was one of the most serious symptoms and could rapidly escalate to severe respiratory distress.

SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic, but more infectious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have uncommon cases and may have contributed to its rapid spread worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 is compared with six other HCoVs and shows a large number of similarities and differences.
First, the duration of the incubation and the duration of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community-derived HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is showing features that are common during HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, even though the rates are low, SARS-CoV infections also show a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases.
Third, infection of SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting patterns of both HCoV and SARS-CoV in the community.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs transmitted through the community.
On the other hand, just as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases reduce the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 upon transmission to humans, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies will see whether SARS-CoV-2 oral infection plays the same role as SARS-CoV in at least some cases.
It will be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal, as are community-acquired HCoVs.
Though, once transmitted to humans, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained transmission to humans, will be influential in the eventual fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs from all four mild symptom communities have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCOVs.
In other words, they both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
️Human pathogenic HCoVs and human-caused serious HCoVs should be eliminated.
To achieve this, HCoVs must be allowed to replicate in humans to a degree sufficient to accumulate favorable mutations that would defeat the pathogen's inhibitory factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to become fully adapted to humans.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
THE COVs are four community-acquired viruses that have been spreading to humans for years, causing colds in immunocompromised individuals.
These viruses don't need animal shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans properly and their transmission from humans is not likely to be sustainable.
They should be maintained and propagated in their animal habitat and spread to susceptible human targets, preferably through one or more intermediate and amplifier hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are common to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least for now, it's as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoVs.

They will be fully compatible with humans without shelter or intermediate animals and will continue to see if they spread to humans.

An animal can be a host for HCoV evolution if it has hosted a closely related ancestor that shares high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
In these strains, the ancestral virus is usually adapted and not pathogenic.
Similarly, parasite scavengers provide HCoV with a permanent and long term shelter.
In both cases, the pathogen is naturally infected and is the natural carrier of the HCoV or its parent virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
These mediator viruses can then act as animal viruses of human transmission and act as propagator viruses by providing the virus with a momentary opportunity to replicate and then transmit to humans to increase the extent of human transmission.
A HCoV infection can be terminated if it cannot sustain its transmission in the mediator tissue.
In contrast, HCoVs can accept mediated nutrients and not only do so, but can also establish long-term pathogenicity.
In this case, the intermediate parasite becomes the natural parasite.
Epidemiological data have predictably revealed that the first SARS case has a history of contact with predators.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IGG was higher in animal trade than in the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larva) and raccoon dogs were first identified in live animal markets as carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses which were similar to SARS-CoV.

However, it was also reported that masked palm civets from non-living market contact in the wild or farms were mostly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be mediating enhancer hosts but not natural harbours of SARS-CoV.

All these are seen as the final vestiges of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research for natural animal host SARS-CoV identified a closely related bat bat COVID, called SARS-related Rhinolopus bat COVID HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshoe bat.
The bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
This and other bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the groundwork for the new idea that bats feed on evolving human pathogens.

The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from bat semen samples which were shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, the blood plasma of a recovered SARS patient was able to neutralize the WIV1.
WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.

The genealogical analysis groups MERS-CoVs into the same cluster as does the bat-CoVs HKU4 and HKU5.
Brawfish COV-HKU4 and MERS-COV Poshinda Grahi, use dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for viral penetration.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymers of MERS-CoVs is genealogically close to those found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.

MERS-CoV and its closely related bat-CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the immediate parasitic hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV specific immunoglobulin antibodies, such as the Middle Eastern-derived camels found in several African countries.
Live MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further suggesting that camels act as parasitic nutrients for MERS-CoVs.
It is noteworthy that a large number of viruses with generally mild symptoms have been experimentally identified as having taken refuge in MERS-CoV infected camels.
Significantly, infected camels not only transmit the virus through the respiratory tract but also through the urinary tract, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus from the larvae.

SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat COVID RATG13 isolated from Rhinolephs related bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG-13 is very good for determining parentage.
This means that bats are unlikely to be immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless a similar bat-CoV is detected in the future.
SARS-CoV-2 was likely mediated by a poaching animal from a wildlife species sold and killed at the Hunan Seafood Wholesale Market, with several of the earliest COVID-19-related cases associated, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
These new pangolins share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They group SARS-CoV-2-like viruses into two sub-branches in the genealogical tree, one of which shares a more similar grey binding domain (RBD), a 97.4% amino acid sequence identifier, with SARS-CoV-2.
In a paradoxical truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more distinct, yet have a higher rate of genome-wide homology sequences.
Recent research on diseased pangolins has also reported detection of viral coating on lung samples, which was found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a different assembly method and physical curation to generate a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full length virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that one of the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 is pangolins.
However, due to the different sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as direct pangolins.
Further, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much smaller than the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway to SARS-CoV-2 evolution in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins have the highest sequence homology in RBDs, with SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 sharing the highest genome-wide sequence homology.

Panegolins
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still looking for immediate animal origins of SARS-CoV-2.

Genetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bat-borne COVs, whereas the parent virus of HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 has been found in rodents.
It has been reported that the bat COVID-2 (Appalachian Ridge COVID-2) detected in the North American Triangular Bat has shown close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is chromosomally related to another bat-CoV, named Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, at the same time camels were suspected as its mediator.
For clarity, Figures 1 and Table 2 provide a summary of current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs.
History has presented evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs through genealogical analysis.
n 1890s, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from domestic animals to infect humans, a respiratory infection epidemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is poorly understood.
Bat alpha-CoV has been identified as closely related to HCoV-229E.
They have an alpha-CoV.

First, it is likely that humans, not alpacas, have come into contact with bats in a shared environment.
nsennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are distinct and non-pathogenic to alpha-CoV bats, whereas Alpacas alpha-CoV has been implicated in respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Alpacus alpha-CoV has not been found in the wild.

Tatsuyoku, batakushi ni tsukamute mo miteiru kotoba wa irareru, Ebola, nipah, henndra.
It's not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels can act as mediators that can transmit the virus to humans, as happened in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich stock of viral species for the interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and transmissions between species.
Longevity, dense colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly all make bats ideal as 'virus carriers'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been penetrating dromedary camels for decades.

MERS-CoV is a mild pathogen and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The fact that they infect a small number of humans is an accident, and humans are terminal survivors of MERS-CoV because their infection is not permanent.
The camel's role in MERS-CoV transmission is in contrast to the role of pangolins, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 contraction.
In particular, pangolins beta-CoV is highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They may be a phase inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, as in the SARS-CoV cases outbreak.
Future research should consider or rule out the numerous possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
First, bats can be parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.

Second, pangolins, which may be one of the mediating enrichment molecules that have been recently identified for the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
The virus is transmitted to humans through slaughterhouses and through eating fish that have been hunted.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
First, they have a relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
When compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COVs is dependent on the stage of acceptance of the new pathogen, with an average replacement rate of "mild" to "high" with 10-4 replacements per year per 2 sites.
COVs have evidence-representing exoribonucleases, whose deletion results in high levels of mutation and degradation or even viability.
Remdesivir, the nucleotide analogue, is known to replicate COVs by inhibiting the synthesis of these exoribonucleases and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
Though, the mutation rate of COVs is about a million times higher than their offspring.
Also,when the COVs are not well tolerated by the mosquitoes, the mutation rate is always high.
SARS-CoV-2 has a distinctly low mutation rate, indicating a high level of acceptance in humans, compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
As an addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well accepted by dromedary camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will make the ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly vaccinated and condition-viral.
Second, the large RNA genomes in COVIDs allow for an additional degree of flexibility in genome modification for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood for interspecies co-evolution, which when conditions are right is beneficial for the emergence of novel COVIDs.
This is supported by a large number of other open readable frames and protein activities encoded at the 3' end of the genome.
Third, COVs randomly and frequently switch templates between RNA replicates through a "copy-selection" mechanism.
In the intestine, they act as mixing vessels, with string switching occurring frequently during transcription of the COV RNA.
A high level of homologous full length and subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to produce new COVID.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal COVs such as Batwhale SL-CoV and Batwhale COV-HKU9.
Virus-virus interaction in relation to infection is a very important factor in the transmission of infection.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which also shows evidence of positive selection between incidents of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis of human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV appears to have been rapidly adapted to different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of S protein.
In general, in RBD in S proteins, COV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selectively targeted by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are found in the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 region, which binds to human ACE2 as well as their receptors for viral penetration.
SARS-CoVs' RBD allows for the interspecies transmission of viruses that are able to identify ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, zebras, mice and raccoon dogs.
actually, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be distinct in the RBDs in the human and civet virus isolates, and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding pattern for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SVT SARS-CoV has K489N and S487T mutants in their RBDs, which can enhance the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids might be crucial in virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that their binding affinity for human ACE2 may have been altered.
,,,...........................................................................................................................................................
It will also be of interest to determine if any other co-contractors are needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63 is also likely to bind to ACE2, albeit with a different S-particle.
There are numerous other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful introduction of this COVID in humans following interspecies transmission from their animal nutrients.
As a cellular receptor, the effect of HCoVs on interspecies transmission is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and inhibitory factors.
The circulation of this nutrient protein between humans and the natural accumulators of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rats can impede the transmission of HCoVs between species.
HCoVs must be able to transmit successfully between species by strengthening nutrient dependence factors and reversing nutrient inhibitory factors.
In this context, molecular determinants in this important virus-nutrient interaction have yet to be identified and characterized.
The use of CRISPR's state-of-the-art technology for SARS-CoV-2 may be useful in unbiased screening of genome-wide and inhibitory factors of nutrient dependence.
New HCoVs: Going back to zero
The variation of bat COVs provides ample opportunity for emergence of new HCoVs.
CoVs of bats are thus used as a genetic repository for HCoVs.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically alter the viral makeup.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
SARS-CoV-29, which was isolated at the onset of the human coronavirus, is characterized by a 29-nucleotide deletion.
ORF8 is cleaved into ORF8a and ORAP8b and is considered to be a positive mutation, which promotes nutrient migration.
Also, SARS-CoV has a history of potential recombination with the lineage of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, which are characterized by a large number of small recombinant regions in RNA.
also identified in NSP 9, much in NSP 10, and parts of NSP 14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the disease MERS-CoV has experienced incidents of recombination in different lineages, which has been observed in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with COVs of other animals in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection may also contribute to unintended alteration of the viral genome, often leading to the release of the virus from the selective pressure exerted by the host immune system.
The loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain is an example of this effect, which causes two-nucleotide deletion.
Uniform ORF4 can be found in HCOC-229E-associated bat and camel viruses, Alpaca alpha-CoV indicates single nucleotide inclusion, which results in frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by selective pressure within their parasitic hosts.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It appears that bats have adapted to COVID both physically and anatomically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pre-inflammatory response in the pancreas reduce the effectiveness of the pathotherapy activated by COV.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Also, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the bats' high-metabolic activity both suppress the COV replication activity and result in proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus generating a viral lineage that provides selective pressure to become highly pathogenic when new nutrients are introduced.
The more pathogenic COV lineages also evolve in recombination, which is the precursor to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for nutrient uptake.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not appeared by accident in the last two decades.
COVs are known to cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic hosts, such as bats or camels.
These strong proteins replicate without destroying the immune response.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
On the contrary, in the host, the immune response is projected from replicating the COVID.
SARS-CoV-2 therapy may be a beneficial strategy to break the immune response.
The interferon response is particularly strong in the pancreas.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

SARS-CoV-2 follows a common pattern of occurrence, leading to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
In contrast, bat beta-CoVs shared 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoVs, whereas bat-CoVs shared 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.

The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins beta-CoV has been found to be surprising, suggesting that pangolins may have functioned as one of the mediating agents, or that pangolins beta-CoV may have contributed to the genetic fragmentation of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The question remains, however, that there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either deliberately or accidentally man-made.
The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has brought the covid-19 virus back into the limelight.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of our animal origins and the importance of the parasitic ancestor of HCoV in human infection.
Evidence from outbreaks showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and that transmission to humans was mediated by mosquitoes.
SARS-CoV was transmitted by contact between humans and wild cats in the market, closing the seafood market and killing wild cats there, effectively ending the SARS-CoV epidemic.
For the same reason, given the finding that the multiple lineage of pangolins beta-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal transmission.

On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.

They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
As was done in China's wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels should be taken with the integration of other infection control measures.
n't we can eliminate these viruses, new mutant variants can arise to cause an outbreak.

In particular, bat COVs are very diverse along with the animal potential.
The potential for evolution and recombination of these animal-derived COVs is unlimited, resulting in the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or life-threatening forms of COV in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, some areas in China should abandon the wildlife eating culture.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

They stay in their natural habitat until they get a chance to spread.

To better understand the life cycle of COVs and their natural hosts, there is a need for regular monitoring of mammals, which could be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and preventing future outbreaks.
To conclude, keeping humans away from the natural habitat of the animal virus is the most effective way to contain the animal virus.

First, if a bat infects the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to pangolins, it's interesting to see under what conditions the bat and pangolins share the same ecological space.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, we'll have to figure out how humans got in contact with bats.
Third, if third mammals really functioned as mediators, it should be clear how they interacted with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be monitored and experimentally infected with the possibility of being susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Continuing research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, and on important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In this letter, a comment is highlighted on our guidelines and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" as per the latest diagnosis and treatment provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which has been officially named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was renamed as Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed quick advice guidelines and published them online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.

Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice; so diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, a total of seven editions of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, were published with some reference changes.
Zhou et al. have now received comments to our guidelines, who have presented simple score propositions based on their clinical experience.

We applaud and thank him for his remarkable work.
However, its work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (trial 7th edition) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3rd March 2020), confirming a suspected case requires either one item of clinical history feature combined with two items of clinical discovery, or three items of clinical discovery if there is no clear clinical history.
History of contagion: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan City and its environs, or in the area where COVID-19 cases have been reported for 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) History of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (including positive nucleic acid test); (3) History of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City and its environs, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported for the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) History of contact with confirmed cases (such as in areas such as home, office, school, classroom, etc., with fever/shortness within 2 weeks and respiratory symptoms ≥ 2 weeks).
Clinical findings: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with a typical characteristic of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing a reduced total white cell count to normal, or a reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset phase.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with any one of the following components of pathogenic or serological evidence as further provided: (1) a positive real time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a complete genome sequence of the virus that enhances high affinity to the known novel coronavirus; (3) a positive serum test for SARS-CoV-2 for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies; or a positive change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or ≥4 times in the acute phase recovery period.
We can see that Real Time PCR testing for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenicity of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and later in the seventh edition, serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers, including the inclusion of a blood sample from respiratory tract samples, to search for optimal nucleic acid identification for this rapid diagnosis, who have increased the availability of different samples, and supported positive results of specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
Plus, there was a growing body of evidence that reminded us to be cautious with typical symptoms and allergic patients.
, Zhou et al. should update their flowchart, because they're classifying a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".

To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to the readers to provide their comments.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest in a single day
Bengladesh yesterday confirmed 5 new COVID-19 deaths in a single day
The highest number of deaths from this virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the reported infected cases are 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who are staying at home, as reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh.

According to Dr. Mirzade, two cases were in the 60s, two were in the 51 to 60s, and one was in the 41-50s.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.

Hospital officials told a local news outlet, Adolu Agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Friendship Hospital.

SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide

At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea, on Thursday, claimed to be one of the few countries to remain free from coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the WHO has confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
United States, has reported over 244,000 cases of coronavirus, with 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that coronavirus infection killed more than 1,000 in the US on Wednesday.
Worldwide, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.

Australia stores reduced their limit of toilet paper per transaction
Australia's Woolworths and Coles store chain reduced its ban on purchases of toilet paper nationwide to two and one package per transaction respectively.
ALDI, too, introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
The changes follow the previous four-pack per transaction ban introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 reveal, reported that the four-pack restriction would be, "many stores are selling out within an hour of delivery", and said that demand is "incredible", while ALDI, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Woolworths spokesperson said there was a "huge increase" in sales last week.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made early availability for the planned Wednesday.
The executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, Russell Zimmerman, said that the retailer tried to increase inventory, but it was hampered by the local council's restriction on truck-delivery time.
They expect production costs to rise, as suppliers have to meet demand, and with less specials.


He commented that toilet paper is a big item, which leads to a low stock in quantity, and, when sold, it empties a huge amount of shelf space.
Coles and Woolworths showed that if there are a lot of items on the shelf, like toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there are a lot of them, you're going to reduce the likelihood of panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said that its stock was running out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent, emphasized that they are working 24/7 to keep the supply smooth.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers in Melbourne were offering free toilet paper to the bidder who placed the first bid at its auction, when some auctions were held because buyers had time during the big Labor Day Weekend.
NT News Thursday's edition, printed daily in Darwin, had eight water-inserted cuts to be used as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, the store was originally opposed to the imposition of restrictions, stating that they had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said there is also a huge demand for other products including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.


️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We are deeply concerned about both the dangerous level of spread and the seriousness and the appalling level of inaction.
Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, described the global outbreak as "unprecedented".
"No other respiratory virus besides influenza has been traced from its emergence to its global spread", he said in comments published on CNN in February.
"We have never seen the global shock caused by the coronavirus before", says Gebreyesus.
" And we haven't seen a global wave that can be controlled in the same time".
The current global pandemic follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fosse, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, commented on the outbreak: "It's certain that the situation is going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 Coronavirus outbreak is the global outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak, which was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has been recognised as a global outbreak since 11 March 2020.


China has a mortality rate estimated at 4%, while the global mortality rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough, and diarrhea.
In complicated cases, symptoms may include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The time from infection to symptoms is usually about five days, but can be anywhere from two to 14 days.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Primary care is symptomatic and basic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the face when coughing, keeping distance from others, monitoring, and self-isolation of those who are suspected of being infected.

The global pandemic has led to severe socio-economic dislocation globally, sporting, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled, and widespread supply shortages have been exacerbated by fearful purchasing.
193 countries have schools and universities closed either nationally or locally, affecting nearly 99.4% of the global student population.


Health officials in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.

The virus that has caused this outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the coronavirus of bats, the coronavirus associated with cats, and SARS-CoV. The earliest known individual with symptoms was later found to be ill on December 1, 2019, and the individual was not directly related to the later meat market group.
The initial cluster of cases reported in 2019 was found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, traced as of 17 November 2019, may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that as new cases registered in China declined but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China surpassed the number in China for the first time.
The cases reported may have been substantially underreported, especially in cases where mild symptoms have been observed.

Cases refer to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and who have confirmed positive according to official guidelines.

According to a study released on 16th March, as of 23rd January, approximately 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were undetected and 79% of cases were transmitted by undocumented persons.

The baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
The study, published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of people who have COVID-19 recover.
And for those who don't, the time from onset to death is 6 to 41 days, and for most people, it's 14 days.


The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing, for example, at home, in sanitariums, etc.

"We know that [the number of deaths associated with the outbreak] is an underestimation", a statement confirmed by incomplete reports of decreased counts in the US. Such decreases are frequent in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China was reported in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside of Asia was reported in France on February 14.


The figures vary by region and time, and are influenced by the number of tests performed, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to cases is the total number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death/case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
China's death-to-case ratio fell from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case death rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
This data is not time-bound and it tracks a specific population from infection to resolution.

The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford has estimated that the global pandemic has a mortality rate of between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper-side estimate in this range is consistent with the first randomized testing of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study that analyzes the effect of testing on CFR.
WHO is confident that this global trend can be brought under control.
The maximum magnitude and maximum duration of this outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"If not detected, the outbreak stops growing at a certain level and decreases as the host population decreases", notes Maciej Boni of Penn State University.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that if all countries start following WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, "it will be over by June".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV2 is likely to spread for one to two years.
The study, led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, found that physical distancing and other measures "will be needed (likely 18 months or longer) until a vaccine is available".
William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, notes that "it is impossible to eradicate the virus completely because it is so easily transmitted", so "it will be a seasonal disease and will likely return every year".
The toxicity or severity of recurrence depends on the collective immunity and the extent of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms are relatively non-specific and are not likely to be present in infected individuals.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms; for example, difficulty breathing, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial or lip blue; and advises immediate medical attention for such symptoms.

The Chinese estimate that the proportion of people without symptoms may be as low as 44%.
The incubation period (from infection to onset of symptoms) is usually between one and 14 days, usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell was initially estimated at 30% and then dropped to 15%.

The disease is thought to be spread primarily by close contact and small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking, with close contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by tiny droplets that can linger in the air for a long time, such as droplets that come out of the mouth when you speak. Although the virus is not produced in the air, droplets in the respiratory tract can be produced when you breathe, when you speak.
These droplets can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or can be drawn into the lungs with breath.

The Chinese government has ruled out transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through faeces or oral route.


The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states that although it is not entirely clear how quickly the disease spreads, it can spread from one person to two or three others, surviving on surfaces for hours to days.
The virus can be found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for up to four hours.


Acute acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus, first isolated in Wuhan from three individuals with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases.
SARS-CoV-2 possesses all the characteristics of all the related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies as its protective shell is dissolved by household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is basically closely related to SARS CoV.
It is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genus Betacoronaviruses makes a genome with variants derived from two strains, including subgenus Serbicoronavirus (Lineage B).
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only a single amino acid difference between the genome sequences of the rhino viruses and the human viruses.
To date, 92% of the genome material shared by the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in whole genome comparisons, which is insufficient to prove that the coronavirus is the same mediator host.
Virus infection can be diagnosed early based on symptoms but confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected trials.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan has suggested that CT, although less accurate, is significantly more sensitive than PCR and that many of its imaging features are consistent with other pneumonia and disease processes.
The American College of Radiology has recommended in March 2020 that CT should not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or be used as a first test.
WHO has issued a series of guidelines for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
This test uses real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a breathing tube or blood sample.
Results are usually available within hours to days.

As of 6 April 2020, none of these tests have been proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Cellax in the US has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the imaging on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not show symptoms are unusual in peripheral ground glass opacity and no pleural fusion.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that imaging, while less accurate for detecting infection, is faster and more sensitive, and suggested that it should be considered as a screening tool in areas where the disease is prevalent.
Convoluted neural networks with AI-based radiographs and CTs have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Those who are already infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.


This means that the virus has spread in the community and some members of the community do not know when and where they became infected.
The use of location data by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement to limit such surveillance.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

To prevent the spread of disease, hand washing is recommended.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or if hands are dirty, before eating and after nosing, coughing or sneezing.
The reason is that outside the human body, the virus dies with household soap, because household soap breaks its protective sheath.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
WHO recommends not touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine can eliminate surface contamination (the surface of stainless steel can be sterilized using only one minute of disinfectant.)
Other solvents such as benzalkonium and crohexidine are less effective.
CDC has recommended that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place such as a nursery or nursery, then all devices such as tablets, touch screens, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick persons in such areas should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with a folded noose or tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and distance travelled by breathing droplets that are spread when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if they do not have proper hand hygiene.
WHO has recommended that healthy people only wear masks if they are at risk, for example those who are caring for people infected with COVID-19, they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started to encourage the masks to be worn by the general public.
CDC recommends the use of non-medical masks made of cloth in the US. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for public health care providers, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without masks or without covering their nose and face.
On 16th March, Vietnam has urged everyone to wear face masks when going out in public places, to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when entering grocery stores.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan has been manufacturing 10 million masks daily since mid-March and from 1 April passengers will be required to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses.
Panama has made wearing a face mask mandatory when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford to buy face masks make them at home.
Facial masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.



Many governments have mandated or recommended social distancing in areas where the outbreak has occurred.
US Government agencies and the Department of Health reduced the maximum number of people to gather from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 is not known in the region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.

The most stringent self-isolation guidelines have been issued for those in the high-risk groups.


Prevention is done at the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track those who have been infected, isolate them, as well as plan infection control measures and vaccinate to prevent spread of disease to other populations.
When the spread of disease cannot be prevented, steps are taken towards mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and to reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Preventing and mitigating the spread can be combined.
To prevent spread, more tactile measures are needed, such as reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1 by reversing the global pandemic.
Thus, they reduce the risk of stress on healthcare and give time to develop vaccines and treatments.

Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and local quarantine and warned to be vigilant about the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial assistance to those who have self-quarantined and has imposed penalties on those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and penalized stockpiling of medical supplies. Following the example of Great Britain and the United Nations, there are major challenges in mitigating (slowing down, not stopping) and preventing (reversing) the spread of the epidemic.


Longer intervention to contain or contain the spread of a pandemic causes economic and social damage.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop them which involves testing of available drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting may help to reduce symptoms.
The need for oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid, and respiratory assistance may seem acute.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
A number of compounds that have been previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
WHO has identified capacity building and optimizing healthcare for COVID-19 patients as fundamental measures to respond to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO European Branch have issued guidelines to take available resources for hospitals and primary healthcare to various levels including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, eliminating alternative methods where possible, isolating COVID-19 positive patients and increasing sensitivity capacity by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.

Lab testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses involves methods that detect the presence of the virus and the presence of antibiotics produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is unique and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to detect a very recent or active infection.
Testing of antibiotics can be used for both serology diagnosis and close monitoring of the population.
Tests for antibiotics show how many people had the disease, including people with very minor symptoms to name or people without symptoms.
The results of this test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate and immunity level of a population.


This variability is also likely to have a significant impact on the case for reported mortality, which is likely to be highly unrealistic in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be used to test respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing for throat sputum is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can be removed from the throat and continue to multiply rapidly in the lungs.

The test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. BGI Group was one of the first few companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit in China. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is delivering the 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-NCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel through the International Regent Resource.
One in three genetic test defects in older versions of test sets resulted in inconclusive results and hampered trials at CDC in Atlanta; resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.

The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. US commercial laboratories began trials in early March 2020.
On 5th March, 2020, Labs Corp. announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country.
No limits were announced on quantity; sample collection and processing should be done only in accordance with CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and manufactured by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology in Russia.

On 19th March 2020, FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's M2000 system; FDA had earlier granted such authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Safied similarly received EUA from FDA for testing in approximately 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can give a definite result in as little as 5 minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.

The March 2020 information review concluded that "X-rays of the chest are less useful for early diagnosis, whereas CT [computed tomography] findings may appear before symptoms begin".
The typical features of CT include a bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification with a substrate asymmetric lateral distribution.
As the disease progresses, subplural domains, crazy paving and aggregation develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan at the current outbreak site has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific as it incorporates many of its imaging features into other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a test to be done prior to testing or diagnosing COVID-19". The CDC recommends PCR for early screening by March 2020.
Antibiotics are produced, including IgM and IgG, as part of the immune response to infection.
The tests can be used to detect infection, determine immunity and monitor the population, either at a central laboratory (CLT) or through Point of Care Testing (PoCT), approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms.
Most clinical laboratories will be able to test these with large scale automated systems that are designed to perform certain processes in a specific time period, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.

POCTs are usually performed by skin puncture to obtain a single blood sample.
Unlike PCR methods, pre-test extraction is not required.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA has only approved one trial under its Emergency Use Authorization.
The test is so powerful that hundreds of samples can be tested in a matter of hours and therefore this test is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.

Hong Kong has a plan whereby suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they spit it in, send it back and in a matter of time they get the test results. The British NHS has announced that they are conducting preliminary studies of a scheme to test suspected individuals at home, whereby they do not risk infecting others if they come to hospital or need to disinfect an ambulance. In a COVID-19 drive-through test for suspected individuals, their healthcare specialist takes the sample with the appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea deliver the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country. In Germany, on 2nd March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians stated that they had a capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day in the mobile system, and had tested 10,700 people in the previous week.
When asked by a doctor to do a test, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to test a total of 160,000 tests per week.


The first survey in the lab found that a total of at least 4,83,295 samples were tested and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 as of this week of the calendar 12/2020 and including week 12/2020. Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and used a method to test 64 patients at a time, in which all samples were collected and only further testing was performed if the sample was found to be positive. On February 5, 2020, the company opened a 2,000-square-meter lab in Wuhan, named "Huo-han" (Chinese: or English "Interim"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Construction was completed in 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and this modeling has shown that had this testing capacity not been started on time, Hubei would have seen 47% more cases and the associated cost of quarantine handling would have doubled.
Wuhan has been followed closely by Hua Yan Labs in a total of 12 cities in China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.


This prompted some authors to experiment with a sample preparation protocol that involves heating samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.
This was in conjunction with the purchase of drive through capabilities and wholesale throughput laboratories from Group 42 and BGI on a population basis (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).

China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States have developed various testing activities targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile.
The WHO adopted the German initiative to send manufacturing kits to low-income countries that do not have the resources to manufacture their own kits.
The German action was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed available testing in the US.

The large testing capacity of private sector laboratories was built up by the South Korean administration over a period of several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization ordered an increase in testing as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The company explained that the incorrect results may have been due to failure to collect samples or use the sets properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would return the kits with the wrong results and replace them with separate test kits supplied by Shenzhen Bioeci. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test kits purchased from China with the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 lakh test kits from China which were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that the kits be disposed of on the Danube. Turkish Health Ministry Ates Kara said that the kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "large error rate" and that they "were not used". The UK purchased 35 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
Testing, followed by isolation of patients who tested positive and tracking of people who came into contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive, has yielded good results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vovo, where the first COVID-19 deaths occurred, conducted two rounds of testing on an estimated 3,400 people, with an interval of approximately 10 days.
Temperature is low, and the average person who tested positive had no symptoms.

Statistics show that countries that test more than the death rate have a much lower death rate, probably because they can only detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first 10 negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 laboratories referenced by WHO for confirmatory testing.
out of the 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
The "% of tests positive" in the table below is influenced by the country's testing policy.

The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacterial, viral or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and harmful or disease-causing chemicals.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important habit for the general public.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
And home births are also about reducing infant mortality.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing practices could lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five years old.

This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by approximately one third and can be compared to providing clean water to low income segments.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence may be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap, which is routinely practiced in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs).
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is a major cause of death in children under five years of age, causing an estimated 18 million deaths per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause an estimated 35 million child deaths each year.
UNICEF says that by adopting the built-in habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet, more lives can be saved than with any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The small harmful effect of hand washing is that constant hand washing can dry out the skin and damage the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that too much hand washing can cause skin conditions such as itching, discoloration of the hands, known as hand ulcers, which are common among healthcare workers.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There are five key times of the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap to reduce the spread of infection by touching your hands to your mouth: after going to the bathroom (shorts, diarrhea), after cleaning your baby's lap (changing lap), before breastfeeding your baby, before eating and cooking food, or before/after handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be followed to prevent the spread of disease include before and after treating cut or other wounds; after sneezing, coughing or rinsing the nose; after touching animal feces or after handling animals and rubbish.

2015 study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing at 95%, the United States at around 77%, and China at the lowest rate at 23%. Some behavioral change practices are now showing signs of increasing hand washing at critical times. In developing countries, timely hand washing for schoolchildren is an alternative to promoting hand washing in children's behaviors.
The Philippines Department of Education implemented the "Mandatory Health Care Program" as an example of action measurement for the advancement of children's health and education.

Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that warm water is not effective in reducing the microbe load on hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-free hand sanitizer.

Most of them are in the form of gels with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulation, or in the form of a moist liquid such as glycerin, or in the form of foam to reduce the drying effect of alcohol and easy to use.

Alcohol rub kills sanitizer bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some pathogens (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccina, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi
Alcohol Rub Sanitizer is 70% alcohol and kills 99.97% (a 3.5 log reduction which is equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and 99.99% to 99.99% (a 4 to 5 log reduction) of germs on hands within 30 seconds of application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against germs like norovirus (or norvac), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Use plenty of hand antiseptic or alcohol rub to thoroughly clean both hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the area between all fingers until liquid, foam or gel sand for about 30 seconds.

The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin softeners to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients have been shown to reduce skin inflammation and dryness compared to soap or antibiotic detergents.
Allergenic contact dermatitis, contact biliary syndrome, or alcohol hypersensitivity, or substances in hand rubs are rarely found.


This is why hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens because pathogens stay on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and formulation and has historically outperformed alcohol and alcohol rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown sustained and accumulated antibiotic activity, unlike alcohol, where after repeated use the efficacy was shown to decrease, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low income groups cannot afford soap and they use ashes and dirt.
Ash and clay may be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it will increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, soil is a germicide because when soil comes in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
The US Centers for Disease Control recommends the following steps for hand washing to prevent the spread of the disease:
Wet hands with warm or lukewarm running water.
It is recommended to use running water because standing basins can be contaminated, and the water temperature doesn't seem to make much difference.
Pick up the foam by applying lots of soap, rubbing it on your hands, putting it on the back of your hands, between your fingers, under your nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use water to wash their hands.
Wip your hands for at least 20 seconds.

Tip tap is a simple technique where a can is hung with a rope and a lever is moved by the foot to pour a little water on the hand and soap.
Efficient hand drying is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public washrooms.

2008: A study by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, paper industry, compares the level of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194% and the number on the pools increased by 254%.
After drying with jet air, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42% and the number on the bottom increased by 15%.

After drying, use a paper towel to close the water (and open the exit door if needed)
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again.

The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing has reached unacceptable levels in many medical settings, where large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study found that proper handwashing and other simple practices can reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure containing best practices for handwashing and hand-washing in healthcare.

The promotion and reward of handwashing with soap can influence policy decision making, create awareness of the benefits of handwashing and change long-term behaviour of the population.
To implement this effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing rates in LMICs, whereas social marketing initiatives are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which, among other hygiene requirements, encourages schools to take simple, affordable solutions to ensure that students wash their hands with soap.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three stars.

For people in particularly vulnerable situations - such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - the importance of hand washing for human health was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers in the field of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelus, working in Vienna, Austria, and "English founder of modern nursing", Florence Nightingale.

In the 1980s, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively promoted hand washing as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, murals showing "proper hand washing techniques" were placed next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
"Washing one's hands with something" is a phrase that means someone is reluctant to take responsibility for something or share the intricacies of it.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but in some English communities the phrase came with a wider use.

It has also been found that when immoral acts are recalled or reflected upon, people wash their hands more often than others and tend to attach more importance to the hand washing device.


In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands after going to the toilet is mandatory.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands is mandatory before and after every meal.

COVID-19 Workplace Hazard Management is the application of occupational safety and health practices to the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk workplaces have minimal occupational contact with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular workplace cleaning and disinfection.
Moderate risk work includes work that requires superficial or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who may have been infected by ongoing community infections or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail outlets.

OSHO considers healthcare workers and morgue workers who have been in contact with a known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high risk of infection, including those who are carrying out aerosol-producing procedures or collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19, which increases the risk of exposure.

The COVID-19 outbreak can have many impacts on the workplace.


Finally, the flow of goods from geographical areas that are severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.
The risk-levels scheme addresses the various workplaces and occupations, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors, and risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline contingency plans for situations that may arise from outbreaks and the necessary controls to address those risks.
Prepare and respond to infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.

where business is, it affects the response to disease severity in the communities.

Where COVID-19 risks cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.

Administrative controls are changes to work policies or procedures that require action by the employer or employee.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All PPE should be selected based on the risks to the worker, fit for use (e.g. respirators) and be worn properly, be inspected, maintained and replaced as needed on a regular basis, and be removed, cleaned and stored properly or disposed of appropriately to prevent infection.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-risk workplaces have minimal workplace interactions with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended that all types of workplaces adopt basic infection prevention measures, including washing hands thoroughly and top-down, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, observing respiratory etiquette including covering the face when coughing and sneezing, making available tissue and paper waste disposal buckets, preparing for telecommunication or regular shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the workplace.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who show symptoms of severe respiratory illness should stay home for at least 24 hours without taking fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, as long as they do not have fever, fever symptoms, and other symptoms, and flexible sick leave policies are in place, which allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and employees are aware of those policies.
According to OSHA, moderate infection risk jobs include jobs where such people are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may be in close proximity to people within six feet (1.8 m) of the person who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business area or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a place where COVID-19 has been widespread.
This includes the installation of high-performance air filters in engineering controls for workers who have come into contact with the general public, such as schools, densely populated workplaces and some large retail centres, following the example of these places, and for more high-risk groups, including the installation of various training tools, including COVID-19 safety measures, the introduction of transparent plastic sneeze guards and physical barriers, and the installation of a drive-through window for customer service and environment. Providing temporary controls for risk groups and those at higher risk groups, providing virtual tools instead of face-to-face meetings, setting up various training schemes, providing up-to-date information to the public about COVID-19 safety issues and other safety measures, setting up a training platform for workers who may need to work in the workplace, providing training and education to the public about COVID-19 safety issues, and providing training to the public about the safety and other aspects of the work environment that may require them to work, including the introduction of a high-level training and communication tool, the introduction of a COVID-19 safety tool, and the development of a training platform for workers who may need to work in the workplace.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.

Ideally, medical follow-up is required in the quarantined person's room. CDC recommends that schools and child care facilities be temporarily closed for hygiene and disinfection, whether or not there is community transmission.
Where there is minimal to moderate community spread, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as postponing field trips, crowds and other large gatherings including physical education or prayer classes or dining in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, changing arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors and setting up separate wellness centres for children with flu-like symptoms.

Law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with other individuals who are infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.

OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high risk of infection.

Known or suspected COVID-19 patients are at high risk of infection if staff are carrying out aerosol-producing procedures or collecting or handling samples from such patients.
Aerosol-making procedures include intubation, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopes, some dental systems and examination or invasive sample collection.

Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and morgue structures.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients who are suspected of COVID-19 should be isolated in separate waiting rooms. Along with other PPE, OSHA recommends that respirators be allowed to be used by personnel working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients and aerosol-making process personnel.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators or better respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and make staff more comfortable. WHO does not recommend full body protection, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through other secretions of the body.
WHO recommends that only personnel performing screening at the entry points should wear surgical masks.
For personnel collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment without any aerosol-making procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face covers, gowns and gloves.

This month we find ourselves in a significant situation.
COVID-19 Global Warming is a case study that illustrates the interconnectedness of global humanity and our responsibilities towards each other.
We have no prior experience of this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation and team building that is at the heart of our organization.
The best proof that we are lucky to have the opportunity to work with such amazing people is the kindness and care that is seen in all of our colleagues through email, phone and chat.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to have you as my partner.
Last week, someone complimented me on their work.
He reminded me of how much meaning it has for the world to be able to read Wikipedia right now and how powerful a symbol it is to have this important resource online and available to everyone.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, much more than Ervi.
t is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it is going to have a meaningful impact on the world.
The importance of this campaign and your role in it will lead to some significant changes in the way we work together, starting next week.
"I'm not a good person, but I'm a good person".
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our vision and timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we thought about what would be the right response to what we are facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We want to take the stress off and help our mission for the long term.
You might want to dial back, but that's okay.
For all employees, contractors and contracted employees:
Our daily work schedule is expected to be approximately 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can be used in this campaign.

We don't track your time.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
You don't have to say it, but we do.
No need for sick leave or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team make adjustments to the calendar and schedule, so that the important parts of the job can be done.
(If you are diagnosed as COVID-19 positive, please tell Brian at T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and ensure that your situation is properly addressed by management.)
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We have already said and reaffirm our commitment to respect our contractors and our hourly staff colleagues.

This will include being unable to work if you are ill.
if you want to work, we can help you.

What we do, especially in times like these, can have incredible benefits.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
Our request is that you talk to your managers, so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some work is deemed essential.
There are certain things we should keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising Team (among others) perform important tasks, for which additional support may be required.
We will begin the process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and focus on supporting the essentials for our mission.
There is much work to be done for all of us, let us focus only on the most important projects.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Once the global movement is over, we don't plan to "work twice as long to get the job done".
You don't have to work overtime to keep up with unrealistic work schedules.
We accept that the situation has changed and when appropriate, we will work towards setting new goals and timetables.
What happens to APP?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Our intention is to propose to extend our 2019-2020 plan, so as to include those people who have more time to prepare budgets to prioritize important tasks, care for themselves and care for their dependents, who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for shorter periods.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the ongoing planning workload and stress throughout the organisation.
next week we will present our proposal to the board and as soon as we get confirmation we will update our representatives and teams on the next steps.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Last week we learned that an employee from our SF-area has been confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus.

They use high-quality disinfectant solutions that are used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the edges of the elevators that come to our floor.
This building uses its own safety measures which help keep its tenants safe.
We are pleased that when we decide to return, these offices will be fully operational.
Our DC office is located in WeWork areas, where we and all other DC-area employees have been shared their COVID-19 measures.
Last week, our DC office has been converted to a completely remote setup following guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in the NYC-area know, we are discussing renting a place in Brooklyn.
The talks are ongoing, but we may be late.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Long-time remote colleagues know this will be just an adjustment, and they'd like to give you some advice:
Limit your meetings to one or two hours at most.
if you need longer sessions, think about how you can split them into several days.
Make it clear on the meeting agenda and send them the materials ahead of time.
Make this video default using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to collaborate and connect directly.
To make each meeting easier, ask someone to lead it, who will monitor the chat for questions asked and check the list of speakers, and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes in collaboration).

The HR Operations Team is looking to Webinar Based Ergonomics to help increase the amount of work being delivered throughout the organisation.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to postpone Wikimedia-funded mass events like "Editathons" until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We informed them that we have learned that our request for delay and other restrictions would make it impossible to meet their agreed grant deadline, and also that no one would be punished for this delay and for changing that target.
next week we will be tracking additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community forums.

As we move forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor this impact and track our interactions with them.
Stay in touch with COVID-19 related issues.
We will be sending an invitation in your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC/ 07:00 PT.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff who live in countries that are currently severely affected.

alias,they are going to be formally acknowledging that we are going to have to take our work and responsibilities in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to work together, so that we can keep working, provide for the needs they have, and provide them with the services they depend on.
When the time comes, these planned tasks will help you.

ACE2
ACE2 is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of Ang ((1-7)), and therefore it is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metallolenzime found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type of mucous membrane protein that is activated by our enzymes on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
ACE2 extracellular domain is broken down by a second transmembrane called shades and the resultant soluble protein is released into the blood and finally dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is found in almost all organs: the membrane of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells in arteries and veins, and the smooth muscle of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
ACE2's primary function is to act as an inhibitor to ACE.
ACE angiotensin I is a hormone that is involved in the entry of vascoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn breaks down the carboxy-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can break down many other peptides including bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in coronary heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, binding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the surface of cells by the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis and transfer of both virus and enzyme to endosomes located within cells.

A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Also, patients with a high risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and cardiac arrest, were also reduced in risk by treatment with ACE inhibitors.

Recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is considered to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and has been shown to improve pulmonary hemo dynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In humans, rhACE2 has a half-life of about 10 hours and takes 30 minutes to start its effects and lasts for 24 hours.

The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications Technology and the Ministry of Health.


Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth protocols. Russia intends to introduce a geo-fencing app designed to ensure that COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and a low probability of effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to a very small proportion of the population.

Google and Amazon have imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed deep concern regarding the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially as to whether the surveillance infrastructure built to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The institutions announced eight conditions for government projects:
must be "legal, necessary and standard";
The extension of surveillance and surveillance should include sunset clauses;
The use of data for COVID-19 purposes should be limited;
must protect the security and anonymity of information and must demonstrate that it is protected on the basis of the provision;
Digital surveillance should prevent extreme discrimination and neglect;

Details not released as of 6th April 2020.
Privacy - Protected Contact Tracing is a well-established concept, with research material dating back to at least 2013.
PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has both centralized and decentralized approaches and no single protocol. The decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy - proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and mechanisms for contact tracking to mobile (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all matching is on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePath, a platform for using privacy-protected techniques when collecting or using location or road junction to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research published in the March 2020 white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic". Another similar effort is SafeTrace, a privacy technology developer created by Enigma MPC, which was originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure data hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.

9 April 2020 The Singapore Government announced that they had open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by their official government app.

He also highlighted the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be broken down into three stages:

Integration of this functionality directly into iOS, AndroidGoogle and Apple plans to address continuous monitoring issues by first delivering the system through operating system updates and then removing the threat again in the same way once the threat has been resolved.
'Drug repositioning (also called drug repair, re-profiling, retasking or therapeutic switching) is basically the use of a drug that has been approved for one disease or disorder to treat another disease.
This is the only scientific research currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 has 66 druggable proteins, each with multiple associated binding sites.
An analysis of such binding sites provides a good basis for the development of a potent antiviral against COVID-19 proteins.
SARS-2 target proteins are papane-like proteases, RNA dependency RNA polymerase, helicases, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussain AA et al. studied various candidate compounds and then analyzed their similarity to the same approved drug, so that they could develop a preclinical anti-SARS-COVID-2 potent drug and recommend it in the clinical study framework.

The FDA has not approved this treatment through clinical trial procedures and has authorized it under the EUA for experimental treatment only for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial.
The CDC states that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been validated.
The doctors have been told that this drug is used when "there is no other option".
A small study conducted by a Turkish research team in Istanbul, using chloroquine with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.

The safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure is being tested by NYU Langone Medical School.
Favipirvir has been shown to be "fully effective" in Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen.
Shenzhen, where 35 patients tested negative in 4 days, 45 patients who did not receive the test had a duration of illness of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half were given favipirvir and half received umifenovir.
The Pharmaceutical Institute of Italy reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is insufficient and elementary.

According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has been in formal talks with the Trump administration about the purchase of a drug that may be less effective in patients with severe disease because the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Caletra), which combined the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to protease.

WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir showed intravenous antiviral activity against phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona-viruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is that resistance develops from mutations that result in more serious diseases and infections.
Some previous preclinical studies have suggested that remdesivir may have a high gene resistance to resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, including two trials at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild disease and one for people with severe disease.
Two clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C administration to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 are underway; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State started testing the antibiotic azithromycin on 24th March.

b'A COVID 19 vaccine is a fictitious vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The World Health Organization (WHO) said at the end of February 2020 that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which is the cause of the virus, is not expected to be available for 18 months.
In April, a Phase I safety study was underway on five vaccine candidates.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
The outbreak in 2020 has led to a massive investment and research in developing vaccines.

As announced in April, the CEPI initiative's priorities for developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, scale planning and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists were informed that research and development was underway on 10 different technology platforms to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 in early 2020.
The key platform objectives in the Phase I Security Study are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Episode I developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Early I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino Biologies, Adenovirus type 5 vector)

The Phase I-II trials are primarily safety and antigenicity testing and are typically randomized, placebo controlled and multi-site to determine the most accurate, qualitative dose.
Phase III trials are generally more participant-based, involving a control group and testing for vaccine efficacy to prevent disease and for adverse events after adequate dosing.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 vaccines have not yet been evaluated in humans (still undergoing "preclinical" research).

The vaccine they are developing may not be safe or effective.
Previous research to evaluate the efficacy of ACE2-transgenic vaccines in COVID-19 specific animals such as mice, other laboratory animals and primates other than humans suggests the need for international coordination to ensure biosecurity-level 3 control measures and standardised safety procedures for handling live virus.
SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animals.


As MERS got stronger, it was thought that ongoing research on SARS would provide a useful model for finding a vaccine and a drug for MERS-CoV infection.

The post on social media has sparked a discussion about the conspiracy that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents that emerged as evidence from various social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS corona virus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Symptoms are fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms to the onset of obstruction is usually five days, but can range from two to 14 days.
Most patients have mild symptoms, while some patients develop progressive symptoms resulting in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 deaths.

They are expelled by the respiratory system and fall on the ground or surface, so they do not carry the infection over long distances.

The virus can survive on any surface for 72 hours.
The first three days after onset of symptoms are the most contagious, but it can also spread in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages. Nasagras®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®®

The majority of countries in all six WHO Regions have reported local transmission.
Patients with viral blockade may experience no symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or feeling stressed, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and blue faces and lips; immediate hospital admission is advised.
Symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or a scratchy throat.
Some patients had less frequent symptoms of esophageal reflux, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some patients in China initially showed symptoms of chest pains and heart palpitations.
Some patients have progressed to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some cases it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who developed symptoms appeared 11.5 days after infection. Reports show that not all infected patients develop symptoms.
The role of non-symptomatic vectors in infection is not yet clear, but from preliminary evidence they are thought to be involved in the spread of disease.
The prevalence of asymptomatic cases is not yet known and is being studied, with 20% of confirmed cases reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) as asymptomatic until hospitalization.
China's National Health Commission started including asymptomatic patients in daily cases from April 1; out of 166 infected patients reported that day, 130 (78%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of screening.
Both saliva and spit carry a high viral load.
When you speak out loud, you emit more noise than when you speak normally.


Some medical procedures, such as tubal insertion and heart and blood vessel resuscitation, can release a source of radiation through the respiratory tract and thus transmit it through the air.
When there is a concern about transmission via the vagina, the risk is considered low, and people with symptoms are more likely to contract the virus.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease can spread, it can spread from one person to two to three people, and it can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
The virus has been found to survive for up to a day on paperboard, up to three days on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99 percent copper.

Other remedies, such as benzakonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a type of surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In one study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken within two days of admission to hospital.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest number of pathogens, and in the sixth patient, the highest number of pathogens was found in the next day's test.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel highly respiratory symptomatic coronavirus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the Wuhan Acute Respiratory Disease Center.
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by the presence of a variety of viruses that are related to it in nature.

COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs, as the virus reaches the stem cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the second type of lung air cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spike to bind to ACE2 and enter the stem cells.
12% of patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, have also experienced severe cardiac pain and are frequently found in severe illness.

ACE2 receptor is abundant in the heart and is involved in the functioning of the heart.
The incidence of blood clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) has been found to be high in severe COVID-19 patients, possibly due to improper diagnosis. The autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 have also found diffuse alveolar damage and inflammatory white cells in the lungs.

Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-inflammatory T-cells have been associated with the appointment of inflammatory IL-6-inflammatory monocytes and acute pulmonary pathology in these COVID-19 patients.
The autopsy also showed the penetration of white blood cells.
The World Health Organization has published a series of guidelines for testing for this disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the accepted method of testing.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained from the throat secretions, but respiratory secretions or saliva samples can also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours or a couple of days.

Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that detect the virus.


FDA in the United States approved the first point of care test for use later that month on March 21, 2020. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, suggest methods for detecting infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of disease.
In the initial infection, bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity was common with peripheral, asymmetrical and background distributions.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominance, strange pewing (lobelar septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and condensation may occur.

The following are some of the important findings of autopsy:
What you can see with the naked eye: inflammation of the lung wall, heart valve pain, stiffness of the lungs, and swelling of the lungs
The following are four types of severe pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: Pneumonia, overexpansion of lung cells, disproportionate enlargement of lung cells, interstitial inflammation with white cell infiltration, and multi-spectral growth of large cells
Pneumonia: Impairment of the lungs and uncontrolled discharge from the lungs
Diffuse alveolar damage is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe oxygen deprivation.
Pneumonia curable: Uncontrolled secretion in the cavities of the lungs and interstitial fibrosis of the lungs
Blood: internal secretion and accumulation in arteries (disseminated intravascular coagulation); leukocytoblastic reaction
measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends that you keep a towel in front of your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze. If you don't have a towel, cover your nose with your hand.

CDC has recommended that face coverings be worn when walking in public places to limit infection from people who do not show symptoms. Social distancing is aimed at reducing exposure of infected people to large crowds. Schools, offices have been closed, travel restrictions have been imposed and large crowds have been prohibited.


CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when they see that their hands are dirty, before eating and after touching their nose, and after coughing or sneezing.
CDC further recommends that hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol be used, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizer products are not available, the World Health Organization recommends two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, the antibiotic activity is produced by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to inhibit the growth of microbes in alcohol; it is 'not an active ingredient for hand disinfection.'
Glycerol has been added as a moisture preservative.
Patients are being managed through supportive care, which includes oxygenation, fluid therapy and other support to vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they are carrying the virus should wear a plain face mask.
Oxygen therapy has been used for respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being discovered.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost immunity.
WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The US serious pathologists and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies under a single open source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment has been identified for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals suggest using paracetamol instead of ibuprofen at first.
To minimize the risk of virus transmission, precautions should be taken, especially during procedures that create spraying of bodily fluids in the air, such as intravenous or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends that healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients be kept in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) with general precautions, contact care and airborne transmission. CDC has also outlined guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended Preventive Equipment: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be preferred over face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air, but, in other applications, their effect against a specific biological medium cannot be guaranteed.

Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require medical ventilation or other alternatives, but a small percentage of cases are.
The type of medical respiratory assistance available to patients due to respiratory obstruction caused by COVID-19 is being continuously studied for people in hospitals. The procedure of intravenous tubing can be avoided by nasal high flow tubing or by bivalent positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two medications are equally effective in treating patients with serious illnesses.
Some doctors prefer mechanical ventilation treatments, if available, as they limit the spread of airborne pathogens, as opposed to the use of a ventilation tube. The incidence of serious illness is very high in elderly people. In those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age.
Even in many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, so a sudden increase in the number of severe cases of COVID-19 could limit the capacity of the health system to handle the issue of hospitalization.

About 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China had to end up in the ICU.
As severe respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes more complicated and oxygen delivery becomes more and more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control capabilities and high PEEPs are needed to reduce the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by ventilators while providing a greater supply of oxygen.
Older ventilators may not have access to high capacity PEEPs.
Research on potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are undergoing trials since then.
Remdesivir is the most promising.

Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
WHO recommended volunteers participate in trials to study the efficacy and safety of these potential treatments. FDA has provisionally approved the use of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in patients whose lives are at risk.
They haven't gone through any chemical trials to determine if they are effective and safe for this disease.

BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress and economic downturn are the root causes of the threat to people's mental health and wellbeing".
These conditions may have few or no symptoms, which is similar to other respiratory illnesses such as colds and coughs.
The mild cases usually heal within two weeks, whereas the severe cases can take three to six weeks to heal.
Based on information on other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, it can be said that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at higher risk, but there is no information available about COVID-19 in this regard. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
COVID-19 may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severely affected individuals, resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure, etc.
COVID-19 associated complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver, etc.
6% of COVID-19 hospitalizations have been associated with impaired blood clotting, increased prothrombin time, and 4% of these groups have been associated with impaired renal function.

Hong Kong hospital officials found that some people who had recovered from the disease had a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity, and lung scans showed that organs were damaged.
This can lead to post-ICU syndrome.


It is believed that such cases may be prolonged rather than recurrent.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated in an animal and is spread through infection.

The Lancet, published in January, published a study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 which showed that 1 December 2019 was the earliest date for symptom onset.
WHO has officially announced 8 December 2019 as the date of onset of symptoms.

These numbers vary by region and by time period, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the number of trials, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health.

According to Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infectious mortality rate (IFR), which displays the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time bound and they are based on a specific population infected by the case version.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may be an indication of how many people are infected.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Gengelt was exposed to the disease during the Carnival Festival and spread to young people, which led to a relatively low mortality rate and may not be the case for all COVID-19 deaths.
Plus, the German health care system is not so burdened.
In the Netherlands, maybe about 3% of people may have antibodies, as reported by blood donors.
69 (0.004%) people have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality of this pandemic are different for women and men.
Studies in China and Italy have shown that men have a higher mortality rate.
Men in their 50s are at highest risk, and the difference between men and women in mortality has been the lowest since the 1990s.
China had a male mortality rate of 2.8% and a female mortality rate of 1.7%.
The exact cause of this gender gap is unknown, but it may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender-based immunity gaps, lower smoking prevalence in women, and the development of co-morbidity conditions such as high blood pressure in men at a younger age than in women, all may be contributing factors to higher mortality rates in men.
57% of those infected in Europe were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.

Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.

WHO announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tendros Edhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of this disease occurred in Lakshmi: 31 December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, following international naming recommendations, and with the aim of avoiding stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in addition to the public communication.
Both this disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".

In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases as interim names for these viruses and diseases, following the 2015 guidelines against using place names for these diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.

For example, when a hospital in Italy needed ventilator valves urgently and the supplier couldn't supply it in time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed 100 valves overnight.

It was discovered that humans were able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
The Government is conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccine and drug.
In March, WHO launched a "Solidarity Trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most effective existing antiviral compounds.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The study of SARS-CoV-2 is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neurons to enter human cells.
Tres vaccination strategies have been developed so far.
First, researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
The purpose of using such a virus, whether it is an inactive or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the immediate immune response of the human body.
Another strategy is subunit vaccines, which aim to create a vaccine that makes the immune system susceptible to a specific subunit of the virus.

A third strategy is about nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, an innovative technology for making vaccines).
Any of these three strategies require testing for safety and efficacy of an experimental vaccine.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent conservation has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, over 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Seven trials were being evaluated from already approved treatments for malaria, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese research involves multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine trials on Phase III of Remedicivir being conducted in several countries, according to a report submitted in late April.
According to the April 2020 report, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is underway.
According to the March 2020 report, there is provisional evidence for exposure to Remedicivir.
Remedicivir treatment patients showed clinical improvement.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
,,,.......................................................................
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram of this drug, noting that doubling its dosage is extremely dangerous and can even be fatal.
FDA issued emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on March 28, 2020, at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19.

Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further testing following demonstration of low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early spike protein priming via transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 penetration via interaction with ACE-2 mechanisms.

Combined with serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storm, this means resisting such development, which has been considered a cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, a neural antigen of interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA based on a preliminary study for the treatment of a steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by a different cause called CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosilezumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 to people in need is being explored as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it didn't have any significant effect.
Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action, by which passive antibody therapy against SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy are being developed, for example, using synthetic monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convolutional serums, which contain the fluid proteins of the blood of recovered patients and which contain antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for rapid growth.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, contracted COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
