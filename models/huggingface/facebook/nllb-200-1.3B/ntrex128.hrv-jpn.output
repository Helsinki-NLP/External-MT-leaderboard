Welsh MPs are worried they'll look like Muppets

This was due to plans to rename the chamber the Welsh Parliament.
MPs from all political spectrums are worried they might be subject to a purge.

for readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means jerk.

The Welsh Conservative stated that his group was open to changing the name, but that the MWP in speech could quickly turn into the Muppet.
w Welsh is pronounced similarly to u in Yorkshire English.
Of course, the final decision on how the MPs will be titled will be up to them.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that met with widespread support for changing the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.



n the debate on the bill, the House of Representatives will have the deciding vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the country's name

The purpose of the vote is to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece where there is a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents an appropriation of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.


St. Martin's Bells went silent as the churches in Harlem struggled to survive
"The elderly people I spoke to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
"People are socializing in a different way today", he declared.
Bar is no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly stay
On the other hand, when it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think and will sooner or later be found again.
He added that the churches could replace the apartment buildings with apartments for people who would not be helping the other churches in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he said,and sooner will come the day when these churches will be closed completely because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held worship services nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who were opposed to hiring or promoting blacks.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St Martin's, proudly called the carillon the "Bells of the Poor".
Cultural treasure and irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that this was also the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing the large carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin did not replace him.
What's been going on in St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Sacristy, the governing body of the diocese made up of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July out of concern that the diocese would seek to transfer costs to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California
According to official press release, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for a lobster in California on Saturday, the opening day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego station KSWB-TV that he and his friends were diving for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when they heard the boy's call for help, and then he and a group of others rowed to the scene of the attack to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was the excitement of catching lobster, but then he realized he was yelling "It bit me!"
He bit me!
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn apart.
I made sure everyone got out of the water:There's a shark in the water!, added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
"The shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined to be a non-threatening shark species".
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
s plans to enter the UK beauty market
s is becoming a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style beauty counters and engaging specialist retailers.

Investing in cosmetics is one way that supermarkets are trying to take advantage of shelf space once reserved for TVs, microwave ovens, and home appliances.
s said it would double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
and the existing range of LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
supermarket is also relaunching its boutique decorative cosmetics range, so most of the products will be vegan-friendly, which is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
also, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be using the concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Mike Coupe, CEOSainsbury's, stated that outlets will increasingly look like department stores as this supermarket chain tries to resist favourable stores such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitat's departments because it bought both chains two years ago, which it claims boosted grocery sales and made those acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments had failed.
Sainsbury's went into joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but it ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from the pharmacy in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed the sale by Sainsbury's of its pharmaceutical business in 281 Celestia, to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
He claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by placing a range of luxury skincare products in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, commented:We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We've also invested in a dedicated training team who will be on the customer's side and give them advice.
The attractive environment and accessible locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits.
Peter Jones is furious
Dragons star Den Peter Jones left to flare up in anger after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11million deal with his brand to focus on her new deals with the department store chain Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their Truly brand of homewear and fashion accessories.
their brand is comparable to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand of Goop.
The host of This Morning (37) on Instagram has announced she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones to cook in anger by withdrawing from a last-minute, lucrative joint venture to focus on her own shiny new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
This deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire has stunned everyone involved in this business.
nhi could not believe what happened on Tuesday so close to the start of the whole line.
Marlow Headquarters is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could lead to millions of dollars in losses for the company, due to the large investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and the possible additional delay in the launch of the line.
And it could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
Couples are on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
We don't want to comment on his business activities.

Why did President Trump give so many concessions?
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I didn't make any concessions.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have stalled.

He noted that instead the US still did not lift sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his rally speech.
We're doing great with North Korea, he said.
We were threatened with war with North Korea.

We have a great relationship now.

Indonesia: Tsunami and earthquake devastated island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.

Sadly, in many cases they have been very clear about not seeking international help, so it's all a bit problematic, said Ms Sumbung.

The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though the warning was in effect, probably contributed to the loss of life.

Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge has scored the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea.
He put the ball on his left foot before he kicked it to the opposite side.
The ball flew high above the net towards the top right corner.
The ball eventually escaped Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and entered the net.
It was demanding to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once.
Chelsea were 1-0 down at half-time after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning around somewhere in the middle of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful passing ball that led to Hazard's goal.
Hazard went around the defense and hit the ball in the net with his left foot on the opposite court next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.

Cromwell statue in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the midst of the debate over the end of history
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th-century way of thinking and a piece of historiography for a man who is still considered by many to be worthy of honor.
Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, to be the defender of Parliament from outside pressure.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a distinctly distinctive figure who represents one side of that division.

Pig Killer killed Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
Yuan, a man whose name is only mentioned, was found dead with his arteries cut and covered in blood near a barn in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.

n the morning, he was found dead by his cousin, and the door to the neighboring pig house was open.
i seiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
According to the report, forensic examination confirmed that a 250-pound pig bitten the breeder to death.
Wu, a cousin, said:My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated
                                                                                                                                                                                      
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
                                                                                                                                                                       
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
10 years ago, a 300-pound pig had trapped a Welsh farmer with a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate farmers in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disinfectant".
They're just played.
They're nibbling, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
just need to show respect, he said.

October is likely to see major temperature changes throughout the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this results in dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
n the next few days, the summer heat will continue to rise and expand again.
The United States is expected to experience a warm start in early October, with temperatures reaching 27 degrees Celsius in most of the central and eastern United States, from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast points to a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
n the meantime, the political debate continued, and the reporters interrupted their regular program to announce a last-minute twist that Friday: the agreement reached by Jeff Flake, the senator from Arizona, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, while drunk, had touched her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in his ardent testimony that he was absolutely certain that this never happened.
The Friday hearing was probably watched by over 20.4 million people, according to a Nielsen report.
The company has been counting average viewerships on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately available for the viewers for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble measuring how many people are watching content in their offices.
To put it more simply, this is an audience that is similar in size to the one that watches a football game or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest average viewership of 5.69 million during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.

He stood for several minutes with his eyes down as he was shown live on CNN by protesters who were showering him with insults.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Crees he's telling the truth to this country?
"You have power, but so many women are helpless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he would say more at the committee hearing.
hours later, all cable and TV networks were watching live as the Committee on the Judiciary was about to vote on referring Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote by the entire Senate.
Flake said he'd do it only on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the candidate within the next week, which is what the Democrats, who are in the minority, have been demanding.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons, and then a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.

Volcanoes throwing ash on Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatapetl volcano have reached southern Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
Center has been monitoring multiple thunderstorms and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have been noticing increased activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since the 2017 magnitude 7.1 earthquake that shook central Mexico.
Don Goyo is an active volcano since 1994.

14 people were hospitalized for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, local media reported.




demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to go by another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations with his wife, said he no longer hopes for Catalonia to gain independence.
We had one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents crying from happiness for being able to vote, but now we're stuck, he said.

Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations in support of the police on his phone, said the clash was fueled by politicians on both sides.

Meng's shot brought Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Meng's first goal for Livingston brought the win
The new Scottish Premiership club Livingston have surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit to only his second defeat in 18 games at the helm of the club from Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Meng's shot proved decisive as Gary Holt's team squared off with the Iberian in seconds.
Gerrard's team is still unbeaten in the Premier League this season, and next Saturday they play Hearts, the league's top club, trailing by eight points.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has yet to experience a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against the dying guests
Holt's team should have been leading before they scored that goal, given that their directness in attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a breakthrough, but was too slow on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only aim the ball wide after slipping to intercept Craig Halkett's head kick towards the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause inconvenience to the guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
Rangers failed to stop a free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly assisting Mengi who scored in the middle of the goal.
Till that point, the Rangers had mostly control of the ball, but they faced an impenetrable home defense, so goalie Liam Kelly was mostly out of action.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goalie Alan McGregor's legs went to Scott Pittman, and Lithgow directed a wide kick from another organised attack by Livingston.
Long shots failed to cross Livingston's goal line, and two eleven's were not awarded after Halkett's clash with substitute Glen Middleton and one for playing hand.
Brilliant by Livingston analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great game and a Livingston score.
All of them excelled, continuing to exceed the expectations of the entry.
their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but much credit goes to Holt and the way he's brought the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the helm of a well-organized defense, and Menga throughout the game did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to breathe.
t the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were a long way from the standard they set with good play under Gerrard.
They haven't been able to finish the ball, they've only made one hole in the home team, and that's a call to arms for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdoğan hailed with mixed feelings in Cologne

It's the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.

Erdoğan'ın yeni büyük bir cami açmak için Köln'e gitti.
Türkiye'nin dışındaki en büyük Türk nüfusu bu şehirde.

And hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators including a large number of Kurds raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him back to the country.
The confrontational demonstrations reflect the division caused by a visitor whom some German Turks hail as a hero and others attack as an autocrat.

Rosa
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa moves its remaining strength over the desert southwest and brings the threat of flash floods.
National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for an area from western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should be approaching Phoenix late Monday in the rain and passing right over it by Tuesday.
Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have produced a tropical storm or depression within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
The Commission considers that the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,
For those out of danger of flash floods, Rosa could come as a lifeline as the region is hit by drought.
Though flooding is a major hazard, some of this precipitation could be useful because the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the US map of drylands, slightly over 40% of Arizona has been affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
The hurricane's path first approached the coast along the Mexican Baja California peninsula.
Rosa was still hurricane-force on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour, and was located some 400 miles [620 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 20 miles per hour.
The storm hit the cooler waters of the Pacific and thus weakened.
Tropical storm force is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant risk of flooding.
The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to northwest Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, with a possible maximum of 250 mm, reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression which will then move across Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The main danger expected from Rose or her remains are very heavy rains in the Baja California peninsula, northwest Sonora and the US desert southwest, announced the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in deserts and mountainous terrain.

Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party
A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's cruel and shameful tactics, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the wrath and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were teenagers.
Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charge she brought.
President Obama said on Saturday that on that day, the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"Vote for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service", he told his supporters gathered in West Virginia.
President Kavanaugh's nomination
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am, he said.
I'm always fighting for the best candidates.
Trump has stated that the mission of the Democrats is to create resistance and obstruction.

The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
While the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't immediately run and died, said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB at a press conference in Jakarta.
Tsunami did not come alone, it dragged with it cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived", he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.

The ensuing shocks continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) in a statement said that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was twice the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the city's geographical location at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.

According to Nugro, the number of casualties and damage may have been greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicenter.
Communications are completely cut off and we have no information from Donggala.
"More than 300,000 people live in this area", says a Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers have been sent to the affected areas.
Thisisalreadya tragedy,but the situation could get much worse, the statement said.


Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.

The situation is extremely bad.
Although World Vision personnel from Donggale successfully arrived in Palu where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents set up in their office yard, they passed on scenes of destruction on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses, he stated.
The situation is extremely difficult.


It hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial-level disaster, said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "OK, it's a national disaster" we can get international aid, but such a situation hasn't been declared yet.
When Palu fell on the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing were still hoping that their loved one would be one of those miracles that mitigate the dark scenarios of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.

Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, was training the two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
"Given the many years I've spent paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon recalled how after news of the Roa Roa Hotel demolition spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palua contestants who were participating in the beach festival.
t his messages are still marked with a gray button instead of two blue buttons.
I think that means the messages weren't delivered, he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.

West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's creators said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who had cancelled for "emotional reasons".
Besides being an abbreviation for his current stage name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti, West said earlier this year in an interview about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
Also, I am you, I am we, that's us.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a string of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
West's former associate, Jay-Z, has been playing with versions of his name with no hyphen and a hyphen and a capital letter.

The US should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount invested in research in this area, said AI investor and expert Kai Fu Lee who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans regarding AI even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy in principle.
n the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to be the number one country in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start considering that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence, said Lee.
Double the investment could double the chances that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence will come to the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
AI Great Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order is published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the best American player, Othello, and later he was the director of research at Microsoft and the president of Google's China division.
Lee praised the previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
Lee says that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's corporations", said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired some of the brightest minds from universities to work on AI research over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
I think PhDs in AI should be offered green cards automatically, he said.
China's State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China National Science Foundation provides financial resources to individuals in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide financial resources to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
THE DECORNATION OF ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE

Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name

Greece has a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a seizure of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.

President Gyorge Ivanov has stated that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote has cast doubt on whether the votes will meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?
The EU has also been involved in the negotiations on the accession of the Republic of Macedonia to the European Union.
I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has stated that as of 1:00 p.m., no irregularities have been reported.

I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital city of Skopje.

54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the parliament in Skopje set up a small stage and moved chairs in front of the tent set up by those who boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as servants, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO, Zaev said after the vote.
positive resultwill representacertaining our future, he said.


Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
To be successful, the exit must be 50% plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of a pro-Western government since it took office last May.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the whole Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence and won 2-0 for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made the win insanely simple, scoring in the 65th minute.
Argentine striker received a midfield addition at the start of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defenders and then made it onto the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender, and then he overtook a few others on the edge of Brighton's space.
He then added the ball to Sterling's left.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguero who hit the right-handed kickoff into the right side of the net and beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero has some difficulty with his foot, reported to the press by Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola.
We planned to play about 55, 60 minutes.
Tis what happened.
He scored a goal at that moment.
Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues the starting position in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero hit the ball deep in Brighton during that game.
He made a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sané had pushed the ball several times before guiding Sterling to the podium.
Sky Blues striker kicked the ball into the net before slipping into the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.

Rockies win the Nationals 5-2 Friday night to secure a wild-card spot, but they're still hoping to win their first title.

Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nationals have yet to announce a Sunday starter, but in that case, they're reportedly inclined to offer Scherzer a chance to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitching area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
Washington right-hander has posted a 18-7 record this season, a 2.53 earned run average (ERA), and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.

The Labour Party no longer respects difference of opinion.
Doesn't tolerate the expression of personal views

After all, I'm the last in a line of Labour MPs who have been told they're not welcome and all because we said what we had on our minds.
I believe my law partner, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was so strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the censorship bill for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.

Unfortunately, these days, many meetings are held in a different tone, and the promise of a "kind, gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It's becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues who I thought shared similar political views started demanding from me a drastic change of mind and taking positions that I would never have otherwise agreed with  whether it was national security or the EU single market.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's not just my experience.
I do know that I've been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been made to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily avalanche of sexist or racist comments, but never give up.
one of the aspects of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the tolerance of abusive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn last week stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer consider different opinions and that with every motion of no confidence or change in the electoral rules we are becoming a narrower party.
"Many times in the last two years, I've been advised to keep my head down, to keep it down, and to be quiet, and to tell me that everything will be all right."
t is not why I went into politics.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
nnoonein the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I want to say to those who voted for the motion on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grappling with Brexit which will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my commitment to the leadership of the Labour Party.

Melrose: 38: 17 undefeated Ayr heading for the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final score, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
now they've climbed to the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
n the end, their superb defense and their better use of the opportunity... have led them to victory, and Coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be pleased.
"Hitherto, they've tested us in every game and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose Club said, """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" "T"" "T" "T" "T"" "T"T"T"T"T"T"T"T"T"T"T"T"T"TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT

Climo increased Ayr's lead by 11 points before scoring a goal in the half and making a solo attempt to turn Ayr's score 17:5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and a try by Patrick Anderson, who realised Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, and this by an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The winger, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to knock out the Clima who did not have the ball; from the penalty line, MacPherson carried out the laying behind Ayra in a full-stroke breakthrough.
Climo realized, as he had done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took a high kick from David Armstrong and sent sideman Gregor Henry on his fifth attempt to the home team.

The Sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes to be granted access to the Pacific Ocean by the court
The Marines are patrolling the naval center, which is packed with elevators, in La Paz.
The flag of the ocean is reportedly displayed on public buildings.

It's our duty to return it.
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline to Chile during the 19th century resource conflict is still alive as is the longing for renewed Pacific voyages.
As Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling expected on October 1, after a five-year process, these hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
Bolivia has momentum, spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is optimistically looking forward to the outcome, said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president who is facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
We're on the way back to the Pacific Ocean, he promised late August.

The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, means that the case "was less complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
n't promote Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have set them back.
"The issue of access to the sea is currently being taken up by the Bolivian leadership", said Zarate.
Morales's war rhetoric has buried any goodwill in Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia e Chile o continuar o diálogo, mas depois de isto, vai ser extremamente difícil negociar.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.

Boliviawill have an unprecedented opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit, he said.
also denied that Morales still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America used the maritime issue as a political ploy.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The verdict is a chance to see that we need to get past.

This summer, the extremely unfashionable hats made Instagram, and these designers posted their creations that attract attention to the track.
The most prominent example was Valentino's, a large beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like bezel that completely "takes over" the model's head.
Other bulky accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but these accessories were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
many coloured masks had sewn lips and looked more like hannibal lecter than high fashion pieces.
One creature resembled a diver's suit with a fan and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with melted ice cream.
Follow the big fashion saying luck is on your side.
Stylists predict that giant hats might be coming to the luxury stores in your neighborhood.
La Bomba, a straw hat with a rim about 60 cm wide that has been seen on many famous and famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that took social media to the runway has sent another huge creation a strawberry beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that wore it.
The orange-red sapphire bag, decorated with sapphire beads and white leather linen, was a showcase in Jacquemus's 2019 La Riviera summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
I'm expecting big hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer. With the designer leaving such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories.
John Edward: Language Skills that the World's Citizens Need
Scotland's independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which was continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test scores, and further emphasised by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and their parents.

As the education sector can design and implement the said school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the preferred and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said:If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
Si tu parles à un enfant dans sa langue maternelle, tu lui parles au cœur.
This statement is a powerful reminder that we cannot use English alone if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's final exams show that the highest marks in languages were achieved by pupils from independent schools.
68% of students who learned foreign languages got excellent grades.

This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as electives are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) in the curriculum of independent schools, as elsewhere.
The UK Employment and Skills Commission's 2014 survey revealed that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of a labour force with language skills.
language skills are becoming an increasingly important skill in preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are key in a globalised world.

A person who speaks more than one language can communicate directly with strangers, giving him an advantage over his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4000 adults, 75% of UK respondents do not know a foreign language well enough to be able to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of respondents, or 15% of them.

If children learn more languages, especially those of developing countries, they will have a better chance of finding good jobs.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will choose languages that are considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
whatever your child's interests, independent schools will always have a wide range of choices, as well as teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scotland's independent schools provide an environment where children learn to prepare and equip themselves with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be overlooked that in today's global business world, language skills are so important to the future of any country that they must be reflected in education.

The evening gathering at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month where he won with over 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey from West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in the polls, said political scientist Simon Haedar of West Virginia University to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA left heart on the field before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the pairs' Sunday afternoon might be just what was needed to turn the Ryder Cup around.
"Luck turns around" is a saying that holds true in sports and that athletes believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who's the wheel of fortune now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they have four.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The Europeans are up by four points with 12 points remaining in the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouragement from his dueling with Justin Thomas, with whom he scored three of his four points after a full day of play.
Spieth has played killer from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheers of the fans grew louder as Spieth and Thomas trailed by two points, culminating in a crucial path that brought Spieth to the no-solution.
After the 15-hole victory, he followed with a similar cheerleading roar, which can be seen in the hope and belief that the Americans can turn things around.
Tu dois juste te concentrer et penser à ton jeu, a déclaré Spieth.
Then that's all the players have left.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but irresistible European couple has the maximum number of points and can't make a mistake.
Moliwoodwas the only couple who didn't lose a point on a Saturday afternoon, but he avoided bogey on a Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on a Friday morning.
The winning streak, and the incredible energy between Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are the players who need to win on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than these two who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris' Le Golf National.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
t yet it's too soon to talk about a European winning.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly caught Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples game.
1 bogey and 2 double bogey on the first 9 holes of the course buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't dig out.

It's fascinating to watch couples games up close because you can see the interactions of the players in pairs, hear the advice they give and those they don't give, and study the strategy that can be changed in the moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team, and are coming into the final day with a significant lead, but this paired game has also shown that the US team has the necessary fighting, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europeans enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
The Europeans are entering the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's doubles, with a significant 10-6 lead over the USA.
dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led by four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in their quest to win the trophy that was stripped from them at Hazeltine two years ago, were superior to the US team in the morning games in pairs, with a score of 3 to 1.
Team USA showed greater fighting in pairs winning two games, but the difference in points was already big.
To win the trophy, the Jim Fury teams must collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first rookie from a European team to win four straight points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood, after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points in a pair game in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they proved superior in a game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who hasn't had a perfect performance in two games on Saturday, has made some brilliant moves, but now he's got 19 losses out of 29 games in fourball and doubles and seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning's fourballs to return to the doubles with partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepke, the world's number one and number three players.
Though Europeans did not go all the way smoothly on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Triple champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, setting the record high for their U.S. team.
They first beat Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Two times in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team that was four points behind the rest of the field has managed to come back in individual games, even though Furyk's team only needs a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of backlog, it looks like their Sunday counterattack is going to be tough.
North Korea has declared no chance for unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance for North Korea to unilaterally disarm and give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.

Tota,we have not received a satisfactory responsefrom the United States of America,he added.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️


North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the US has demanded that Pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for easing the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization before then and increases pressure through sanctions to forcefully achieve its goal, and even opposes the declaration of an end to war, Ri added.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a delusion of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that continuing sanctions increases mistrust.
Ri did not mention whether there are plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting which the US president talked about earlier this week at the UN.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, this year at the United Nations praised Kim for his courageous disarmament, but added that they still had a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no timeframe for denuclearization, adding:It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until complete, final and verified denuclearization.
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programs.
Pompeo met with Riy at the UN General Assembly and then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea called him out after a few hours because of gangster demands.
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex which will be achieved if the United States takes appropriate action.

Harvard students take a course on how to get a good rest
Harvard University has launched a new sleep training course for all students in an attempt to combat the increasingly pervasive culture of caffeine-induced learning and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world's best university often have no idea of the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea for the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
I was at the end of class, and this girl came up to me and said, "Why did I only learn this in my last year of college?"
She said nobody told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
This year's first course explains to students how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic achievement and overall health.
"I'm not sure what I'm doing here". "I'm not sure what I'm doing here". "I'm not sure what I'm doing here".
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
one of these tasks included a student bedroom picture where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, tennis shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and lights, how sleep deprivation affects performance, and how important sleep routine is.
Throughout the class, students also learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map is then displayed with interactive icons that encourage students to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that student behavior won't change immediately.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The culture of studying all night long before exams is still there, says the professor, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be good quality sleep. Sleep also helps fight obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, putting it in a state of starvation and causing constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending his first year classes at Harvard.

Rangers 1: 0 Meng's goal defeated Gerrard's boys
Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Meng's shot crushed Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the game with a 1-0 victory for Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to secure their first away win since their February triumph and 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his side are now eight points behind the leading Ladbrokes in the Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to run out of inspiration and it didn't look like they were going to tie the score.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has climbed to third with just one home run behind Hibernian.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Gerrard made eight changes to his flanks and so he went alongside Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same setup as Livingston who took Hearts to the line last week and would have been delighted that his well-designed setup had stifled any attempt by the opponent.
Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They had a chance to score two minutes after Mengo was first sent off, giving Scott Pittman a chance to go for Alan McGregor's goal, however, the goalkeeper missed the opportunity.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to pass an inaccurate kick to the back rows.
Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, it seemed like they were playing with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos, for sure, felt that the referee should have given him the 11th in 15 minutes after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not consider the Colombian's request.
Rangers managed to get just two balls into the goal in the first half, but for former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, a headshot by Lassana Coulibaly and a stupid shot by Ovie Eary didn't pose much of a problem.
Though Livingston's 34-minute play slowed the game down, nobody can deny their effort.
Rangers again failed to use Jacobs' deep return ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson who retained his composure and chose Mengu for an easy finish to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The substitution had almost immediate effect as the winger added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett performed one long punch after another.
Holt's side could extend the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively knocked out Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide entry from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late for the 11th because he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes away this time.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now comes a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years and a few days ago
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention he later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been a mainstay of science since its inception, and has become a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, starring the seemingly incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear atoms reacting to radioactivity in minerals.
Look at that, it's just coming out!
HansGeiger starved in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells and destroy them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure involves removing immune system cells from the patient and converting them into a laboratory.
cells are treated so that they can recognize the protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected into the patient
The experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one case, the ovarian cancer had been gone for over 18 months by a woman who had been given a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells.
The procedure involves extracting immune system cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory to recognize a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer, and re-injecting the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 stimulates the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
Similar approach to extracting immune system cells from a patient and teaching them how to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined the debate on Trump after being a guest on Saturday Night Live and supported him, wearing a cap that read "Make America Great Again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break-in performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President in 2020.
After performing a third song at the "Ghost Town" night, during which he wore a cap that read "Make America Great Again", he continued to speak out against the Democrat and reiterated his support for Trump.
So often I talk to white people and they tell me: How can you like Trump, he's a racist.
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have moved out of America long ago, he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the US Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual abuse allegations.
Although not aired, a recording of West's speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
t is not known if the publication of the Rock was an attempt to woo West.
West also complained to the audience that he was being pushed backstage because of the hat he was wearing.
They pissed me off backstage.
"Don't go anywhere with that hat".
They bullied me!
They said I was drowning, reports the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You wanna see the bottom?" and said he was gonna put on his Superman coat because that means I can't tell him what to do.
"Try it with love".

West was called in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of "I love it", dressed like a Perrier bottle of mineral water, stunned many.

The host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself" and that it was absolutely wonderful.
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
And we are, she added.

He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington has succumbed to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow, the sword-bearer in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.

In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that something went wrong and wondered how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, admitted that he wanted to "face this problem very decisively".
"I personally feel very determined at this moment"where did we go wrong with manliness?" he asked.
What did we teach men, as they grew up, in relation to the problem we're facing now?
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, might be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes boys feel they have to have these certain characteristics of a man?
How can we change this?
Because something's obviously gone wrong with the boys.
He also admitted in an interview that he would not be filming the sequel to Game of Thrones after its conclusion next summer and said that he was "finished with battles and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who robs.
The actor recently revealed that he feels that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife making this show,which gave me a family and a future life,he discovered.
Rose starred in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series as Ygritte, the love interest of Keith's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% rise in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
The Commission has also assessed the impact of the measures on the environment and the environment.
The vast majority of new infections are sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.

trtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrttrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrtrttrtrttrtrtrttrtrtrttrtrttrtrttrttrttrttrttrttrttrttrtttrtttrtttrttrttttrtttrtttttrtttrtttttrtt
HIV transmission through sex is a persistent problem amongst the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it's said that discrimination against LGBT people is high.

Many cases of disease transmission in such relationships happen because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to tackle this problem, the Chinese government promised in 2003 to give free access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has leaked information about GOP senators, calling it dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
US Rep. Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican US Senators on Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democratic congresswoman assures that these claims are being spread by ultra-right individuals, as well as the website.
Lies, lies and more disgusting lies, Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked data reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill newspaper reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication of this data belongs to the office of Representative Waters, as well as information about the representative's staff member.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations is in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
These baseless allegations are completely false and absolutely false.
Ms. Waters' statement quickly attracted online critics, including former White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer.
This is a furious denial, wrote Fleischer.
It shows that Waters does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
someone who's been accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
must not be defiant.
He mustn't question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and composed.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Barbara Walters' reaction to the criticism being leveled by the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running against Waters in the general election, also took to Twitter.
It matters if it's true he wrote.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the "relevant authorities and law enforcement" of these false claims.
We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet she continued.
Johnny English: Back on duty Not interesting enough Rowan Atkinson is fighting a spy
It is now common in every new British film to ask for messages about Brexit, and it seems to be the case in the new screen adaptation of the action series Johnny English whose first sequel, titled Johnny English was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with the title Johnny English Rides Again.
Will a twisted satire of our apparent worthlessness become a new national export opportunity?
The unfit Johnny English with his eyes peeled and his face rubbery has permission to complicate the situation again, while his name more than anything tells us that this is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where the cinema is not in English.
He is of course a dispirited secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr. Bean, and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The character is also inspired by the traveller and the mysterious worldman who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually redundant, especially now that "serious" film titles like "007" and "Mission Impossible" themselves offer elements of comedy.
The humor seems to be aimed at children, not adults. I don't think the crazy adventures of Johnny English are as innovative and focused as the Atkinson silent gags embodied in Mr. Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
Hacker broke into Britain's most secretive spy web site and revealed the identities of all the British agents, much to the horror of the agent in charge, who unfortunately appears briefly as Kevin Eldon.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'll be back soon.
And that person is going to be the reckless Johnny English who is currently employed as the principal of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: here are some cute gags because English teaches rock-style spying.
Englisch is rushed to government offices for an emergency meeting, where he reunites with Bough, his former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the over-enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential has been largely squandered.
Then two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything wrongrebound back into action and meet the beautiful and fatal woman, Opel Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Template:Citation neededMeanwhile, the PM is falling dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems, the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their thrilling journey with absurd and funny coincidences: dressed as waiters they light up a fancy French restaurant, cause massive disorder by smuggling themselves onto Volt's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headsets to find out what the interior of Volt's house looks like.

Pretty mediocre accomplishment.
And as was the case with the other Johnny English films, I again wondered if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that matched his talent?
The Labour Party is denying that it is working on a plan to make the British work four days a week and get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week and be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants bosses to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.

The Trade Union Congress supported the shift to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from the changes in the economy.
The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but represents a trend that fits into the approach this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as into the overall industrial strategy of this party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to lend its support to such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party, however, does not fully embrace this tendency.
The four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power from the hands of the faceless CEOs and the "profit-makers" in the utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not be able to recover their full stake as the Labour government could make deductions based on observed irregularities.
He also approved plans to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive equity funds so that 10% of private companies' capital would go to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak to 60 Minutes
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's finding can influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley, in an interview aired on Sunday, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility that the FBI might uncover something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after you were told, and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, unwavering, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and it really would take a strong indictment to change that, he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied anything", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
Nobody of the people she named could confirm her claims.
36 years have passed.
I don't see anything changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will be hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission ending global poverty.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or actions such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making phone calls or any other meaningful way of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.

Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of clictivism where people feel like by signing an online petition or tweeting they are actually making a difference?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded over 19 million shares by its supporters who have sought to achieve a range of different goals.
He claims that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will result in more than $37 billion by 2030 impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.

The Group estimates that the funds insured have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and implementers who are committed to helping children develop to their full potential, with a pledge to provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.

The Power of Nutrition project will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
It's going to be a long and hard road
t we'll succeed, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements have done before us, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the navy as a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports.
Washington can,if necessary, use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has been revealed by US Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russian involvement in Syria - especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I believe the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in that area as it does in Eastern Europe, southern Europe, he says.
t, he thinks there are ways and means to solve this problem.
The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the opening of sea lanes and blockade, if necessary, to make sure that their energy does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke spoke to the audience at an event hosted by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which presents itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they're basically the same.
The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less exploiting and replacing fuels, he said, and for Russia he says he is using the same trick in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The comments came at the same time as the Trump administration's intention to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third country gets involved in our energy supply, declared Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Sarah Palin mentions PTSD by Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident that occurred on Monday night.
What my son is going through, what he's going through after returning, is comparable to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are coming back with, she told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general issue that is being kept quiet for her son and other war veterans, and said they're coming back a little different, they're coming back hardened, they're coming back wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all the other members of the military, have given to this country.

18 states and D.C. support revising the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
representatives from 18 states and counties have filed a friendly report in washington on friday to provide support for a challenging asylum seeker, reports nbc news.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that she was abused by her partner and violent members of his gang, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.

New US asylum policy changed the Immigration Board decision made in 2014 that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence were allowed to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle violates this principle, states the Friends of the Court report.
The lawyers further argued that a policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the US economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.

Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, said Sessions in his policy statement on June 11.
Asylum has never been about alleviating all the problems even the most serious problems that people face every day around the world.

Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials in a statement to Reuters characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.

China's retaliatory actions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts say.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and companies.

"Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
Thus, on the newsstands on the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have about China's disturbing economic path because the media is under the heavy pressure of the Communist Party of China, he wrote.
He added that some of China's most prominent newspapers had turned down an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
Kavanaugh's debacle has kept the Republicans from voting in the run-up to the midterm elections, warn analysts.

The emotions surrounding this event have been quite stirring, and a majority of Republicans have already shown they still want to cast their vote.
Things like this can't go back, said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) latest insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday they will not forget it tomorrow or in November, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.

Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond all expectations, said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, to the news.
People say they're already on a high level, which is true.
Women in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailed her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court nominee, analysts are hinting that there could be a backlash if the Republicans continue with the confirmation.
It's a real mess for the Big Old Party, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the bench, but also about the way Republicans approached it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news.

38% thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same for Ford.
Flake's pressures have led the FBI to investigate the allegations made by Ford, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party during his time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to take over Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is world domination.
We have to do it now, he said thinking about the startup.
This is a historic moment
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal network data storage or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about personal online storage is that the decision about who can access what information is entirely up to the users.
The company calls this "personal data empowerment".
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the resources, processes and skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, a few engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world were able to build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to make a complete change in which all their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
We don't ask for their permission
Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
1994: Berners-Lee revolutionizes the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
even as long as he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the awarding of the Victoria Cross to a World War I priest
Celebration in honour of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I fighter
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
4 days later, he was shot by a sniper and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
one of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "incredibly symbolic that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the feat of his grandfather for which he was given this recognition.
According to the official London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St Quentin Canalthrough very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and engine rooms.

Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's achievements were something that he knew I could never achieve, and that inspires humility.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be in the parade and added that the "courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give".
The mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got Piglet Pepp.
Imagine this: You stay up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches only to end up being unable to follow the main event.
San Jose featured 13 fights, including six on the main roster, and in the UK, they were shown live on Channel 5 at night.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, UK viewers were left in shock when the broadcast was interrupted by Pepper's Fever.
Many were not impressed after being kept up until the early hours of the morning just for the fight.

"Under state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to move it to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Yup, 'Pork Peppa' is the name of the song.
Bellator president Scott Coker has stated that he will align his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
When I consider re-enacting, I think we can probably work something out, said Coker.

But we're working on it.
trust me, when the transmission was cut off, there was a lot of correspondence circulating that wasn't even friendly.
Trying to fix it, thought it was a technical problem.
It's a problem of a national nature.
I can promise you that next time, it won't be.
                                                                                                                                                                                                 
It was an unfortunate circumstance.
Tom Daley felt inferior when it came to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize that "everyone is like me" until he started high school.
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he speaks about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that winning the Olympics has become less important to him since he became a father.
The longtime host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off work due to illness.

The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT advocate and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said it was surprising that he fell in love with a man                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference never was a problem for him.
️When you're so young you go through so much̶ he looked back on his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later he said it's hard to find someone his age who hasn't experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his all perspective had changed.

You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my gold medalist.

Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was did they get tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to be first in line.
I couldn't tell him: Dad, you're not gonna be here long enough to be in the front row, he said.
I held his hand as he exhaled, and only when he stopped breathing and died, did I finally become aware that he was not invincible, he said.

Mickelson off the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson, USA, will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to fully recover to avoid an unfortunate turning point.
Mickelson, who is playing in this biennial tournament for a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-quarter games.
n't be in the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and working out his game in the gym in the hope of fixing what was bothering him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding terrain of Le Golf National, where a long, uneven course routinely punishes inaccurate shots.
And if the field isn't scary enough, Mickelson is up against the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has won all four matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are 12 games out, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man
He completely understood the role he had today, he patted me on the back, he hugged me and he said he would be ready tomorrow, said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence
He's a celebrity and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's what happened, and we felt that's what we should do.
He wants to be on the field, like everybody else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 half-times, although Furyk said his presence has also brought certain intangible values to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for the team, he explained.
I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than the game.
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big advantage on the final day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
Danish made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, where the team of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended in their victory by a narrow margin of 141⁄2 ̶ 131⁄2.
Sempre te recuerdan que tuvimos una gran ventaja en Valderrama; tuvimos una gran ventaja en Brooklyn, donde perdimos, y en Valderrama, donde ganamos, pero con una estrecha diferencia, dijo Bjorn, en la foto, después de observar al equipo de 2018 que ganó por 5 ̶ 3 el viernes y ayer lideró por 10 ̶ 6 en el campo de Le Golf National.
i, history will show me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
tomorrow you'll be playing at full power.
Get out there and do it right.
Nothing's over till the floor is announced.
Triple-A-Triple.Triple-A-Triple.Triple-A-Triple.Triple-A-Triple.Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-A-Triple-Triple-A-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-Triple-T
I'm always talking, focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who is up against us the greatest players in the world
"I would never run in front of a rope in this", he added.
Tomorrow, we'll face a different beast.
Tomorrow is the main singles, and that's something completely different.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
e message is to get to the players, and that is to give their best tomorrow.
Now leave your teammate because he has to give his best.
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the other side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk was on both ends of the big turnaround last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as the loser after Europa performed the "miracle" in Medina.
I remember every damn word, he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, cheered up his players before the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this rush moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
"We've organized our lineup and we've arranged the guys as if we're, you know, trying to perform magic tomorrow".
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main bout, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the top half.

                                                                                                                                                                                            
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but won't be ready until at least next year due to malfunctioning systems and rising costs, local media reported.
Rheinland-Pfalz, flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reports, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
It should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years without returning to home ports.

The F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.

The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half as many as on the older Bremen class frigates.
also proved to be dramatically overweight, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz of 7000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project including crew training also becomes a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) ̶ up from the initial €2.2 billion.
problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's committee for defence, admitted that the navy actually has no ships capable of deployment.
The official said that the problem increased over time, as the old ships were decommissioned and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
National Trust ea ea ea ea ea ea
New research being carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), will follow common and swamp bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and river bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special cameras will be set up at key locations around the holdings to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile searches using handheld detectors.
An analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what species are doing.
Then a habitat map and report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council should be consulted on the implementation of the European Forestry Agency's (EFSA) 's (EU) 2015/1247 recommendations.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelter and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can mosquito nets and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and pet cat attacks.
Bates are not actually blind.

They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ten trained experts regularly conduct surveys, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat sanctuary in Scotland on Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager, says the estate is the ideal area for them.
"Here in Threave we have a huge bat room", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good housing.
"However, there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to thrive".
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, as accidental destruction of a single litter can kill up to 400 females and juveniles, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bates are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative for the Scottish Bat Conservation Society, has urged the public to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are progressing".

Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was fearful of retribution and worried that she would be publicly humiliated.

Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million move.
UK will forever regret losing carmakers
UK will regret foreverif after Brexit it loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer, said UK business secretary Greg Clark.
worrying that Toyota UK told the BBC that, should the UK leave the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Burnstone, near Derby.
We need a deal, said Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of waiting at the borders in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Myself is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will experience production stoppages at our factory, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnston.
The UK car makers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal due to the possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is saying that they're closing their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

UK leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March could lead to a border disruption which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota couldn't keep more than what it needed for a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would be halted.
Chequers plan proposed by Theresa May for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.
We need to reach an agreement.We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but to take advantage of this opportunityhe told BBC Radio 4 today.
Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are showing that we absolutely must be able to continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota couldn't say how long they might be shut down, but they warned that in the long run, the extra costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Trump's Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "deferred for another week" as the fight continues for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a rumour in Washington for months.

Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't like" firing Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the Kavanaugh lawsuits
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.

I always like to report everything to the press.
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10th.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to dislike for the theatrical behaviour of television reporters, although she said:I will not oppose the fact that they are messing around.
She then hinted at increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president is holding more meetings to answer questions than any president before him, she said, adding without citing evidence:We have analyzed the numbers.
The briefings will continue to happen, Sanders said,
We try to make this happen often, and you've seen this in the last few weeks, and it's just that you can talk to the president of the United States and it's going to replace brief press conferences.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.

This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of a gathering of journalists.
The Minister for Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The Minister for Health has sent a letter to the EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.

Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery following a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
He got to the line of scrimmage and just crashed, said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and sending him for further tests.
A representative from Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there are no details on the type/size of the injury and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, is playing his first season for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shots before being out of the game, bringing his total to 18 shots in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee for buying property in the UK
Torres' new plans will charge foreign buyers a higher fee for buying UK property, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year for homeless relief.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee for buying property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to lure young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and target those with high wages.
The tax increase will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will contribute to the Government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee that is added to the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago on other homes and real estate purchased for issuance may be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to fit in with the homeowners' society.

The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking but not exploiting the land, and called upon Mrs May to give up her quota on affordable housing to remedy the shame of the housing situation in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to zero-triggered evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
last year I said that I would dedicate my term of office to renewing the British dream that the lives of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is not right, however, that non-UK residents, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as UK residents.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for many people, and the shame of homelessness remains very real.

Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul DiCanio.
ex-chef do Alloa Athletica diz que não sentia medo porque herda nomes tão famosos num grande clube, depois de ter rejeitado convites para o Barnsley e o Ipswich Town.
Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
"The club is unquestionably a Premier League club, because of its structure and content", he said.
It's not easy getting there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there
Ross is in his third year as manager, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from relegation to the third tier and led St Mirren from relegation to the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than he has ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, remembering the takeover of Alloe.
I really believed that managing was what I was good at, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making a solid income, and enjoying some pretty successful moments.
t game can be hard.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it.

The summer heat wave raised revenues for British pubs, who were struggling financially, but added pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in revenue in July, but restaurant revenue declined by 4.8 percent.
Continuing good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July would be similar to the previous June, when pub revenues rose by 2.8%, with restaurants now being hit even more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant revenue in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are served have made much higher profits on equal terms compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where the food is mainly served also suffered from the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurants.

"Bars and pubs grew their drinks sales by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales fell by 3 percent".
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst, said:
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% drop in sales per annum will be particularly painful because of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a better time for the restaurant managers, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed respite.
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the growth of the brand share.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry sales tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and establishes an industry benchmark.
1 in 5 children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents

A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content
20% of the students said they had a main account that they showed their parents.
1 in 5 children, some as young as 11 years old, have secret social network accounts that they hide from adults.

The news has reinforced the fear of publishing sexual content.
20% of the students said they use a cleaned up  main account to show their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One mother who found a secret Web site for her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged her with the words "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), revealed that 40% of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
"It's worrying that many teens are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athlete" in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated female athlete in Scotland, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to tap into her vast experience gained internationally over the past decade.
Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from having him on the board, said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the sport and I hope I can really contribute to sport in Scotland".

The company that produces the cheaters with its ad comparing nursing mothers to cows that arouse husbands has divided opinion on the Internet.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be the world's first silent wearable cheater, Elvie's consumer technology company has released an ad inspired by a tongue-in-cheek music video to showcase the freedom that new cheaters give mothers.
Four mothers dancing in a barn full of hay and cows to music whose lyrics read:Yes, I husband myself, but you don't see any tailIn case you haven't noticed, these are not whim, these are my breasts
"Pump, pump, I feed the baby with it, pump, pump, my ladies' husband".

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except they steal their babies a few days after birth, wrote one person.
Elvie the traitor discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
"Understandably traumatic for mother and child".
Why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who can keep their babies?
"Absolutely pointless advertising".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "laughable".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
if I was breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The commercial is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it is.
"This is a brilliant product", she said.
This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who give milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like a cow.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with discreet cheaters in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who deliver milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's traitor, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go outside during the breastfeeding.
Elvie's Delivery is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.

Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves and they were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping out and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in immigration and customs, testified in front of congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsoring household in the country are illegal, and a large number of them are criminal clients.
, said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter workers, in order to speed up proceedings for the children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, instead of after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video conference call, not in person, to present their case for legal status in immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports that have surfaced from the system in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
The advocates said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is highly likely that signs of child abuse will be ignored.
They add that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say hello to friends can cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish  occupation forces to withdraw immediately


Them must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where since 2011 over 360,000 people have died, while millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to fight in this holy battle
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mostly training and advising both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.

We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity for resuming political negotiations.
Russia-Turkey deal prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a region where 3 million people live.

UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to a revision of the articles of the current constitution and warned against interference.

t is not surprising that the 17th district of pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to congressional redistricting that has resulted in two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently reorganized suburban district of Pittsburgh is highlighted by Democrat Conor Lamb who last spring won the seat in the 2nd District in a special election.
Lamb is running against the other incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which overlaps greatly with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally redrawn in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District has triggered a campaign finance battle between the party's main fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Convention Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republican has held that position for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political analysts gave a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. is considering whether to sanction El Salvador for providing support to China, and then back down.
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.

Officials from the State Department have decided to call in the US diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan, said spokeswoman Heather Nauert.

The proposed penalties, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high rates of unemployment and homicides.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to proceed with a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.

Vice President Mike Pence is expected to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on details of the discussion described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also wished to remain anonymous.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about facing the Vienna Rapids
Rangers are Thursday home to Rapida de Viña, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
Knee injury prevented teammate Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2 - 2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something done and we pulled a point.
e, in the end, we might have stolen the game, but, in general, the tie is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.

Women can't sleep for fear of retirement savings
Though the study participants had a clear idea of the type of care they wanted, few people discussed it with their family members.

Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, suspected in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people  a rare execution for a federal crime not carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side of Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who crossed his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
both of these points lead to a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury struck down a 22-count indictment for Saipov that included eight counts of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requiredconsiderable planning and forethought, the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried itas disgusting, cruel and depraved.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucca, the notice of intent states.
5 of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in the electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Saipov told authorities that after watching ISIS videos on his phone he was inspired to carry out the attack, the indictment states.

He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were clearly disappointed
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved, Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has pledged to "mobilize the people's army"
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to feel the pressure of Eurosceptics since one of the MPs, Therese May, had suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have 'come out' by now if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan in the midst of the attacks from the Brexiteers, the Remainers and the EU.

Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave campaign meeting in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of the Chequers.
e propeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Had he been in charge, we'd have been out by now, he said.
I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out the Chequers.
We didn't fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.
Conservative and pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the march, addressing reporters with the words:I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers Plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.
Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they deliver on their promises
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be made to "feel the pressure" if they are going to fail the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
It's now a question of trust between usthe peopleand our political classes, he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'that won't go away for you'.

We mobilize the people's army of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
n the meantime, the remainder supporters have marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.

The Labour Party, Lord Adonis, has been making fun of the Conservatives for the security issues they've suffered with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
Themes people telling us they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus plan, for unimpeded border, for borderless free trade in Ireland, he added.
It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit, he added.

From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton to go into traffic at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that reluctantly left the Ferrari driver free to the danger of being held back after a double move in the third corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he relied on his tyres to get to the fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally made it to the pits on lap 44, but failed to pick up his pace for the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
Twas a tough day because Valtteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
"The team did a really great job in getting to the formation finish", said Hamilton.
It was very bad body language

The only thing that can happen and the only beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and nasty and dishonest, he said.
When you look at the publicity and the leaks, and then they say,Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public?
Ah, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to.
No, I didn't.

"I didn't withhold Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't release her story to the public", Feinstein told the board, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for.

"I never saw worse body language in my life".
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
They are determined to regain power at any cost.
See the evil, the ugliness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get to power and control, are the words of the president, Mediaite reports.

Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.

Air Niugini now says one man is listed as missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that owns the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims one man is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their efforts to locate the person in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.

Officials said Friday that seven people have been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
Airline and US Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to break through the water that sucked up to their waist to the exit in case of danger of a sinking plane.

The US Navy stated that sailors working nearby repairing the harbor also helped in the rescue by using a inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 100 feet of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG registered air carriers in the last two decades, but that none of these have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst's running a time-lapse on the night the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors concluded Saturday
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the US Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cellphone data to piece together a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which contradicts his previous claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
n data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's at the time he was allegedly with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and stated that he was out of town that day.
When asked by the prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records indicated that they'd known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, at some point after Chambers' death, erased her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
He wiped her out of his life, stated Hale.
The defense should begin closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.

Another black woman?!
New York City nanny sues couple for firing after  racist message
New York City nanny sues couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "once again a black woman".
The couple denies being racist, comparing the charge to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when upon arrival on her first working day in 2016 she learned that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
NEEEE ENGINE NEGRATOR, was written by Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
,,,,...
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an "accidental" situation, and fired Ms. Maurice, because, she claims, their then-former nanny, who was African American, was doing her job poorly, and she was expecting the Philippines instead, reports the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then went home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for severance pay and is seeking $350 a day for the six months she was originally employed, albeit without a contract.
I want to show them that they can't do such things, she told the Post on Friday, adding:I know it's discrimination.
The couple responded to claims that they were racist, saying that terminating Mauric's employment was a reasonable thing to do, for fear that she might be insulted and not be trusted later.
My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racists", said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
Actually, would you trust your children to a person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Plasco said his wife had only been given two months of maternity leave after the baby was born and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
You'll sue someone who's in that situation
"That's not very nice", added the investment banker.

Paddington's publishers were afraid readers wouldn't identify with the talking bear, revealed in the new letter
It's hard before publication to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's going to read the book for the first time.
It's funny what we know now about Paddington's huge success.
told her father,who worked as a BBC cameraman before a little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.
He was quite a quiet man and was not a boastful one, she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was perceived as some kind of achievement of your own child: you were proud of him even though none of it was actually your doing.
I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
"Even though it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington alone".

Message from a grieving woman on a bridge to prevent suicides
2 women who lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day, she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a chef with an infectious smile who was looking forward to a brilliant career.
Everybody remembered him by his smile.
"Sempre se decía que su sonrisa podía llenar de alegría a cualquier habitación".
though, before he died, he quit his job because he was in a real dark state.

Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
He didn't say he was feeling sad, depressed or anything like that, she said.
Days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was on the bottom
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to get over it:It leaves a huge hole in the family.
Thick us.


Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
I thought maybe we could bring in a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he was asking for
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
their reluctance was prompted by the choice of moment.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6
George W. Bush is constantly calling on senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes their report?
The Senate, currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.

Mr. Park said that the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more fees that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Koreans eventually became South Korean citizens.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South which are still technically at war have improved considerably in recent months.

This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a broader sense to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it is not considered that under such circumstances we disarm first, said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that because of his temperament he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview
I couldn't help but think that a woman, if she ever behaved like that, would be called "hysterical", she described to Pelosi her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional during his opening statement, occasionally almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the board, calling the accusations against hima "grotesque and coordinated smear campaign" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he couldn't participate in the Supreme Court's work, because he showed he had prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats", she said.

I'll say thisif he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court he's on now, Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she's concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from Roe v. Wade, because she's considered a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh, in his confirmation hearings, has bypassed questions about whether he will reverse any Supreme Court decisions.
Not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say,"Isn't that wonderful", said Pelosi.
women have to deal with.
justified criticism, anger that has been building up for months and years  all of this can't be gotten rid of without crying.
We cry when we're angry, Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?

One of my fondest memories of my first job, in a male-dominated office, is that one time, I was crying with unspeakable rage, and an older woman  a cold manager who I always was a little bit afraid of  dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh 30 years later.

Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".

How a US-China trade war might be good for Beijing
The start of the US-China trade war has been loud and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump,
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products, actually taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to hit the US with a blow, and the second largest economy in the world is certainly not going to give up anytime soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by yielding to demands, but public submission to the US would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, President of China.
China
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to trigger an economic meltdown in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed", said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow for strategic thinking focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready for refugee return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.

Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to restore normalcy.
now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were directed at their daily life and existence are met.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help in rebuilding the devastated country.

Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 × 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
USA have lost six times in a row on European soil and haven't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europa once again took the crown as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, on the 16th hole par 3, sent the ball into the water on the first stroke, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and become one of only 4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth, the American, was sent off by Thorbjorn Olesen, the Danish, the lowest ranked player in the European team, with 5 and 4.
World's best player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
8 Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia has become the European with the most victories in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"Normally I don't cry, but today I can't stop crying".
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
So happy, so happy to win the cup again.
"I'm happy to have been able to help", said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He is passing the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who in Sunday's singles match, defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1.
I feel incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play, said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is just behind Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the entire weekend trying to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, the US captain Jim Furyk said:
At times, we have resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta take your hat off to people.
We're out of business.
New data on red tide: concentrations decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in the concentration of red tide in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, conditions of heterogeneous algal blooms are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties which indicates a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide runs for about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The flowering area can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.

The last week has seen moderate concentrations in Pinellas County or its coastal area, low to high concentrations in Hillsborough County or its coastal area, common to high concentrations in Manatee County, common to high concentrations in Sarasota County or its coastal area, common to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in Lee County or its coastal area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
