This is the seventh incident in recent days.
Renewal and valid driving licence (DL) photos of those who have been photographed by September 30 are ready, the rest of the licenses will be available next week.
This notice has been posted on the delivery counter of DTO Office.
It is clear that the DTO Office itself is assuming that DLs are being delivered after a month, while the deadline in the Right to Service Act is set at seven days.
This means that DTO Office must prepare a DL and submit it to the applicant within seven days of application.
The situation is much worse in terms of ground reality.
There are also many applicants who have not been able to get their DL delivered even after 9 months.
The number of applicants who have been circling for two months is countless.
The deteriorating condition of the office can be estimated from the fact that the notice on the delivery counter is not yet known to DTO Anil Garg.
He claims that the DLs are being delivered within the stipulated time limit.
Then he took notice and the answer was that he had no knowledge of it.

This fact has been revealed by the Environmental Protection Board's investigation.
The sound pollution was up to 100 decibels in the scans conducted at some places on Diwali last year.
On normal days, this figure is 55 decibels.
Every year, noise pollution from fireworks or DJ noise is steadily increasing.
Even after the regime 's ban, over - standard decibel fireworks are sold and even burned.
The SDM of the respective sector has the right to prevent them, but they also avoid their responsibility in time.
Environmental Protection Board had measured noise pollution near traffic post during Diwali last year.
Diwali was celebrated on 10th November at two different times.
The minimum noise pollution was found to be 72.5 and the maximum 83.6.
Similarly, on Diwali day 13 November 2012, the maximum noise pollution was found to be 87.7 decibels and the minimum was 80 decibels.
During Diwali, a maximum of 100.3 decibels of noise pollution was detected, while the minimum noise pollution was 72.1 decibels.
The maximum noise pollution was found to be 65 decibels and the minimum 55 decibels on normal days.
On Diwali, most people do not pay attention and use loud fireworks.

The sluggish demand for gold bars and coins was affected by the inflation and weak economic scenario.
In Delhi, the price of gold is Rs 31,400 per 10 gram which was Rs 32,485 per 10 gram on Dhanteras last year.
"The weak economic scenario and inflation have led to a huge drop in demand for gold", said Haresh Soni, Chairman of the All India James and Jewelry Federation.
Chairman of Geetanjali Group and MD Mehul Chocci said that the total gold sales are down by 25 per cent.
The attitude of buyers has changed.
We expect diamond sales to be 25 per cent higher this year than last year.
Despite the lower prices of gold this year than last year, people are buying silver on this money - tether.
The head of the Panhas meets arbitrarily.
Making a number of similar allegations, Bengabad 's Pansas Ram Prasad Yadav has applied to the District Panchayati Raj Padashi to release the Chief from office and take action against the Secretary.
He said that on July 4 the Chief and the Secretary had complained to the Panchayati Raj Padasakhs, which led to their suspension by the Chief.
He has also given proof to the Panchayati Raj Padashi of irregularities being carried out by the Chief.
He said that all the Pansas should be notified by sending a notice seven days before the general meeting of the Pansas, but the Head of the Pansas informed the meeting on May 12 on May 8, which the Pansas received a day before.
The Secretary of the Panchayat did not inform the Panchayat Committee-level Official of the meeting on 3 July, which prevented the Official from attending the meeting.

Jagaran, Jammu: When sin is rampant on earth and people of demonic inclination are oppressing the people, God has to descend to destroy the wicked.
Lord Krishna was born to liberate the people of Mathura from the atrocities of the Kansa.
In the Shrimad Bhagavat week, which started with the wishes of peace on the Indo - Pak border in Lallel Satwari, Mahat Nanda Kishore (Gao Manasawale) narrated the story of the descent of Lord Krishna to Sangat on Wednesday.

The Mahatma said that the mind should not be moved by lowliness and should be devoted to the Lord.
The only remembrance of God frees man from suffering.
He said Pakistan has a low sense of India which is forcing it to go down the wrong path again and again.
He must understand that his actions are only harming the common people living on both sides of the border.
Hundreds of devotees made sacrifices in the Havan conducted to wish peace on the frontier before the story.

Every individual in society has to step forward to tackle this problem, because corruption has taken root so deeply that it is not possible for the government alone to overthrow it.
The common man has to come forward.

A fire broke out in a fireworks shop at Dehradun Road.
It was a pleasure to see that the fire was contained in time.
Umesh Singh had set up a fireworks shop outside his hotel near the Durga temple on Dehradun Road.
At about 8.30 pm, a rocket suddenly hit the fireworks counter.
The counter of fireworks caught fire and the entire shop burned with explosions.

Apart from South India, the film is often praised in cinemas in Singapore and Malaysia.
The actress is called "Avani Modi".
Avani is from Gujarat district of Gandhinagar.
Avani had a passion for acting from childhood, but she had not been able to set foot in acting until college.
This led to the fact that the college script writer had once told Avani that acting is too far away, you don 't even get the idea of acting.
Missing in the crowd of students in schools and colleges, Avani is now playing Gujarat's punch in the Tamil film industry.
However, it was later revealed after the landlord came in that the teenager was his relative.
The householders had gone to the market so they left the girl at home and left the door closed.
The teenager 's family was summoned and handed over to him in the presence of the council and police.
The fourteen year old daughter of her relative, Soni Devi, came from Girdhi to Sushil Vishwakarma 's house.

The neighbors also fled.
The surrounding people immediately reported the incident to the police.
The counsellor Anup Sawa arrived.
By then, Anjali had arrived.

The announcement of the candidates for the three seats is stuck.

It should be noted that candidates for all seats except the former assembly are currently MLAs from the respective constituencies.
Only Anchal Sonkar has been a former MLA from the former constituency.
The names of the candidates of the parties were announced and the field workers were delighted.

However, officials have not said that there is any rock found in the excavation at this time.
The Shovhan Government said that the rock was found and the truth of the treasure will be revealed to the ASI officials as soon as they break it.
The Shovhan government has repeatedly expressed anger and backed down from his statement.
He once said that if the operation had been carried out by the army, the truth would have been revealed by now.
But at one point he shocked everyone by saying that gold would not come out until he was called to the excavation site.
When questioned about the constant variation in the matter, the government began to bluntly accuse ASI and the administration and said that what such work is being done at the excavation site that the media is being banned.
We demanded a live broadcast of the excavation.
He must admit that the ASI team is digging at the place where he was told.
However, after a day's rest, the ASI team resumed the excavation work today but could not go further by a centimetre.
Deputy District Magistrate Vijay Shankar Dube said that the ASI team has been cleaning 4m 80cm of excavation so far throughout the day.
If the Tata Workers Union cannot find a permanent solution to the issue of Quarter Extension of Tata Steel employees, the Secretary-General should announce the date of convening the Requisition Meeting as soon as possible.
If the grade revision agreement is delayed, an attempt should be made to provide interim allowance to the employees.
About ten Union committee members who applied for the requisition on Friday evening met with Secretary General BK Dinda on these two demands.
During the conversation, Dinda said that no talks could be held between management and union on the issue of extension on Friday.
The matter will be considered by convening an Office Bearer Meeting on Saturday.
The delegation to meet the Secretary-General included Ghulam Moinuddin, Manjit Singh, Saroj Pandey, Mahendra Singh, Dharmendra Upadaya, Lal Bahadur Upadaya, Ravi Shankar Pandey, Muneshwar Pandey and Girish.

Prakash Padhavi Diwali has started today.
Friday is the day of the little Diwali, or Dhanteras.
The beautiful rangolians are also a delight in the home decorations of Diwali.
Beautiful colors made outside or in the courtyard add to the beauty of the house.

You can also enhance the beauty of your home by making these beautiful rangoli.
These officers were already promoted to the Joint Secretary and the current post was upgraded to the Joint Secretary level.
Informing of the action taken on the petition filed in the High Court on the over-increase in fees by Deepak Verma and others of Nagal, Advocate Dhera Chawla said that the Honourable High Court's notice has been received from Advocate Kuldeep Tiwari of BBMB.
The date of 12 November has been set for the reply to the notice.
It is worth mentioning that two years later, the school of BBMB had increased the fees of non-BBMB students last month.
The parents have knocked on the door of the Hon. High Court.
Two years ago, parents demonstrated in the streets to protest the fee increase, after which the fees were slightly reduced.
This time again, the increase in fees caused anger among parents.
The sudden increase in fees has brought the parents to the rescue five months after the start of the new session.
The parents protested the school manager 's move for several days after holding meetings.
Despite this, the parents have finally knocked on the door of the High Court because the school management did not listen.
Parents say that it is not appropriate to increase the fees over and over again.
This has a negative impact on the education of children and their business.
The Chief said that development work needs to be carried forward with transparency in government work.
He said that any irregularity in the implementation of the plans will not be tolerated.

The BEO was asked for a list of school buildings under construction in the block.
In the absence of the Department of Health and CDPO, the delegates were not allowed to sit in the auditorium.

During the meeting, various departments including the Department of Supply, Drinking Water Sanitation, Health were reviewed.
MP Representative Prof. Praveen Chaudhary said that the Department of Cooperation would provide funds to the beneficiaries of the Green Revolution so that farmers can move forward.
He emphasized the high level of scrutiny of the work of the Department of Cooperation.
Hitler wrote in his autobiography, Mein Kampf, that the shape of a lie is the main reason for trust.
People accept the big lies more easily than the small lies in the primal simplicity of their minds.
In the emergency, Congress leader Devant Barua had proposed the principle of 'Indira is India'.
But the facts of history are different.
Nation building has a proud history.
It is the people of India who have given the nation a world reputation through their conscious work.
And for the philosophy, the Vedic ancestors like Rishi, Kapil, Buddha, Mahavira and Shankaracharya are remarkable.
For the ancient national unity there are the dynasties of Chandragupta Maurya, Ashoka etc.
There is a great series of great men who have been confronted by foreign attacks and rulers.
There is a long list of immortal martyrs like Vivekananda, Dayananda, Tilak, Gandhi, Subhas, Patel, Lohia, Vipin Chandra, Ambedkar etc. with Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad, but the entire credit for nation building is being given to the Nehru - Indira family.
A big lie is more effective.
16 of the 58 Union Schemes are named after Rajiv Gandhi.
The list of other schemes, awards, airports and institutions belonging to the Nehru family is long.
Now the scheme of public distribution system, i.e. PDS, is also being prepared to be linked to the name of Indira Gandhi.
The names of the great men inspire.
The identification of roads, universities or airports in their name is of course welcome, but the naming of the international airport in the capital of the country, from the Rural Housing Scheme to the name of the same political family, cannot be considered appropriate in any form.
The public distribution system is already badly known.
Who is stopping Congress from seeking votes in the name of this scheme?
But what is the difficulty of taking a look outside the Nehru family at the time of naming?
There was a competitive argument between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the main opposition party, the Prime Minister's candidate Narendra Modi, over the greatness of Sardar Patel.
Patel is a great nation maker.
He had connected 562 state units to the nation through his device.
Patel is dear to all, dear to all of India, but the Congress considers him only its property.
The public distribution system can also be named after Patel.
This will not make any difference to the importance of Patel.
Congress has been in power for a long time.
The plans were politicized by the Congress.
Once a democratic party, Congress was led by democratic leaders like Tilak, Gokhale, Gandhi, Subhas, Rajendra Prasad, Nehru, Patel and Madan Mohan Malviya. After 1950 it passed under the control of a family.
Party and family became synonymous.
The slogan of 'Indira is India' was used to synonymous family and country.
The naming of the schemes also became a domestic issue.
Government schemes are run from the treasury collected from the taxpayers of the country.
The treasury of the country is not the property of a single family of Congress.
Every party in the Congress has made its own great men.
Regional parties have been running schemes in the name of mind - controlled politicians.
The great men are of all, but the list of the great men of the party grew.
Every small and large party has its own great men.
In the US, government schemes are not run in the name of politicians.
In India, their justification is pathetic.
The Centre claims to take direct credit for running the scheme in the name of the Nehru family.
Schemes named after Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose or Bhagat Singh are not associated with the identity of the Congress.
Congress has been cut off from its legacy.
The message or preaching of Rahul Sonia is the work of Congress.
Of course, even if other parties name their plans the same way, they do not run them under the same family name as the Congress.
The politicization of social welfare schemes is reprehensible.
The laptop distributed in Uttar Pradesh has pictures of the SP chief.
Of course, voters give the majority party the right to formulate policies.
The Government is bound by the duties of planning and implementation, but voters and taxpayers do not give the Government the right to name the schemes as they please.
Voters expect governments to be good governance, not politics, and taxpayers to make transparent and proper use of the treasury.
Political misuse of the treasury is a constitutional crime.
A code of ethics for naming must be developed.
Politicians are not the cure for every merger.
India is full of multi - dimensional talent.
The name of the higher education institution/research institution should be after a talented Indian scientist.
It would be nice to name an institution related to literature, philosophy or arts after a distinguished literary or philosophical figure.
Politics lacks a sense of history.
The name of the country was also discussed at the Constituent Assembly.
Seth Govinddas, Kamlapati Tripathi etc. emphasized the 'India'.
India got 38 votes and India 51 votes.
The fundamental question is why not take a deep look at the naming of the plans?
Why is politics so much about this?
Why is the same family so important?
Why not make a list of common names?
Joint committees of Parliament or Legislative Assembly may also be used to make the list.
Why is there such chaos at both the Central and State levels in the naming of schemes?
This chaos has led the young generation to forget the names of freedom fighters.
There are great men of all kinds.
Some of them are fake TVs and mostly political biases.
Naming is knowledgeable.
The name given in Rigveda 's 'Gyanasukta ' is the beginning of knowledge.
Good naming of plans is also motivating.
Recalling the names of great personalities from the Book of Common Knowledge is a labour of labour, but linking a government scheme, road or important site to a motivating figure can be the simplest tool for awakening the awareness of history.
Many names like Gandhi Nagar, Patel Airport, Ambedkarpuram or Vivekanandpuram connect to inspiring history.
A survey conducted two to three months ago showed that half of the country's villages were linked to Ram.
Naming requires an additional awareness of country, era, culture, civilization and history.
Many names are representative of special feelings and attitudes.
The names of Dayanand, Vivekanand and Gandhi are synonymous with social change, Vedanta philosophy and truth, nonviolence respectively.
The Congressman urges friends to come out of the habit of finding names in the same family.
There are many names in the history of India that have a golden character.
The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Tribunal has ordered compensation of Rs 50.67 lakh to the family of former Maharashtra Minister Shri K.
The family had demanded Rs 25.82 crore in compensation.
The family said that the negligence of the bus driver of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) was the cause of Zichkar 's death on 2 June 2004.
The Tribunal also ordered MSRTC to pay compensation, saying that the insurance company will not have to pay any amount because the car was stolen by itself.
The family of Zichkar's lecturer friend Shri Ram Dhawar will also receive Rs 21.60 lakh compensation.
He also passed away in the same accident.
About 70 per cent of this amount (Rs 15.12 lakh) will be given by MSRTC.
The remaining 30 per cent (Rs 6.48 lakh) will be given to the family of the former minister as the car driver of the Zichkar is also found guilty of negligence.
He discussed organizational activities with the party supporters and members.

This time, the people of Twin Cities may have to celebrate Diwali in the dark.
who have not paid the electricity bill on the due date.
Connections are being cut after 15 days of the scheduled date.
Hundreds of connections have been cut off from all the divisions of the camp, number one, two and Babal.
This is why the number of consumers who cut off the connection of electricity offices is increasing.
Consumers are upset.
One of the reasons for the problem is that the Power Corporation has also stopped taking part payments.
If the corporation is taking part payment, then consumers are having to pay 80 to 90 per cent of the bill.
In Sub Division One, SDO has issued a notice to the office saying 'Do not be ashamed of making a partial payment'.
In terms of SE of Operation Circle Ambala, the Power Corporation has left the concept of compassion on consumers.
Now they have to pay the next two months bill within the due date or the electricity connection will be cut after 15 days of the last date of payment of the bill.
Ambala Circle has received a target of Rs 102 crore from North Haryana Power Distribution Corporation.
Therefore, all the divisions of XEN and SDO have been ordered to complete this target.
October 31 was the last date for this target which could not be completed.
The government on Friday lowered the import duty price of gold to $440 per 10 g and increased the import duty price of silver to $738 per kg.
The changes have been made in view of the fluctuations in the value of both precious metals.
Import duty on precious metals is levied on the price.
The import duty price of gold was raised to $ 442 per 10 g two days earlier, while the duty price of silver was then kept at $ 699 per kg.
Generally, each of the five precious metals is reviewed in the duty price, but due to volatility in the Vaishrivik market, the duty price was changed.
According to an official statement, the Central Board of Customs and Excise has issued notification in this regard.
The duty price of copper scrap in addition to precious metals was reduced to $3,840 per tonne from yesterday's $3,933 per tonne.
On the other hand, imported vegetable oils such as raw soybean oil, RBD palm oil and others have been increased in duty prices.
