This not only confirms the already well-known theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that are generally lacking in fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists have discovered that the upper part of this feather was purple and the lower part was pale or yellow.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs didn't have a well-developed flag called an axis, but they had other characteristic feathers like a spider and small fins, and researchers speculated that these other characteristics evolved later into an axis.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used for temperature control or for demonstration, rather than as flying dragon. The researchers examined the samples from the tail of young dinosaurs and said that they were the feathers of an adult dinosaur, not the feathers of a baby.
This is the tail of a young dinosaur, but the researchers say that if you look at the sample, you can tell that it's a full-grown feather, not a hair of a young animal.

Finally, there are many smaller cats (including untied pet cats) that eat much more small food, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea that every cat has a unique thing that prevents them from competing with other cats, which is to exploit the niche.
The lion is the most social cat and the animal that lives in groups.
The herd consists of one to three related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
The females are very close to each other because they come from large families with many sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave remarkably similarly to lions (but differently from other big cats and animals) similarly to wolves or dogs, which can be extremely deadly to prey.
Tiger is like a versatile athlete, able to climb high, swim, leap long distances, and be pulled five times as strong as a human.

Oselotes prefer small animals, where possible they hunt primates, snakes, rodents and birds that are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that oscillates use smell to hunt and find their prey, by sniffing where they've been.
The oscilotum can see well in the dark, and it's very careful in its movements, and it hunts in a way that covers its prey even when it's melted in its surroundings.

The original population was unchanged, but it still needs the same adaptation.
As time went on, new people started to adapt to new environments, and they started to look different from other people.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years later, the two groups will look so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species, and it's an inevitable outcome and a crucial part of evolution.

In the savannah, it's not easy to fill the amino acid needs of the plants that are available to primates with digestive systems similar to humans.
Plus, failure to do this results in severe growth retardation, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources are leaves, beans, and plant proteins, which are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
The animal foods, such as ants and termites, and eggs, are not only easily digested, but also provide high-quality proteins containing essential amino acids.
"Thus, given all the circumstances, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way that the savanna chimpanzees do today".

The goats are usually herded on hillsides or in wooded areas, often under the care of goat herders, better known as shepherds, who are mostly children or teenagers. This method of herding is still used today.
The Machado was built in England in the early 16th century.
The carriageway was made of parallel wooden planks, but it still allowed the horse to go faster and carry more cargo than the slightly rougher roads of the time.

This became common practice, but iron made the wooden wheels of the chariot more rigid.
Through the years, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and finally in 1767, the railways were introduced, made entirely of iron.
The first known means of transport was walking, and with the appearance of Homo erectus, two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of standing upright.
Sahelantropus may have walked with his legs as early as 7 million years ago, but the best known example of this is in the fossil of Australopithecus, which appeared 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago.

The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methods, which actually drive most scientific research.
The experiment is about eliminating one or more hypotheses, asking questions, observing, and leading to scientific research.
Museologists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.

As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The majority of the rhythms observed in our bodies and behaviors are critically dependent on the existence of productivity and intrinsic cycles through the biological clock.
For most living organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, cyclic rhythms are recorded, not simply as a response to external cyclic signals.
The body clock is a self-sustaining evolver that can sustain itself in a continuous cycle even when no signals are coming from outside.
The Hersh and Chase experiment was one of the first studies to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hush and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant bacteria into their DNA.
They did two experiments to look for DNA in phase when there's a radioactive agent, or a protein in phase when there's radioactive sulfur.
A mutation can have many different effects depending on the type of variant, the importance of the affected genetic material fragment, and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to the offspring, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

This dynamic transport shuttle lets everyone connect to and support a transport system that is self-driving in some way.
Science data now shows that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has helped human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in the community, they use the transportation system, and almost everyone is complaining about the transportation system.

Why is the transport system so unsatisfactory, why is it that every day it fails to deliver, why are the transport engineers so incompetent, or is something more fundamental at work?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study traffic flow because we can't predict the behavior of a driver with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range, so traffic flows have a fair amount of consistency and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent the flow of traffic, we established relationships between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insektos were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings behind their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are bats and flies.

The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes a lot of energy to combine a nucleus with a lot of protons and neutrons.
like rolling a heavy rod up a hill, and if you split the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split themselves with very little outside influence or without any outside conditions.

"Two behaviors can appear when a manager starts to lead an ex-colleague, trying to stay on one end of the spectrum as a "person on staff"."
This type of manager makes decisions that people don't like, disciplines them, assigns them tasks and responsibilities, and has trouble holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become an unconscious individual who thinks that everything the team does should be changed and made in their own way.


Virtual team maintains the same standards of excellence as the existing team, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for real members.
They often have more autonomy than their traditional team members, because they can meet with the changing times that the local management team doesn't understand.
"The existence of a real "transparent team" (Lason and Lapasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
