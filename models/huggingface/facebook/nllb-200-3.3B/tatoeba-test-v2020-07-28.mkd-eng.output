It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That's going to take time.
Why don't you go after him?
It's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I need pedestrians.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom isn't helping me enough.
I'm not going to use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
We were up to our necks in water.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was looking at him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom isn't my father.
Tom is my neighbor.
Tom is already gone.
He probably still has it.
It looked great.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from seven to nine.
Tom returned last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
The nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Wolves were eating the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working here.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are idiots.
Are you happy, Tom?
You ever shoot a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
You got a map for nothing.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're a fool, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this city.
What have they been doing?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston, you know.
They sued the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
How about tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery take place?
Did Tom ask why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is high.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father and is trying to make amends.
Tom doesn't know how to fake it.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love the honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom has a slight frown.
Nobody gives a shit.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would definitely answer.
I have to help him.
He's criticizing himself.
You'll know when the time comes.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit in his mouth.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be cocky with me.
I think you did it.
We're not descended from apes, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything in particular you'd like to see?
What time do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It went on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too much of a jerk for me.
I'll do that, if it's all right with you.
Tom is right.
You're being a little rough.
That sounds like Tom.
No one is judging you.
Stop making a big deal out of Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
Are you helping?
Are you two related?
He wants ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom is obviously an asshole.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat, you know?
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he do his best?
Mary rewinds the film.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do they buy these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can I have that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please, don't whisper.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London. I'm going to the
I won't be alone here.
He asked me to look at it.
We better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Are we really gonna have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know that Tom and Mary had been married before.
Do you want to sing?
You are lucky.
My nose runs every time I catch a cold.
We met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Did anyone else enter the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom was horrible to me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still had a price on it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There's a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We should call for help.
That's what it said in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient and even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd be here.
Just having a little fun.
I was gonna call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human beings.
Don't be a man with a moustache.
She tried herself.
Get out of here!
Is there a delivery charge?
I like turnips.
Why are we meeting here?
Glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one of these, have you?
You'll never hit it.
I think I'll be all right.
Mosquitoes are carriers of malaria.
You've been putting this off too long.
I don't know what you mean.
That's too bad.
Let me tell you something else.
What's the deal with you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We accept checks.
A newsletter costs one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You got one.
Macedonian has four verb forms: pronounced, conditional, ordered, and excelled.
They're still not gone.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenage children.
Tom smiled.
Tom isn't very happy.
Can I have a word with you, Tom?
These pants are perfect for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need a warrant.
We are the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember when I first met the Queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked furious.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
What are you doing up?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I tried to find him.
Our court is great.
It's a game.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll be back at 6:30.
Tom took me to his pussy.
I was only gone for an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
He made a scandal out of standing up.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't draw attention to yourself.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or Taurus?
We're out of gas.
Tom is a troublemaker.
Who do you have on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
The girl saw it too.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What's not to like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't like ice cream.
I think Tom has moved to Boston.
May I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Be careful not to get dirty in the muddy bush.
They both cough.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom is too sensitive.
Mary didn't do the dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Is the price included in the meal?
That would follow.
Do you want to play tennis?
It's going to be okay.
The sauna is here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they'll try to escape.
They all went crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still affirmative.
I'm here to look for her.
Sickness is wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future starts today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was at home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom is gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Tom may be playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How weird!
Is that why you won't help him?
Tom has a room to clean.
There are no survivors.
She should have shut up.
I'm not like you!
 It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.  Then why are you still alive?
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I stuck a shrapnel in him.
Tom isn't alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom didn't answer.
Morality is important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The King found it especially difficult to give speeches because of his severe speech impediment.
She declined the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so worried.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
He licked himself.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
A famous passage from his essay is worth quoting.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list of them.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Go for a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back.
Pull the pin.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made to me.
So you didn't want the reward?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're pleased.
They're not sincere.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to value your health when you're sick.
Look at that star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Get your asses in gear.
Get him to confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Cut it out, Albert. Your theory is a dead end.
We were bankrupt.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
Tom gave it to me.
There's not a drop of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm such a retard.
We've discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
A heater powered the hot ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys were coming down from the trees.
Let's forget about it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You get your data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hi, there, ladies. How are you?
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
I couldn't stand it at first.
His sleeve is stuck.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Shut up !
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everybody left except him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark out there.
The pipes are jammed.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom. I'm not your friend.
Don't you die.
She sat next to him.
Tom is not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom accidentally told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The reporting deadline is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I've examined the situation thoroughly.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's going to help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came up to my knees.
Let's make some cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you'll have to release Tom.
Shame on you!
Don't get too excited.
Sylvia really enjoyed the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom drank from the bottle of wine.
I fell off my bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
Does it bother you?
When does the play start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are ripped.
Tom convinced Mary to donate money.
I have it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you overdid it.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him down!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's your question, Tom.
Tom isn't at all shy.
Tom ran across the railing.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senfov is really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was lovely.
Tom was a good man.
Tom sat next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That was nearly 30 years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom is my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there someone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say "no"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's about to leave.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom is struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
That was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom seriously needs help.
You need to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his arms.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that his previous dentist told him that he could remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Do not expect everyone to share your opinions.
Tom was the one who suggested that.
It just seems wrong.
Tom is a smart guy.
A powdered curry is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a night of pain.
Tom drove through town with his brakes on without noticing.
Yeah, whatever it is.
You want to go camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's going to be there?
We didn't want to cut Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here much longer?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You got it now, right?
I'm pretty bloated right now.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave by now.
People often complain about the unfair treatment of others, failing to see that their own conduct is wrong.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
You want to bowl?
Excuse me, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right about that.
I've been robbed three times a month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I like to exercise.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make such a fuss.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What's that got to do with it?
We meet at last, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up on the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How different you are.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inadequate expressions.
Your coffee gives you energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a great football miracle.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're going to miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom is writing.
Not much like what happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom is really annoyed.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all find her behavior repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Who's line is this?
Avoid her
His eyes were flashing with rage.
Why did you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to put up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran off to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
You'll have to ask him about that.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for that.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
I want to travel. I want to travel.
There are many birds in this forest.
Please let me stay.
Come on, on your feet.
I'm the one Tom wanted to meet.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom may be richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I have no such desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your type.
I'm sorry about that.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicide.
Rattlesnakes, butterflies, and roaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
Which one's yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom scratched his knee.
Where do pianos come from?
Can we talk upstairs for a second?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I see the menu?
He's smart, you know?
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but they failed.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink any soda.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me with this, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really moving.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a turkey with a pan.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so whatever.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking weed.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I feel much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm starving to death.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped suddenly.
My dad used to carry me here when I was young.
What a fool you are.
Put the bottle down.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm committed.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
Always flaunting his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig died.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a mental hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom is packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very useful.
Tom's phone was vibrating.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
You've turned out to be unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't eat his lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They forced him to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be such a wuss.
I can't open this jar.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom changed his mind.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
It's not a high priority.
Take this.
What time is it now?
You know?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not going to make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I will never surrender.
I hope you're up for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
You want to play?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom isn't very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch your back!
Linda had a miscarriage and suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 at the front gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of hurt.
I'll do my job as best I can.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed himself.
Tom threw the arrow.
They're not rocks.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a slutty dress.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get a little more serious.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I will never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
I'm off the clock.
Could you have even helped us?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
He sat by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many large cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that puzzle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom likes us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got a lot of problems.
This is not blue, it's purple.
Who was he with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before they are one year old, and then they are eaten by humans.
Could you pull this arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends money rather than water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't think.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times not to exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on, you know.
The book is heavy.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just saying, be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very bad at muffling sounds, and I can hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We're going to be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find my lock.
Look at us.

I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
We may be related.
I should have called you.
May I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom is fast asleep.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about this!
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen wipes.
I'm safe now.
Strangers look strange to you.
That's why I can't help you.

I believe in miracles.
Get your clothes on.

The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this have happened?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off of me.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded his head.
I can't find the formula.
You're in charge.
I'm thirty years old.
Whoa, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know how to snort?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him
I'll use the dream.
How about a sandwich?
I know what to study.
Pass the appointments.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.

Everybody here loves you very much, Tom.
Today we're gonna eat garlic from Italy.

Come by anytime.
Tom would have kicked us out.

I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's an emergency.
You better get out of here.
Tom slammed the door.
I have two cameras.
What have you got?
Dan confessed to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
That's a drawing of Tom.
The game is not over.
Tom lowered his drink.
My wallet was stolen on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
It must be hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
- Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoeba is a pre-animal.
If you do that to me, I'll slit your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean that Tom is dead.
The wind creates the waves.
Get a clean cup from the closet.
This is not a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French spell their word for "blubber".
The crane can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You look beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
You good for that?
We're pretty good at this.
The pork is diced and fried.
Ask the expert.

I want to get up and dance.
That's kind of nice of you.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom is here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
It's actually kind of boring.
You have a conscience, don't you?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know how Tom got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a sip, your nose is running.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely goes out.
We put up a tent.
I thought it wouldn't rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very handsome, Tom.

Let's find out more about him.
When did this happen?

Slow down, please.

You go out naked like that, you'll catch cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.

I have to fix this.
Where are you going?

I should have been more civilized.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.

Tom probably didn't mean that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her accent.
The teacher is teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece that they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.

When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to speak like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk without a second thought.
Did you buy the medicine?
Has Tom been drinking?
I have a pain in my work.
The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everybody happy?
I thought we could sit here and talk for a while.
Forget about it, all right?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's got me on edge.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was wrong about everything.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom is under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?

He goes to school on foot.
It's starting to come to our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you won't help.
Tom seems very conceited.
Now the question is what do we do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
No more noise.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lives across the street.
I think I can.
Tom is forgetting.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom annoyed Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.

Animals are endangered.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me out to be a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about that.
That can't be true.
Tom is ready.
We have to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were outrageous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so anxious tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We are overreacting.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better after a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come and help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yes, yes, it will be fixed... when the vine bears grapes.
Tom is a consultant.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me an ass.
Since when is there a fireworks?
It's possible that Tom is lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't give anything away.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question that no one has found an answer to, including me, despite 30 years of research into the female soul, is "What do women want?"

Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the rift?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?

Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
Every time we part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you too much for me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's about to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can scan images as well.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
Everybody got up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
What are you guys talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I've got things to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go and find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's just enough air in here.
She married a nobody.
The wind is still.
Nothing has changed.
You don't have to wear anything.
The old man's dying.
I don't feel like reading.
I got lucky with him.
Why would Tom want that?
The sun is one star among billions of others.
I've been watching you.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to beat Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty common.
Did you google it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most parts of the United States.
Well, there's the explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's what I'm talking about.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
He who can hear the butterflies laughing knows the taste of the clouds.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need a good one.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will submit.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There is no hope.
Eid is not for you to slaughter like cattle!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like him at all.
My work time just ended.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, warm it in the microwave.
The stream's on our right.
Tom is not an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your bag?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
The guy's a thug.
Tom might have seen it.
Tom is a bit of a jerk.
Tom is very immature.
What do you got?
How is the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom isn't drunk, but he's had a few.
I enjoy your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stuck a fork in the socket.
Am I being replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a species of mammal.
Dan reprimanded Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally get it.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
- Did you like his music? - No, did you?
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he doesn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's all coming back.
This will make our job much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even want fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm here on holiday.
He has wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not so young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably wrong.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
I like this one.
Shake your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles is it from here to Boston?
I'm good at that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
It was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's running things around here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Each nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get colder than that.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were stiff.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything is stopped.
Maybe Tom is drunk.
Sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on a map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a pilgrimage.
Look ahead of you.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my latest look.
I haven't been feeling well for two days.
The gut is waste.
We don't think that.
I think Tom is rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a brain and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Going out in the rain is not an option.
I'll tell them to leave right away.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got the Aslan.
There was not a soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
Haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had his doubts.
Tom was throwing a fucking egg at Mary.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the gist.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
Nothing that happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What symptoms are characteristic of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here, anyway?
Do not despair.
I like to watch porn with lesbians.
Who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom immediately became concerned.
I have no feelings for her.
I expected a little better.
I already do.
He's writing a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy was unable to swim across the river.
Tom had arrived before Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're too good.
The old maid has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely got out.
Did they hire you?
There's a gas leak.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can sail in Hawaii all year.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most people think computers will never learn to think.
I'm such a coward.
Bro, you can't just walk up to a woman and punch her - that counts as sexual assault.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your superpower.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We've wrapped the carpet.
Let's have a vote.
Tom is seated.
You can't just do whatever you want.
Sorry to wake you.
Shall I go on?
He was breathing heavily.
I'm a patient man, you know.
That's not happening here.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was muddy.
I'm waiting for the traffic lights to be changed.
The boy was silent.
The hull is divided into several watertight sections.
Considering what you've been cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's not talk about it.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
He has false flashes.
I'm not waiting around forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I'm not waiting for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
Are you mad at me?
He's not the shy boy he used to be.
The count?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys in groups everywhere, some playing chess, some playing the game of chess, some playing the game of chess, some playing the game of ball, some riding a bicycle or riding a wooden horse.
Doubts destroy friendships, and that's what you do.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed in.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain that love inflicts is weaker than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Come on over here.
I just finished breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're going to find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom refused to accept Mary's apology.
You've scratched your head.
We're going back.
Give me back the seat.
What's his purpose?
What is Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?
Tom is furious.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom buy Mary off?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yes, I am mad at you.
It's less humid today than it was yesterday.
I'm having a hard time making new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do something?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell which one the baby wants, because it's pointing at both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to get home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us are going to do anything to help you.
Tom caught a bad cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false lead.
Tom was fighting.
I said he might come back.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
Tom was.
I'm not judging you.
Someone is singing.
Can you fix a thing?
Go on, then.
I forgot his address.
Are you a luncher?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her midriff has a slit on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom is too busy to help.
I'm doing well.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had an agreement.
Everyone is waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very pretty lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom is breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one comes with me.
I know Tom will get out of prison at some point.
The most expensive thing is land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom has made a list of things we need to do.
Tom is a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is acidic.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this one.
Tom was the first one to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
You up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was suffering from pneumonia, I just languished in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I had a decent meal.
You took an oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard right.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, my God.
There's no one there.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He is greedy.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm fascinated by you, Tom.
Tom is a jerk.
Tom is not listening.
They want everything you said you'd give them.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's settled?
Is that necessary?
Tom stayed behind.
I'll never cut you off.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you should call them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What's the use of doing this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want to work in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love the German donuts.
We were 18 years old.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran off.
Keep it up.
This is disgusting.
Tom is really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already told you I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom began to mourn.
I think you should choose her.
Behave yourself.
You are awesome.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it up.
Tom gave Mary a harsh look.
Tom was wearing a sweatshirt.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It doesn't burn.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if I can.
It's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't do the dishes.
Tom is a joker.
I've been through a lot worse.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I use that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom is heartbroken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You are a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his mouth full.
They're all in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm just calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they spotted me.
I know Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you a friendly tip?
The statement is wrong: I'm going shopping because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who is Dan talking to?
We were ripped off.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties very often.
He doesn't look like your dad at all.
Tom isn't exactly hardened.
It was after midnight.
That is outrageous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom looked around, expecting something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think I was followed.
They have no defense.
Often, it helps others.
Tom is a big pessimist.
You're entitled to one phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget about them.
Let's get back to the house.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'm going to tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing the best I can.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I'd hate to be the one to get in trouble.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so alone.
I'm going to stop.
I turned the light on.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't envision a party like this, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom spread his toast with butter.
We have work to do.
I heard it like a thunderstorm.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on the ridge.
I'll take anything.
It's not gonna be all right.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's going to be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, that is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to such problems.
You'll be all right.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the potty.
He rarely went there.
Tom is a bad guy.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, the winners are always right, and the losers are always guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if even possible.
This was an arena day.
I have some bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome your weakness.
How many times a day do you take a dump?
I'm just going to sit here.
Do you happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic about this.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about it.
When he came to find me, his whole body was drenched with alcohol.
Tom is gay.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little stake.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come after you, Tom.
He won first place in the competition.
I just want you back.
Dan is smoking marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You're all fucked up.
They all did.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
He's dropped the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How are we gonna find them?
Maybe it seems weird.
No one can escape death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.
Democracy is about encouraging freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a card to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that all we need?
He was despondent because of health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has an earache.
Dan hit him in the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What did Tom do?
It must be the middle of the night.
It's not a good time.
You're out of booze.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get a response from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do that.
Tom became famous.
I got that song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on your mind, Tom?
A mother's advice would outweigh a friend's.
We are not out of the woods yet.
Tom is furious.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a wig.
Dan's wanted by the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second day, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom urgently.
Tom is waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I finished it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom has seen worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to make pasta.
The hunter went deep into the forest and never came back.
You hurt me.
I'll pay what I have to.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop screaming, my head hurts.
You don't have to tell me what to do, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful view!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't eat it.
Tom needs to relax.
I envy Tom. He is a good guy.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I will become stronger.
This elephant is adored by young children.
Thank you very much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on her lipstick.
She has a picture.
She swims well.
The flowers are dying.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very annoying.
We need more American slang of Tatoeba, now!
We feel bad.
Maybe Tom will get scared and quit.
Is this seat available?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I'd like tea.
I wouldn't want to be caught in the middle of that.
Nobody wants to sit with you?
It would be really nice if you kept quiet.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do that.
It wasn't easy.
I was a traveler.
I'm getting kicked out of school.
I often heard him play the melody of the trumpet.
The unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom woke up.
I think Tom will be here on time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me to it.
She's complicated.
Check the gas is off.
Would you be willing to participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the pot.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I took my time.
Mosquitoes enjoy human company.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you get a message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom lit the curtain, all by accident.
Did you say Tom?
It's hard to understand self-harm if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This will hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure is building.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom has been driving that car for three years.
Can myrrh be used in food?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.
Tom is the guide.
He saved Tom.
You don't have your problems solved, do you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy right now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom got very angry.
What situations would you use it for?
Can we start over?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without any help.
We are all at risk.
Tom won't like it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Get Tom's gun. Get him out of here.
Look back at you.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you play any sports?
Tom, I want you to meet your new nanny.
He's worried about getting lung cancer.
I'm studying a lot.
Tom played the piano for three hours without a break.
I got a quality one.
Did you find someone to watch the baby?
I'm being quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom giggled out loud.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you have any intention of helping me?
The current government has many problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not saying anything.
That would be good.
It's a quick walk.
Tom is very tight.
That's all I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda out of there safely.
They're my cousins.
It's already eleven o'clock.
I'm a homosexual. I'm not a homosexual. I was a homosexual.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom has prepared for me.
I saw it myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There is no replacement.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where none exist.
My sister does the hair in the freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
Rainwater evaporates when it's warm.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom is probably still at school.
I never say anything, even when it makes me angry.
You're below his level.
I'm too tired to sleep.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You'll have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, air the room.
Tom is still trying to talk Mary into taking the job.
How much of our bodies is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me to wait for Tom.
You are very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't be more than five minutes late.
As time passed, the radioactivity decreased.
Are we supposed to believe that?
What are you so worried about?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help?
Tom was set up.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for my computer.
You are a fag.
What are you up to?
Why are you so mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
Don't stop me from helping.
Nobody does anything else.
Sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
It was dismissed.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a good statement.
They must be worried.
I've got him.
That gave me an idea.
The clock face is broken.
I asked around about him.
Tom says that Mary likes you.
Come on, all of you.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom isn't really old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had my camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do that somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
They're a little nasty.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's really good.
Let's get you out of here.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always puts me in a good mood.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a fun character.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me, please.
How many liters of oil does a barrel hold?
Eat slowly.
It's possible there's another world.
We don't have anything you want.
The cherry is green.
Tom regretted what he had said to Mary.
Go and find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom grumbled.
I know what you mean.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm going to scream.
I just got off the phone with them.
Tom is conscious.
Tom brushed his hair.
Everybody is seated.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't feel like walking.
She seems a little young to be married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to start.
His brother's been more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What are your hobbies?
So I'm serious then.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You'll have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you note.
They won't be here tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom returned to Boston.
The light has faded.
- What?
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to get in bed.
Dan is walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I flipped the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's claim.
It's right nearby.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - it is acquired.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
The fabric stretches a lot when it's washed.
Truth is a destination, not a destination.
I blame him.
You ever hear of him?
Tom started to talk.
I skipped class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without a bait, it's going to be hard to catch fish.
Tom took a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I hated you before.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the inhibitions.
Tom needs two hands.
I'll tell him to go right now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you didn't forget something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold.
It's not necessary.
I just wanted to clear the situation.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
This road doesn't go to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom is sober.
Please say that again.
You're being very dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She was at school.
They say that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why don't you buy more of these?
We tried our best.
That's a good one.
We're like brothers now.
Let me cook you something.
You're too busy.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
The police found shoe prints at the crime scene.
That's what I asked.
I'm rather hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom is saving the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's gonna tell him.
Tom sat next to Mary.
Tom shouldn't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom is a dizzy.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this on my own.
They sounded the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
You sure these aren't diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I was done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
You dream you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time for a conversation?
I'm concerned about your health.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is erratic.
Keep your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I feel warm.
Tom was a boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
I like it like that.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I am the one.
Give him a second chance.
I almost cut my sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
The boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two children.
In short, you're guilty.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.

Automated cars are now commonplace.
I can't make that decision.
I reported to the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem.
Tom is wearing chairs.
Whatever you do, you have to do it to the best of your ability.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new money.
I was just waving at Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organist was an older man.
I was playing tennis.
I want you to help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I show you?
I'm making a hurricane.
I like the color blue.
The girl has released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't mess with my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed rabbit.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography in it, it will be made.
I called the clock.
He passed away a few years ago.
Can you teach me to play the violin?
They picked her pretty good.
What's all this?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a debt to spend the night with a smart, witty, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little bit of a whiner.
The girl escapes from home and is freed from parental control.
Tom is a spoiler.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
There was a census in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were writing me a message before the wedding, but you're lying to me, obviously.
Give me a hint.
She undressed to bathe.
A river of sweat started pouring down my face.
Mary abandoned her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just get this over with.
I'm learning math.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you move?
Movies are great entertainment.
I couldn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's only a temporary solution.
We stole it.
You made me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan to leave.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
She's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled because of the weather.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices sound louder.
They might come back.
I'm so scared of you!
The whole board is against it.
The world is lit by the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get your ass over here, Tom.
That wasn't quite right.
I'll see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom was turned into wood.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad company
The airport's nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom is not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The plug is not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary likes hot coffee, and Tom likes lukewarm.
I gave you a fake address.
I got laid.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane will come.
I'm just a little bit shy.
I think so.
I think you're freaking out.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom giggled.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's a lawyer to me?
The sisters sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started to talk.
Tom doesn't look very well.
I'll really try to be nice to Tom.
Tom ate everything.
Where does Tom shop?
He looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How could anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get your shoes on.
I'm having a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him now.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Bring me a drink.
I think I have a cold.
The question is whether or not he can.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls shorter than you.
I need to tighten my belt.
Tom almost got into a fight with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep on the floor.
I'm getting weaker and weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
I feel the same way.
What's got you so upset?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please be on time.
The Germans have a more refined attitude toward nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom isn't going to come back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister is sleeping.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large grave.
Women like men with mustaches.
Forgot your wallet again.
Do you take tips?
I want to know whether Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't see that coming.
Can you deliver this?
I haven't had the luck.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I made Tom very angry.
A week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in there.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The islanders are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I always liked mystery characters more.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic. I'm not sure.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the deal with the hood?
Tom is one of the most distinguished American songwriters.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom wants to never come back here again.
Nobody likes a crybaby.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would if I could.
Tom is very pissed.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We were the first ones there.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes out.
It's so nice to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary a lot.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'm happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the way.
I know I can do better.
You learn fast.
We had a lot of good food.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom doesn't have much to offer.
I got beat up.
No one will ever bore you.
I can't find them.
I didn't know you had one of these.
Look out the window.
Mary bought some smelly trash cans.
I have asthma.
He's used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling in Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is it all there?
Tom lost his passport.
You deserve a medal.
They're really good.
How could you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Can he do as he pleases?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it out.
Tom still isn't fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
I think you already know the answer.
Could you give us a ride?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood was robbing the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this boat?
Yeah, and what?
I asked where Tom was.
You've been a big help.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'm coming to save you.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked.
Who made the doll?
I never lost hope for a moment.
Her long hair was bone-brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, just give him a chance.
I never ask for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Do not speak.
They may need our help.
I got some doughnuts.
I'm studying French.
I'm not looking at you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
The girls won't be playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was careless.
Mary broke off our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We have to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's give him a little privacy.
I never wear a suit.
The heat's broken.
He's out of here.
His clientele is mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That is terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do that, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon hanging out on the beach.
I care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname suits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He drew his sword.
I can't wait to get to Boston.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom seems a little more relaxed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom is a brain-dead.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't speak so loudly
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is repulsive.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book.
Marco thinks he writes everything.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom isn't very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You are such a loser!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom is uncomfortable.
Tom didn't want to get down.
Tom was suspended.
They were getting together.
She's going to be a teacher.
I don't intend to tell Tom that.
I'd like some marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrified.
Tom looks distraught.
It's a little weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that's what's getting in the way?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
Let's hope he's all right.
You're capable but you're a cloak.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on a break now.
We might get a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom became angry.
It's work.
We'll get through this.
Commendation encourages the students to work hard.
Tom isn't very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the deal?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll have it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed himself.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom looks a little shocked.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title dama was used only for nobles.
Tom has been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can a man choose only one?
I came to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dagger driven deep into his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so much fun.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're special.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your children's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom is quite thin.
Tom usually wins arguments.
You can handle this.
Do you hear the thunder?
Don't mix business and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you to him.
I'm glad you're all right.
Your patent is revoked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing can stop us.
Tom is sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss off Tom.
I turned on the fan and aimed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely accurate.
The mice are small.
Please stay close.
We're finished talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as I pushed him up, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was riding in the back seat.
The bank loaned her $1 million to the company.
I have so much more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Are you staying, Tom?
I know what you care about, and I'll do everything in my power to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
I must have had too much to drink yesterday, my head is splitting, I'm so grumpy.
Tom was having fun.
Tom said he couldn't remember the guy's name.
I'm going to grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book I could borrow?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
A sharp sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I checked out the library yesterday.
I've said my piece.
You are ridiculous.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise you I will never do anything to hurt you.
Tom is a loner.
The wife calls the husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more than us.
It's going to be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm really scared.
Dan is angry.
I don't even know what's what.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where I'm gonna put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What is their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they take Tom to the hospital?
It'll make you feel better.
Here are the rules.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.

It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I better call him back.

Go do your homework.

Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems stupid.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Give me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their flaws.
Tom sat behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he planned to cook Mary for dinner.
What do you see here?
I got the impression it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You already got a new guy.
Although Jane had one less suitcase than I did, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You are terrible.
Where does he live, anyway?
Mary is a dust expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.

I had a hamster named Cookie.

Not all aliens are bad.
They were making love.
I burned the trash.
We both did.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my comrades is studying abroad.
In the tropics, there are only two seasons.
I think I made a pretty good point.
I'm replacing it.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why didn't you draw a face on the wall?
Do you think about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just finish this job.
I think Tom is beautiful.
Tom got a little pie.
What is Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said that he can play tennis, but he doesn't like it.
Your new guitar has a nice sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down, please.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.

That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared about Tom a lot.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
It doesn't hold up.
Looks like these two have made up.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I need you right now.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We don't have a broken record.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I made this for you.
You got some nerve, don't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't want it to be like this.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're up.
Get back to work.
What time do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go and look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I'm not at liberty to tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston, Mom?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We do almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits down for long.
Go with the pants.
I thought Tom was sick.
They all did.
How proud I am of you.
Tom was looking through the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll beat you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you get her?
More like it.
The forest was quiet then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was repressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger boobs.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to leave.

There's some more tea in the teapot.

"I see", said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned himself into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.

Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very nice.
The police are looking for me.
Tom isn't that tall.
It's been raining for a week or so.
He's slowly recovering from his illness.
I want a twist.
He's too old to walk fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
She's in the attic.
Her face was smeared with semen.
Tom is fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thank you for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that morally right?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm really confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything you'd say.
Tom is aspiring to become a teacher.
Have a great week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many souls are in the house?
Tom should go home now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
They're too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom is going up.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I can't tell you what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it's started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shaka had a flat tire.
We made ourselves wood.
This is much better.
I'll have her mow your lawn.
Tom is good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You are Brooke.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I know what it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We had lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've been through the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That is so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I'm not getting any benefit from it.
It's still not raining.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
If this happens again, give me a call.
Was he sincere?
The bag was empty.
Don't say a word.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let up.
They're close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire came to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've finished my work.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where do these documents need to be delivered?
Tom has a black eye.
Tom's company is in jeopardy.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom is wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't reach you.
Is that true?
I know you're angry.
When I walked by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, it clouds the bathroom mirror.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately I don't have enough money on me right now.
Are you a vegetarian? No, are you?
Lightning has struck the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped speaking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father had passed.
They gave me another raise.
I'll never set foot in there again.
I'm making a film.
I forgot your number.
Tom has work to do.
What are we doing today?
Do you believe in the horoscope?
I know how to walk.
I'm in it for you.
It was a disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why my name was removed from the list.
Tom set this all up.
I'm not going to give her away.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is soft.
Before that, there was no plant life in this sub-surface.
You are incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's going to believe you?
Who are you going out with?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I had to do.
Tom is very far away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is the one that's cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, what?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I couldn't give him these.
I'm not trained for this.
She has tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom isn't telling the truth.
Are you going to vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet are traveling together.
There's no time to explain.
Am I going to get arrested?
Unfortunately, that's against all the rules.
What are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
A Mr. Kimura is on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's basically true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was leaking pus.
No, and it's not under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw the office papers at Mary.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't necessarily agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They are foreigners.
It is the translator's moral choice whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language that produced them.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
You want to eat?
I need a box of pliers.
I did it.
Take a look.
Hand me the wrench.
Tom seems worried.
It was a meeting.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's politeness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'm going to keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a huge crowd at the party.
Because of the oval orbit, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep into the eyes and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
- You did?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom is white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late for that.
You found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom went home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're going for a walk.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew that Mary would like John.
Tom is a weirdo.
I just got my finger.
I'm going to ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend it.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive nature.
Someone could have followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powdered cure.
We were walking along the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
It's up to you.
It's a work in progress.
Tom reacted badly.
Has Mike stopped drinking alcohol?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her great-granddaughter.
It's our best shot.
It smells like flowers.
Tom snorted.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
She's good at tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a sec.
Have as much fun as you can!
Who are these?
Speak for yourself.
It resulted in great difficulty.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're qualified for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So did we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I will never forget it.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer is stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right with you.
You forgot your backpack!
And so conscience really makes cowards of us all.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You made a mistake.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe that's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen is emitting green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
What about evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we were faced with terrible news.
The wound on the knee is rotting.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom is a farm worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
How long has Tom been asleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What do you eat, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They will.
I'll have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get off here.
We are paranoid.
This is not silver.
A blood vessel ruptured in his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for your car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy person to get along with.
I don't want the pork.
She likes to run.
I need a walnut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom re-read the note.
The children drew pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering why you've been so long.
Did you get a response from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom got married at 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's hearing something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on very often.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have lunch today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to show off the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a resident.
What's on your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
She swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not.
You think you can stop me?
It's pretty common, actually.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to make Tom mad?
Triangles don't have four corners.
There's not enough light in here to read.
Tom got into an argument with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the curtain.
Hey, guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Look what he said.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I looked everywhere.
I'll take it from here.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone is waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your period is coming back.
Tom is wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a questionable answer.
Wake me as soon as they're separated.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down the wall!
Tom looks upset.
Tom was stunned.
It's just the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's going to be hard.
I'm not comfortable in retirement.
Thank you for the question.
I have a good reason for not liking Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll get right on it.
These are her shoes.
Let him call me.
The rooms are occupied.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should never have been sent.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks old?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's on his way.
I don't think Tom will struggle much.
What are you complaining about?
I'll get him right away.
It's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money to have an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince has taken the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for a fact.
I've never felt so loved in my life.
I can't control her.
She drives me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll get it now.
If you kiss me, I will be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I haven't heard back from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will come.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom drives to school.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think about this a lot.
I'll buy the calendar.
Everyone is talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write speeches?
It was a great show.
We have to go find them.
Last time I was home was Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off the hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing this for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
All you've done is give me pain.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night, trying to come up with a plan.
Tom is just angry.
Tom will sleep.
Let's keep the peace!
Tom is well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting was.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
You hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I got a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
TV is boring today.
Oh, that's great!
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say hello to them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be tested.
Where'd you get that scar?
You are nothing.
We're not going to find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
That sounds perfectly valid.
It's the law!
The water is piercing the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any customers complaining.
Look, I like a challenge.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom isn't my cousin.
Beware of the sparks flying from the fireplace.
It's just made up.
Tom kissed Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I'm not telling anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get some soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam coming up.
We're headed for Boston.
Tom is a good father.
Stay here, all right?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately on the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was nasty.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids are so into cake.
He was pretty cool.
I can finally go out with Tom.
Tom became nervous.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all of Tom's money.
Enough of this shit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to bark.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom left work early.
We have everything.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You were right all along.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say "goodbye"?
How many instruments do you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They ignore me.
Stay on the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girl's weak.
Tom and I are done.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom is always here.
It left me in despair.
Tom woke up screaming from a nightmare.
Tom has a weak vision.
The flash was out, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start immediately.
Is that it?
Everybody wants a lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are Tom's things?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not happy to have a peacemaker.
Open up now.
Put on your coat.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about which items to take.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe that Tom was the one who stole Mary's bike.
Does Dan know what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you to come back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom is a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, get in here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll tie you up for you.
I set up Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I saw it happen.
We're going to miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You are very bold.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or is it just me?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom is probably in the kitchen.
Tom is back to himself.
That's the way you should be.
I fell in love with you.
We are manic.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back until tonight.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
He feels that responsibility is a burden.
Tom still plays golf, doesn't he?
I've had too much to eat today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They've set up their tent on the beach.
I didn't want it at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and put another one on it.
Stop it!
Do you want some cheese?
I'll call her for you.
He gets tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not smart by any means.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's a hole.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them kiss you.
Sawing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom probably went out.
We didn't fight.
Tom peered in.
You are at once heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with you or without you.
Let's say for now you're right.
Tom is doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one ever complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
It disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom is a jerk.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You failed us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget that one.
We have to find them first.
I keep track.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a stick.
Tom will kill you.
We both better get some sleep.
I always confuse those two names.
Tom is wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very futuristic.
You're supposed to help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
He's writing a book, and it's great.
Tom turned the crank.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about that, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more deplorable than stupidity and indifference.
They all do.
Tom protested.
What are websites made of?
Vampires are supposed to live forever.
They both smiled.
What's that in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're very sensitive.
I hate the patch.
I didn't say I did.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day cleaning snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
You want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
How far is Boston?
They pay me to help you.
This jacket is too small for me.
I got a discharge.
I asked Tom if he could have it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I'm fine with it.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you as happy as you want me to be.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom took a plane to Boston.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on his way to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the bottle cap out.
Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't keep me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the mantel.
The pigeons are a symbol of peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You're a traitor to the state!
I'll do anything for the good of mankind.
Did he really stay home all night?
The music of Enja is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now that's over.
I feel like sleeping.
There's no scientific evidence that there's a relationship between personality and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
He's from England.
Does anyone disagree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom is a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing computer games.
Maybe you're right.
What's that you're holding?
This is a man's product.
We've been looking everywhere.
I really like your website.
I'm going to get you.
Push this button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom wrecked his car.
You have to overcome the obstacles.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
He's going to do something.
I think Tom is cruel.
He didn't answer my letter.
We settled down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a text from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a shovel.
Many trees have fallen.
Lions can't see colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is funny.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed that Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can see you married to Tom.
Tom is acting polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I've got a little pus coming out of my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We are in real danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These guys don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to learn.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm putting the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever has.
We packed their suitcases.
What kept you awake last night?
They've put a curse on us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The beetles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom is very sleepy.
Are you helping him?
He looks drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember that.
Did you drive here?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure of it.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're among friends.
You're a little weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you hear?
The question is who makes that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for having me.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs to the sub.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for fools.
Why would I help him?
Tom shined his shoes.
We lost faith in humanity.
Tom is shaking hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I in your way?
End violence; fight for peace.
Watch what I do.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom is getting it.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants are dead.
You got it, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna be very sorry to hear that.
I'm a fag. I'm not a fag.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
May I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should look.
It's time for dinner.
I'm working on it.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's got a crush on the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in here.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses for a month.
No one is talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom shaved his face.
What good are you to me?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when I wear that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They're living on the floor below this one now.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain, but he wouldn't budge.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom is laughing at you.
I think I'll go eat out.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
Tom asked us to babysit his child.
I've crossed out the word "Alice" to emphasize it.
Third chance.
We should go.
This air-dried dough is popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
To strive for virtue and to renounce vice.
You are a genius.
I'm against the project.
- You weren't tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm the zombie!
I got there too late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is quite harmless.
There are reports to be written.
It hurts here.
You're worrying Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just making fun of you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish it tomorrow.
You skipped a button.
Diseases often strike at the most inopportune time.
The dog stared at me like it wanted to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and not really human at all.
The man is hungry.
Tell him we're in the middle of something.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everybody dies sometime.
I know how to keep my cool.
We like the beautiful.
I think about it all day long.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a monstrous structure.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did that on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats are bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying above the clouds.
I like it a lot!
Is this correct English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She's got ears like a sail.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom sat alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not being misunderstood.
Tom is harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom withdrew.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are red.
Maybe we can find something.
You look really good.
You made Tom unhappy.
Warm him up.
Tom looked like he was upset.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become stronger physically and mentally.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to walk.
Do you have a map of Boston?
You've got it.
I got a 9 on my chemistry test.
You were lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was charismatic.
How was the dance?
I'm a student here.
It's too dark for me.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
They moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do anything.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
The headlines should attract the attention of the reader.
He was sitting in front of me.
I would rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anybody.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
It worked.
I was watching a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was making fun of Mary.
Tom is full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says that the child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a tumultuous relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
He called us.
Maybe Tom could sing at our wedding.
Which would Tom choose?
The hospital there isn't very big.
Most people have to work to make a living.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary is pregnant.
We're going to stay.
I'm not petting their dog.
I didn't sleep well.
I don't want to and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty between the ages of ten and eleven, and boys between the ages of eleven and twelve.
It's on.
Tell Tom he must not forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon clear.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I'm still not allowed to tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was a donor.
It was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I have a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't be dragging yourself home.
Tom taught me to sing.
What book are you reading? A novel.
Your car is on fire.
That gun is not a toy, boy!
Half of the species are female.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
Those are Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do community service to make up for all I've done.
Tom tied his shoes.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is gorgeous.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I had to take into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the wasps poisonous?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're lying to yourself, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a graduation party.
Mary was very supportive.
Tom is in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
I was a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Tom like Mary?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows how to make a bonbon.
You've seen what I can do.
We have a lot of money.
Does your appearance fit your age?
Can I have a menu?
It's not all milk and honey in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom got himself in.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is poor.
It's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
Hawks have a sharp look.
I wrote it for them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was honking.
We need a new carpet.
We share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
The teahouse is pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom took off his carpet.
They went for a walk.
This is his maternal grandfather.
I want specific information.
Friendship is magic.
The volcano is active again.
Tom told me he had some things to take care of.
How is that gonna help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The little island looks like a turtle from a distance.
Do they bite the trout?
What did you ask Tom?
Stop whining.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait up.
You have no idea how much time left.
The dog barked at him.
Let's go to the movies.
Good women age much better than pretty women.
Tom has sheep.
He tripped.
Mary felt her face warm.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom had retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom is a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
Don't bother me.
Tell me what happened again.
Tom picked up a needle.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She works from nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts like hell in here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was cut off.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's not natural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll bring her in.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom is replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
You're smart, though.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure that we could trust Tom.
Everybody's laughing at him.
Faith implies hope for what reason cannot hope for.
Tom was my friend.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're wasting your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The rash is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They elected a new government.
I'll wash the dishes. Okay, I'll do the wiping.
I would buy it.
He's the one who's sneaking around back there.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom is a wetter.
They asked for a raise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom isn't here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I'd have loved to have lunch with you.
What did you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
- And see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
It's entirely possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's all a bit of a setup.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
You got it?
My day was filled with activity.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father is sick with the flu.
I'm not waiting very long.
Look at you.
This is great.
It's missing the void before both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should see a dentist.
The soldiers were firing.
Tom doesn't put up with that.
The store is closed.
They listened.
Tom went outside.
This is all I can do.
He sticks to his principles.
Tom is furious.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
The naked man.
Tom is a big tit.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I've been asking about them.
I'm sleeping now.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
They're all writhing like a jaguar.
You have to pay your rent in advance.
Put all the trash in the bin.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
Will you think about it?
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom sat at a desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk too fast. I'm not going to talk.
You go pick up Tom and get everything back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you what little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off the mask.
That's certainly an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm proud of myself.
I liked the way you danced.
I need some.
We were tricked.
Tom is the one on the right.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now point it out.
It's white.
Have a seat.
Iron is harder than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me out tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the play start?
Can I just talk to you for a second?
We're not gonna let you die.
The condors are eating me up.
Tom didn't say anything about that.
It's probably right.
We had to walk home in the rain.
I like being alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom wasn't sleeping well.
I screwed up.
The bees.
The answer is confirmed.
I knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go and wake Tom up.
How will I find him?
The ice has melted.
I got a little blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
That must be a relief.
I never got caught.
I love my country.
I never learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle that.
Don't lecture me on this.
Tom is comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They all look in the mirror.
I'm not the type to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom walked Mary to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two are against me!
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
You got a cigarette?
The kids are upstairs.
I'm a music major.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
Pretty proud of that.
- You better not count.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'm going to send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary had caught a fish.
It's nice to be home.
It's not that bad.
They're going away.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It's probably not worth the wait.
I need to buy a new room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
Today is sunny, but cold.
What is this all about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary have been on the run since day one.
Let's move.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
"Will you not eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later".
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off the rug.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find Tom for you.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom was singing.
Tom isn't that tall.
She wears a leather belt around her waist.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I'll go and look for them.
Tom came in spite of the rain.
I don't want to use a dildo. I prefer real cocks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom made a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me to it.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
He's not fighting.
I'm expecting your help.
Tom will go alone.
Tom only had A's in school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are pure.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The seal has a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom is allergic to pollen.
Local politicians have been contacted.
Tom is taking notes.
They gave me this map.
We're going to have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat this apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom is weird.
That was very nice.
My father gives me a $10 a week allowance.
I heard you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe. I know.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom kissed me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with a toothpick, right?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you like to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over to our house to help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's cool.
I couldn't sleep all night.
You have to trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want robots?
They lose their minds.
He really turns me on.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear is biting itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three brown sugar spoons in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom settled down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I had my doubts.
Tom isn't doing what he's supposed to.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do after that?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you just lower the price a little bit?
I'll leave first.
Tom is now thirty years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a grandmother just days before her 99th birthday.
Did you look everywhere?
It's important to remember that no one is ever 100% nothing.
He gestures when he talks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. However, because of his age and frail health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more live longer than those who are run over by a truck.
I talk to her often.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom sharpened the tree.
The ground is still wet, the sword will probably give up.
I was dozing.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever had a blow job?
The dog followed me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom left.
She's aspiring to be an actress.
I broke my plastic bottle.
Is this our cabin?
Let's get this over with.
We are too sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's brilliant.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can get a message to her.
She's a little more red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We should help her.
Tom stood and remained silent.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Is this where you live?
This looks like a carriage house.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom is a bit of a pussy.
We don't have to go.
I'm speaking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The peas are soft.
It doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind continued to blow.
Meanwhile, the fool uncle was sitting in the living room.
Was I talking to you?
The muscles fall out of the tree.
Do you have a band?
You can wait here.
I got an A in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
What's the fastest way from here to the post office?
I don't want to bring Tom into this.
It's not a big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you going to wear a mask this year?
I'll do it your way.
I'm not that hot myself.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door is locked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did he react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I long for him.
She's hanging out at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed Mary looking at him.
You're making me feel like shit.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom is a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary did.
Let's talk about this.
I think Tom is nice.
The sky is clear.
The Galamata will wake the baby.
Just look straight.
That's not exactly something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary are playing cards.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'm going to call security.
Tom thinks he'd prefer blue.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm going to do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary to her.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's got it.
The long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom had a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I'm going to get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to.
They both smiled again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt strongly.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom saw danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is a mess.
Tom is the tallest male in the class.
Tom, you've grown up so fast.
That was our only consolation.
No one would have cared.
Have you been writing in your journal today?
I just don't want this to happen again.
Can I do this?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peer through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased a long time.
We can't go into that now.
Why are you so bent?
Come on, Tom. What are you doing?
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're pretty much ready.
Tom has a keen ear.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
He doesn't like me.
Tom stole your money.
You can't take the lid off.
I helped him get the table open.
I had a schnitzel with tomatoes last night.
It's better for your health to walk up stairs.
Tom bought the coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is a bitch.
I'm sorry I said anything to them.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at 2:30.
Tom is a pro.
I slept in the hay.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold for shorts?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
French was originally a slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife establish her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look it up in the dictionary.
Go and find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real pain.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We would have had a lot of fun if we had gone to the party.
He saved the bell.
He kicked me in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems confused.
You're having fun, you're young.
You are free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
You really think you're gonna be able to get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
This meat smells bad.
So I should know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing without a connection.
She runs slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom is fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just rented Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I would have sold this dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help the comrades.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing in here is mine.
My son is very fond of rockets.
You'll have to hurry.
Everybody is talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom is a pimp.
We despise her.
You got there before them.
Here, brother, half of it.
Tom sent the new mouse he had just bought to the table.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom is a coward.
The scenery is magnificent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We should test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to keep it together.
Autumn has come.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for it to boil in the water.
I could get fired for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You are drunk!
It was quite majestic.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer that question.
I want to sign up for a class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything by himself.
What's the best part?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom continued to practice.
Try to understand.
It'll cost you nothing to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom peered into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
I know that.
I envy you.
I offered to blow his dick, but he said he wasn't up for it.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The herb is also popular in the form of rosemary, thyme, and oregano.
We are lazy.
You're a very perceptive man.
Everything seemed to be fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
The unknown always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I can keep a secret.
I don't want to run.
I'm actually kind of flattered.
I'm working out.
She may have fooled you, but she's not gonna fool me!
Let's just catch some fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
They got me.
Tom reached into his bag and pulled out some money.
The room was a nuthouse.
It's easy to solve this problem.
They have to remove the bullet that was lodged in his spine.
It's fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We are good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to be bitten by a catfish.
We import grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan before.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom is gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers are not good against the ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it's not a good idea to ask Tom.
My brother will arrive first thing in the morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes high in calories?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go and ask him.
You're lucky I didn't hit you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make faces at him.
I waited outside.
You are impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton.
May I have your name and telephone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everybody knows about it.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry about Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They stood under the rafters in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
I was hired to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really get it.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I should break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm going to check on Tom.
That's a nice coat.
I like your coffee.
They're all under the table.
I still think about her.
I found out today that there's a movie called "The Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary missed school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you. Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'll take the call.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom is in trouble?
I'm not good at that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thanks for yesterday.
You got enough?
The fungi are carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom is bored.
I start tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the downfall of the monarchy.
I'm so pissed at Tom.
I like the bones roasted.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep at the wheel and caused a traffic accident.
We were suffocated.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was just wonderful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
It's all right.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be awesome.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How does this camera work?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't get too carried away.
Tom is a book reviewer.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
You need help with something?
It's so wonderful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get down this mountain.
I'm just starving to death.
I got disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You worry too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you the book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom is old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Be careful, Tom.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to be up till 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should just give up?
That's not wise.
Women in America did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom is dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom is not listening to us.
Tom is a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom is going somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm clock is ringing.
I'm sorry I wasn't more supportive.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'm staying here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That is an undeniable fact.
Is it good?
Watch your back!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much, you know?
You're a good man.
Tom froze a little.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Madeline.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is wrong.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring it.
The primates are a species of mammal.
I'll get started
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the bull going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
When a grown-up child lies, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You're going to be in danger.
Try your luck!
I might not graduate.
That is very interesting, Tom.
I've heard about it.
Tom took a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open your books.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the shutter.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I will do everything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was a big one.
I want a life.
Tom isn't in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write anything.
This area is in a valley.
You really want to stay until Monday?
I thought you wouldn't be busy.
It's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, decorate the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary on the left.
I'm trying to make my toast with honey.
They've tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot's out of the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on the planet Earth.
I love the sunsets.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom dumped his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is impressed.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the counter.
I'm impressed with your design.
You told me to call you anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom drowned.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the carpet off.
That's what happened before.
I have a theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we fought.
What good is that to us?
I'm right with who I want to be with.
Invite me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
How are you? I'm fine, thank you.
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Hold on a second, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick sentence.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes, and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might get along.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want a spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were just confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has many good qualities.
Go with the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom is not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt that he needed to make amends.
It's a message for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
We'll buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm going to say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He's throwing a rock at the dog.
Tom stared at her.
It's already 7:00.
I'm curious.
We can try.
So you wrote the book yourself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be too fanciful.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must till it.
Tom isn't feeling well today.
We don't see it.
Mahmoud is not a dengue sufferer.
No one listens to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetting and hating usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that had happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted that he spilled red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the tide.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little further down.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't been hungry yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you want.
Just take my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get involved in that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come into the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did this?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I have a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is bullshit.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a question mark.
You have really piercing eyes.
Isn't that what it means?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom into town.
We should let Tom go back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Smoke that and come inside.
Don't let them go.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more trusting.
You want a drink of water?
Tom is not friendly.
However, the amount is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
Squares have four corners.
I kept working.
He's developed an addiction.
Would I like to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary threw herself at her mother.
Pick one of them.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
Do you want me to pick up something from the supermarket?
Finish the mass.
Tom wiped the blade of his knife off his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can make that happen.
Do your nipples bleed?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer jar on the counter.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He gave me a seductive look.
Don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should just come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom is lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
She looked at me through the glasses.
Linda accused Dan of having her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not interrupt Tom.
It's tough and it's durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Is that what you bought these for?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It just came to me.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression at various times in his life.
Do you want me to grab your collar?
I would trust them with my life.
I'm kind of hungry, you know?
I'll give it a shot.
What do you have to worry about?
I need lunch.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class went wild.
There were penguin tracks on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a shopper.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you've made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it out.
I'm not speaking fast.
We need to talk in private.
Tom is not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a small town outside of Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did he mention the test results?
If you want quality, you pay.
Tom was chewing something.
She studies English.
With such a wild dream, he'll either become a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They start beating her.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We came to apologize.
We'll visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom ripped his chewing gum.
Let it be my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended it?
How'd you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to acquire bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she became interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't Tom listen?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are as strong as you are.
The president looked strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad, you know.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do as he pleased.
I thought you were a better chess player than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say it again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a neighbor.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is in a pinch.
Seize the day.
What's the beep, Tom?
He is very handsome.
Let the buyer beware.
Tom often skips classes.
Now it's time to make amends.
Most girls have a whole hymen.
You can get out at the end.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint; when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll get through it.
Does she have a dog?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary was wearing false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he actually did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria did not understand the sermon.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are wet.
That medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look like a fool.
His mother is American.
Just relax a little bit.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We don't need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom has done the job very well.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed nervous.
Please, tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I make the decisions, Tom.
Don't blindly listen to your boss.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works well.
Tom became very ill.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got unhooked.
I prefer goat cheese to cow cheese.
We get that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't had dairy in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was the plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I was up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was Jeevosi.
The boards are chopping wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I need.
Where were you born?
All the way.
Same-sex couples should not be able to marry.
A cow forgets it was once a calf.
Give them the painting.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is handmade.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister cut the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put that cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I believe her?
Who's that girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
I have a stomachache.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me around.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's have a talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies lead to more lies.
I don't have any more money.
The table is plastic.
Sunlight is said to be the best disinfectant.
You'll get your copy.
I have to feed them.
She's always cold.
They're all dead.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary did.
That was very helpful.
He lifted me up.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
He brought it after lunch, and we're planning on taking a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light went on.
John's at the airport.
Tom should have been ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience ache now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Today was the first snow.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work in the morning.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood is circulating through the body.
I'll make him walk.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
Lying won't help.
My right toe hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where did we come from? Where are we going?
I really don't know.
Do you have a spare?
Tom is a buzzkill.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built of stone.
Yes, I did say that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one will bother you.
Tom didn't think about such things.

Let me see it.
What's in it?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost finished.
Marry me.

Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy happens every day.

I'm just glad I could help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do for now.
They should talk.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.

It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.

You're such a pig.
Close the gate.

We're all the same.
I want to be with you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my mistake.
This sounds perfectly reasonable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and trusting and the other was unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I will not bow.
What did you do with Tom yesterday?
I won't forget.

Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
It's possible that Tom is wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom is acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
They're very good.
You like movies?
Time is eternal.

They completely renovated the building's facade, and when I drove past her in my car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all he has?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's only fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children sat in a circle on the floor.
Tom has forgotten.
Invite him to join us.
It's not going to be easy to do without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.

I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
I've been sitting here.
This is not relevant.
I'll be back in a little while.

Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing could happen to us.
There I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.

I have no home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone to help me.
They don't want that.
Tom is picking up.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's a comfort.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said that if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.

I counted to 200.
Keep this.
Should I go?
The boy looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a pity?
How many did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea in concrete terms.
Can I have a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to both of them.
I'm going to lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We're not drinking enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That is ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Can you get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do as I see fit.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'll be all right.
I found something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
That's a lovely alka.
Go see if Tom is in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He extorted a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter one last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it?
I'll go and find another one.
I'm starving to death.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders are spinning.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.

He's in love with you from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything

He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom is drunk on tequila.
My grandmother is deaf, in other words, a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're looking around a lot.
We want more money.
It's not lost.
You get along with your folks?
Tom is being made something.
You should've asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I pay my respects.
Have mercy.
Let's follow the others.
Before I fall asleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should make a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom collected the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the King's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom is a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I going to get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can possibly imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late for me to help you.
We tried to cover it up.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to light your car.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
He was lying to my face.
I'm going to find her.
I wanted to leave.
They listen.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore it, it will go away.
They'd only get in Tom's way.
Maybe I should help her.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on edge.
He's a little deaf, so you might want to speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom is heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's your business.
That's a very dry explanation.
The morning walk is refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
It's not safe here.
A setup for a murder.
There's no response from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming to get her.
Tom was wearing his shirt inside out.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
That was a good dinner.
Get a hold of yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, division is not.
I'm sitting here.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
They're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom will go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in the papers today?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom was squealing smoothly.
It was better.
Tom started snoring.
I'm going to ask you to stay a little longer.
We have two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Tom might be dead by dawn.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was insane.
The can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend that you were hearing about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The pariahs have clouded my glasses.
So, no, not at all.
I didn't mean it like that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the chalk flag?
- Get your shit together!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one.
You're going to try, aren't you?
Tom went without food for a whole week.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Though I am a pious man, I am a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there a problem I should know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so mad at me.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom is basically doing the same thing that Mary is doing.
We need to investigate something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your body?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm the one who got hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started to say something, but Mary stopped him.
We met at the Mean.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I've been all over town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
The nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
This medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom is not involved.
I guess our job is to make sure that doesn't happen.
Why is the universe black?
I got it wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house is cursed.
I baked a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs do not shed.
Tom regained consciousness.
Tom pissed off Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is good at that.
Tom might come today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help?
Don't you pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I turned around.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came to get him.
Let's go once and for all.
Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We were out of there by 11:00.
You can ask me anything you want.
She loved Boston before.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a raise.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it is from another dimension.
They bore me.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for it yet.
Every member must attend.
He didn't get the joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
She hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We are not criminals.
Flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me. I'm not going to let you touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on that subject.
You're being vindicated.
I'll be right there.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's head back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You look very pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
You cut your collarbone playing.
I think Tom is funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is going blind.
You really think this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was arrogant.
This is not an easy decision.
He fulfilled the prophecy.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please inform them.
I have to call her.
She asked me if I was cooking something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
Tom heard a rattle.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you couldn't play the piano?
It's closing time.
Let me handle this.
The stone slid down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom is just crazy.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
I'm not supposed to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom isn't that young.
At the time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin is very cute.
You're such a geek.
Sorry, but we don't take credit cards.
It was fine here.
They look great.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I would never leave the house for a slipper.
I think Tom is a weirdo.
She had a terrible infection and her ovaries were leaking.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't matter.
Tom headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's been acting strange.
We would have hanged them.
Now is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a second.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How did it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in the justice!
What does Tom say?
Why not take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You are influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake out of capers?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him now.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language has a different view of the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
There you go.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom will want to come and drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We have everything.
How much for a beer?
Tom said he couldn't play tennis.
Where did you find her, anyway?
This was the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He is an atheist.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got into the car.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's warm enough for the Demakhs?
I think Tom is dying.
I'm pissed off.
Do you find yourself in awe of him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling you.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I made a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are you putting in this room?
I've already thought of that.
I would do anything for her.
Somebody must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've got your foot in the door.
Are you still there?
You're a thoughtful man.
I was a little confused.
