Members of the Welsh Assembly worry they're being taken for pimps.
Dismay among some of the members of the Assembly, now referred to in English as AM, at the suggestion that they should change the name to MWP (Member of Parliament for Wales).
The debate arose over plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all over the panorama fear being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name rima with Twp and with Pwp.
For those who don't know Welsh, twp means parvo and pwp means caca.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
One Welsh conservative said his group was keeping an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will be up to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the naming of the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of the AM title, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received majority support in a public consultation.
It seems the A.M.s are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could prove a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disqualifying MPs and the design of the committee system.
The MAs will get the final vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday if their country changes its name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote will decide to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the name change in the plebiscite, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price one has to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as the churches of Harlem continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one nor the other.
He said he could understand the bars were gone.
"People are now socializing in different ways", he said.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that people usually go to.
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leaders hope, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who wouldn't help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments in these buildings will be white", he declared, "and therefore they will hasten the closing of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930's.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's tenants made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly christened the carillon as the 'Little Bell of the Poor'.
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who changed it to the Riverside Church's larger carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one has taken his place at St. Martin's.
The ones who have been occupying St. Martin's for the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish and composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the latter "pretends to pass costs on to the board, even though it did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a boy while fishing for lobsters in California
Police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was fishing underwater for lobsters in California on the first day of the shark season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement for catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming "I got caught!"
I've been caught!
Hammel said he noticed when the boy came up to him.
"He shouted to everyone who came out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'", Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officers have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of department stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the massive dive into the UK beauty market, which is now £2.8 billion and continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods fall, the biggest beauty product runners are testing at 11 stores across the country, and then moving on to others next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for something to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves, and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees collections will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's locations; the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores since it bought both chains two years ago, and apparently this has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute the pharmacy's revenue in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We've transformed the image of our beauty runners to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff who can be consulted for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits".
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby retires from £11 million business
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones has left in a fit of rage after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his housewares and accessories brand Truly.
His company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones sparking sparks by withdrawing from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new golden contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at £1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to the pair's home-wear and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday residences.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave stunned all involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and textiles for the home, and could further delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones stated last night that "we should not comment on his business affairs".
A complicated conversation And then we fell in love
He played on the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not very presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said in his "news anchor" voice.
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after their initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks stalled.
More than three weeks after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"Things with North Korea are going well", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship.
He claimed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and bringing back remaining American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, signaling to the crowd that was right in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge", said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute their help.
Given the earthquakes Indonesia endures constantly, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly found on other coasts.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was deployed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's decaying infrastructure, and he lavished money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is hit by a huge funding shortfall in the run-up to next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living their faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands forced from their homes by street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal in the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot to the second toe.
The ball flew over the area as it moved towards the top left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga that was jumping in the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get organized, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to score as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"They came up to Kante and they said a knock without thinking too much and I just shot".
Chelsea won 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning around near the half-way point and running into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic built a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful deep pass driving Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and finished second on the stick scoring a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the national disaster management agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything to step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: 'The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call to contact us if anyone has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera on the dashboard that contacts us, as they may have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a Birkenhead neighbour and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues while police say they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but police informed him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just been told they won't be able to re-enter for a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene crying.
He keeps saying "It's horrible".
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 citing registration 247 dated September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history".
Their ban would be poetic justice for their Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by their fanatical, puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr Crick's suggestion "disparate" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell situated outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the prevailing opinion in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still worthy of homage.
Mr Goldsmith stated to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than now, as the defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a fully complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A murderous pig slaughters a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a cutlery in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
She apparently traveled with her cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent lock.
He said there was a big male in the cutter with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to death.
"My cousin had bloody, slashed legs", the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed her pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although not very common, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the couple's farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had run a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife came along and scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't mean to hurt.
You just have to give them the respect they need, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, widespread rainfall to the southwestern United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 miles per hour and was located about 400 miles (620 km) from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm surge is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, penetrating the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 liters per square meter of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
At the local level, rainfall of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and the possibility of desert landslides.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, rainfall is expected to be 50 to 100 l/m2, especially over much of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form canyons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring in locally blowing winds and dust.
The landslide will bring local heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause minor debris flow and slippery roads.
This would be the first rains of the region's wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, lasting until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature swings in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, we're going to see a great example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central United States.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
A warm start to October is expected for the central and eastern parts of the country, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern part of the country during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels the heartwarming testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues and the networks interrupt their usual schedule for a late Friday newscast: an agreement engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's 100% sure that Kavanaugh did it while he was drunk and tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this hadn't happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that over 20.4 million people had watched it.
The company has counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that rebroadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people watching TV from offices.
To give you an idea, it's an audience similar to a football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which heavily supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a daylong trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on TV.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being tapped by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator en route to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained with his eyes down for several minutes as he was reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They told her, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women".
Flake said his office made a statement. Flake, before the elevator was shut down, added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All TV and cable networks were broadcasting live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate to submit to a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, something a minority of Democrats had been urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After further discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside his on the front page, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the other party's tariffs was totally absurd.
Wayde Sims murdered: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and imprisoned on one count of second-degree murder.
Officers released video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he was placed on a $350,000 bond.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their diligence and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20.
The 2.01-pound forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "deeply devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
"This is what we worry about all the time", Wade stated.
Volcano throws ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several thunder and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of neighborhoods in Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked vigilantes held back by riot police by shoveling eggs and painting them in dust that created clouds of dark dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also skirmishes later that same day with the police, who used the batons to contain the riot.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Neither forget nor forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained in the protest, according to local media.
Tensions continue to flare in the separatist region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, though deemed illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low and anti-secessionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place the same way but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence rally with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would ever achieve independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck, he commented.
Despite securing a narrow, albeit decisive, victory in the regional elections of last December, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the demonstration in support of the police on his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"There's more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashed into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 (UK Summer Time).
Police Investigative Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the shackle and the building itself to be the damaged parts.
It's also possible that a basket was fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The rising Livingston stunned Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to move up a level to place behind Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side are still unbeaten away from home this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, with eight points to spare.
But first, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continue to go undefeated in the division for the sixth straight season; head coach Holt has yet to see a defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team must have been ahead long before they scored, as with his control they caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his cross shot did not cross the goal line; next, Alan Lithgow's shot went out driven by a headshot from Craig Halkett from across the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger the visitors in the standoff games.
And that's how the deciding goal came.
The Rangers allowed a free throw and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers were dominating possession but faced an impenetrable defense that avoided much work for guard Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out on another play to Livingston's standoff.
There were many cross-country passes in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were denied: one by hand and one by an inning from Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis of the
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
And I'm unanimous in saying they've been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their upward trajectory.
His style of play and players have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, but part of the credit is to Holt for the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organised defense while Menga gave no breath throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers were short of inspiration.
Despite working well on occasion under Gerrard, this time they did not reach that level.
They missed the last pass, only managed to penetrate the home team once, all a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which he intends to fix relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflected the division in front of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision in which he was hit by a car in London.
The accident took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 am (UK time).
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are road closures and buses diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison altercation, according to the prison official.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 am (UK Daylight Saving Time) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
A Tornado unit of specialised officers has been deployed to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are being held in a pavilion.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police officers had to go to the prison to calm a riot in which staff were beaten with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (drought-affected areas could benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it's highly likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service indicated in a Twitter post that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained depression or tropical storm status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended within a 40-mile (64 km) radius of the Arizona border.
The latest National Weather Service models predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on Arizona's Mogollon Coast.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Roches and the Great Basin, could reach 25 or 50 litres, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 possible.
For those who are out of danger of flash floods, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, since the region is heavily affected by droughts.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain could be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still be hurricane-force Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (136 km/h), is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 12 miles per hour (19 km/h).
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and therefore, losing strength.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or night.
Heavy rain could fall in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total precipitation is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 250 l/m2, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue its ascent through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger from Rosa or what remains of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the Southwest Desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 04:00 (UK time).
He was taken to hospital, where he remains stable".
According to Somerset Police, overnight three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area.
Officers have asked for the cooperation of anyone who had a cell phone recording of the incident.
Trump claims Kavanaugh "suffered the petty anger and the wrath" of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the petty and angry wrath of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she sexually assaulted him decades ago, when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial on his charge.
The president said Saturday that on that day, Americans witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the finest jurists of our time with an unblemished record of public service", he said, addressing the crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president was indirectly referring to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't compete, but I really do, he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for great candidates.
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is to "oppose and obstruct".
The first Senate procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican aide told CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds and the number continues to rise
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them swept away by giant waves that broke ashore when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when waves as high as six meters broke through the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat came, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were killed", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a crowd in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, it destroyed everything it could find", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled at high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the national disaster management agency showed many destroyed tents and buildings, torn and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of a long, narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed" and there was no information from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", he declared.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves would arrive at the time the warning was issued.
In a video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building frantically warning people on the street of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water hits the seashore, sweeping buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that caused the shutdown of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has already begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees continue to urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has exceeded 800.
It's awful.
During the journey that World Vision staff made to get to Palu City, where employees are sheltering in canvas shelters erected in the courtyard of their office, they witnessed scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba commented.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's awful.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of implementing disaster relief, some complained that they were preventing foreign humanitarian aid workers with great knowledge and experience from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, families and friends of the missing clinged to the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that would ease the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a kid out of a dumpster.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body on her back.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the parapant community, he desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages showed only one gray mark instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he added.
$26,750 stolen while charging a cash register in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was reloading a cash register in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier at the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's waiter and stole a bag of money from him that he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, please contact Newport Police by calling 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly known as Kanye West".
For some time now, West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ti, West said that same year while talking about his record with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, they're us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, the evil, the confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
Kanye is another famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, also managed to put and take the script and use the capital letters.
AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, has pledged not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would "never again use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to boys who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young men into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in AI.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, who sampled Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made announcements about AI, even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next AI breakthrough being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-scoring American Othello player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research, a subsidiary of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
"China is not leading academic leaders, it is leading business", he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work on AI.
Lee pointed out that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. push its AI efforts.
"I think they should give residency cards to doctors in AI", he said.
The State Council of China released its next-generation AI Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an AI Center that is intended to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a two billion dollar investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked applications for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents allege that the change would harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities like the EU or NATO from Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, several members of parliament have said they would respect the outcome of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said that as of 1 p.m. there had been no irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up for those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high and not through the service door", Kavadarkov added.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO", Zaev commented after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required level.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result has to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A referendum defeat would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, goes through the whole Brighton defence and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's 2-0 defence of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenses before heading into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He defended himself from a defence before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first area touch to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems at the club", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial lead in the Premier League clash.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton's field on that play.
He sent a beautiful pass to the hole on the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite pole.
The Blue Sky put the ball in the goal before they left the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to throw the Rockies a party.
With the Nationals out of the playoff fight, there wasn't much reason to force another signing.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who take a game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to seal their first division title.
"Even though we didn't play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would be playing probably at the highest level I've played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals haven't announced who will be the starter on Sunday, but they seem inclined to Scherzer being the one to pitch in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his 34th start would be, had another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely pitch on Sunday on his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he talks about the importance of the result in the midterm elections.
"We played everything we did in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big, big thing... I don't compete, but I really do, and that's why I go everywhere fighting for big candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "Look at this horrible group of radical Democrats, look what's happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, malice, and petty.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we're never going to give it to them".
The Democrats' mission is to stand up and get in the way".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, vain, disgusting, and liars".
He enlisted the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which received strong public support.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you leak the document?
Mmm..hey, what?
No, mmm, no, wait -- that was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is not so open anymore.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't really too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not welcomed, and all for speaking our mind.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she faced anti-Semitism with determination.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security and about Europe, which are issues that Jeremy coincidentally disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of the eight years I've been a Labour MP, the Friday night committee meetings have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judging whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect me to portray and take positions that I would never agree with, whether on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public, and I don't really care what I say, there's a tremendous outcry and attacks on social media, censoring the politics of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are often political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insults have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party needed to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are not so open anymore and that with every "non-trust" movement or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower in its sights.
Over the last few years, I've received a lot of advice that tells me to keep my head down, not be so frank and then everything will be fine for me.
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government which had literally dropped my class, I have tried to demand better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused about my political positions and that I do not agree with the current party leadership.
To those who have promoted Friday's motion, all I would say is that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But in fact, the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr takes the lead
The last two attempts may have altered the final result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this pleasant Premier League game from Tenent.
They're now leading the table and the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact that he took a chance, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we have been tested in our matches and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "It must be acknowledged that Ayr took the opportunity better than the rest of us.
The 14th-minute try by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was given up for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed a wrong throw.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just at half-time, turning a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
This was followed by a prolonged break due to a serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a paddle and, since the restart, Ayr made further progress through a Stafford McDowall trial, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with a failed trial by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow card for tackling Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a try from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in David Armstrong's area and sent him to third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth try of the home team.
The protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears poised to enter the restaurant industry after it is revealed he has been appointed CEO of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final one, and it seems Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, although a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Inner Bolivia expects court to clear the way to the Pacific
The sailors were watching a naval headquarters covered in equipment in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
In landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict lives on, as does the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, it expects a positive outcome", Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said.
Many Bolivians will watch the CIX ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will agree with Bolivia, and that little would change if that happened.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the CIX judgment came only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case was not complicated, says the Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be a drawing behind.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill left to Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain them after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually swift decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile, and a chance to end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the issue for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it cannot rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of rebooting nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a utopia" that continued U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington refused to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that delighted the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats filled Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their most amazing creations to the stage.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide fin imitating feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Other large accessories included a jellyfish, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving kit, with glasses and the tube, and the others were a cone of melted ice.
And if you're a big fashion fan, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predicted that giant hats could make their way into stores.
The disproportionate hats come right after the Bombshell, the straw hat with a 60 centimeter bezel that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social media has unveiled another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and topped with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' 2019 spring-summer collection La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage stated to FEMAIL: 'I hope the large hats and beach bags will hit stores next summer, as the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's private schools have a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible standard for pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for their chosen career and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of the recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the table and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages scored an A.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, shows that 72% of students obtained an honours degree in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an outstanding grade.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are being given the same consideration as subjects like science, technology, engineering and math in private school curricula and all sorts of things.
A survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the reasons why employers find it difficult to fill vacancies, lack of language skills account for 17%.
Language skills are therefore increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalised world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the career path you choose, if you learn a second language, you'll have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% didn't speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ from school to school.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, private schools always have multiple languages to choose from and teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish private schools specialise in providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it right.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be over 1 and under 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the weekend's practice, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
At this point in my career, I don't need preseason games to be ready, he said.
Trump's election acts arrive in Virginia, on YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five rallies scheduled by Trump next week, including parades in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote paused for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it votes in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia below via YouTube live stream.
Trump will likely address the issue of the trial this week of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become strained over sexual misconduct allegations and who is holding the Senate confirmation vote in abeyance for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with fresh momentum.
So these five rallies that Trump is giving next week are aimed at "dynamizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in the run-up to the campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who preferred not to be named.
Tonight's rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican nominee for West Virginia's Senate seat, Patrick Morrisey, who's last in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come back to support him in the polls", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday's singles matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome might have been what this Ryder Cup might have needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a totally invented sporting concept but one that athletes really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I guess we take that as a little bit of a boost", said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point lead with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their favor and a lot to cheer about, including the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each have three points from four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
Those guttural cries got stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
On getting the putt that won them the game at 15, he made a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team is not out yet.
"You just have to focus and worry about your party", Spieth said.
It's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and they can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and no last nine holes on Friday morning.
That run, and the way he seems to flow his energy into and out of the crowd, confirms them as rivals to beat on Sunday, and there couldn't be more popular players to get a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dismissed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourball, when he paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first lap ended up with the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to getting out of.
But on Sunday, there'll be no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close for the interactions between the pairs, the advice that's given, the advice that's not given, and the way that you can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stamina to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after exiting the fourball and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to lift four points to the score at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, looking to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, overpowered an American team that was failing in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but they could not cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to score four points from four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they were a perfect fit to defeat a disgruntled Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of 29 games in the fourball and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to settle for a defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and three.
Europe could not always win on a nice breezy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They achieved a 2-1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after missing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in the history of the Ryder Cup in which a team has come back four points in singles, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counter-attack on Sunday seems out of his reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased his distrust of the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its goodwill" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test grounds, and committing to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the US", he added.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first".
While Ri resumed the already well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had been the case with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean Peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive action, even if it opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only exacerbate our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side of this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached a dead end".
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "evil" President Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for her bravery in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said Wednesday that there was no deadline for that, and that it would take two years, three years, five months".
China and Russia are debating whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, on Thursday US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: "Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe complete, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, just hours before North Korea denounced him for making "mafia-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took the appropriate measures.
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are running a course on getting enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is getting all of its students to sleep more in order to combat the growing culture of male-dominated all-night caffeinated study.
One scholar found that students at the world's top university often lack basic knowledge about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of the class, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had significant sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
One section is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it's not going to change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this information, just as we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke", Professor Czeisler added.
The pride culture of staying up all night, he says, still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students that sleep deprivation entailed was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough and good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he notes, and even to prevent weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, which makes you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to run a course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting a bedtime alarm as well as a wake-up call, and that students be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disturb circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men out of the game
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were aiming to record their first home win since a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, which left his side eight points behind Hearts, who were leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga attacked seven minutes before halftime and a low-inspired Rangers lineup never gave the impression that it was going to tie.
While Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
And it could have been a lot worse for the Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury sustained from an alleged throw of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes from the side that had beaten Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 from Livingston who took a point off Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organised set smothered his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-half short sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate on defense, Alan Lithgow, only managed to get him on the second stick.
The Rangers took over, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their play in the offensive field.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt they should have kicked a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely struggled with Lassana Coulibaly's headbutt and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers failed again in the face of Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick Menga for a single out.
Gerrard acted at halftime by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour the visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty in the encounter with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A mainstay of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals".
Evans: "Say, it's definitely going to pop now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" faulty cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" defective and dead cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab.
You can see a protein that's common to many types of cancer and inject it back.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize faulty cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2, and then rejecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "boosts the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to target cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech by wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was spotted in the studio after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again cap, she criticized Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white man and he says, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault lawsuits filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, Chris Rock uploaded footage of West's critique to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time backstage because of his hat.
"They passed me in the background.
They said, 'Don't go out in that hat.'
They intimidated me!
And then they said I was going crazy", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "You want to see me get stung?" saying that I would "wear my superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do".
Try with love".
His comments caused applause in the audience at least twice and the SNL cast members seemed to be embarrassed, he told Variety, with the following testimony from a person who was there given to the publication: "The whole studio was left in absolute silence".
West had been named as the latest replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people puzzled with a rendition of the song I love it, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West won the support of TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST THE MAFIA"
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful".
"So, I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for the stabbing at Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a male hero, saying that such roles on screen result in it seeming that young people often have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something went wrong" and wonders how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "strong enough" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young men feel that they have to be that certain part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
Because clearly something went wrong with the kids".
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that he is "too tired of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a reboot of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his date with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way, it provided me with my future family and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate land in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, in year-on-year terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Much of the disease transmission comes from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data on Republican senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the statements were being made by "ultra-right" websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after all three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with Waters' department and revealed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie".
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was made with anger", wrote Fleischer.
"It implies that you have no temperament for Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
It must remain agreeable and calm".
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if it were true", he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department alerted "law enforcement and appropriate authorities to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the culprits are discovered", he continued, "as well as that they are held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team".
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Back in Action), the spoof of Rowan Atkinson's powerless spy
It is already traditional to look for the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise of this Johnny English parody and action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn (Johnny English Returns).
Will the ironic satire about the issue of the obviously stupid we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English's incompetent, eye-popping, rubber-faced character has renewed his license to ruin things for a second time.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which he sowed chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last outing.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the rotor strokes make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but it gives the impression that humor is weak and strangely superfluous, especially when these kinds of "serious" films, like 007 and Mission: Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of their ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was aimed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant adventures are not as ingenious or focused as Atkinson's silent film jokes in his portrayal of the character of Bean.
Now the constantly-present argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrates Britain's super-secret web spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, much to the distress of the agent on duty, an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the culmination of a pompous and conflicted prime minister, who is already suffering a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisors inform you that since all active spies have committed, you will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a professor at some snob institution, but gives off-the-record classes on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there's some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his long-suffering partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, a role he is keen to play in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service mishaps are back in action, running into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is succumbing dangerously to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falcatruas: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create a riot that illegally gets them aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes total anarchy by attempting to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
Obviously, all the arrests are from that last sequence, but the kind and outrageous way it is, it looks like it's from a children's TV show.
The result is pretty regular.
And, as with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will see Britons working four days a week but being paid for five.
The party allegedly wants employers to pass on the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would give the workers a three-day weekend, but they would still be paid the same.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day weekly shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not part of party policy and is not being considered by the party".
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to bolster his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim the power of the "anonymous directors" and the "speculators" in the public service companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies will not recover their full investment, as a Labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of shares in private sector companies to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, decisive".
However, Graham's vote seems to be immovable.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive lineup of stars performing and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the success rate of Global Citizen 12 years after achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism", people who think they make a difference by signing a petition online or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "shares" from its followers, driving a different set of goals.
It claims that these actions helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementing society that has pledged to "help children develop to their full potential", pledging to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like yourself, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote of history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just as it was with the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that came before us, we will succeed, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to implement a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports, the US Secretary of the Interior announced.
"If necessary", Washington can resort to the sea to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's engagement in Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to negotiate energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe", he said, reportedly.
Besides, according to the officer, they have the means and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, given that, in practice, they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels", he said, while referring to Russia saying that it "only has one tactic" with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
The statements came as the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said had turned Berlin into Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is justified only on economic grounds and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance got the reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider her 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully consider her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government and that includes a woman in power", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for president".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public meeting, stating that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator would not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by Track Palin at the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what is going on again, I can see reflected in other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with", she explained to an audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "come back different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the military, have offered to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit regarding a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or organized crime.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly brief in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Sessions v. Grace lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
They arrested her in Texas.
Lawyers from Grace's backing states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates that principle", the court's report explained.
Prosecutors further argued in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants damages the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and organized crime.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions stated in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as casualties double in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"Circumstances are very tense", says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their flooded belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing and strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that her family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then I just kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope you're safe".
The US ambassador accuses China of abusing "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper touting the benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump made reference to the paid-for China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the US congressional elections, which are due to take place on November 6, a claim China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials coined on Reuters as a new phase of a growing campaign by Washington to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witnessing the levelling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, China's countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
An opinion piece written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, argued that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the cherished American tradition of free speech and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the newspaper outlet located at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he adds.
He also claims that "one of the most important newspapers in China declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
The Kavanaugh disaster loses the Republican women's vote just days before the midterm elections.
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last hour for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they in the near future or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, reflected in the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, opponents, in the grip of "It's November!" demonstrated in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectations", Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"It's true that it's high,
But it's going to be even more, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs or those between 18 and 29, who, even though they don't like the president, don't usually go to the polls".
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a backlash if Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week on NBC News.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench or not, the problem is how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between believing Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of those polled believe Ford's testimony completely or probably, versus 35% who support Kavanaugh's testimony.
Also, 38 percent think Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, versus 30 percent who think Ford is.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Instead, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a college party when she was a student at Yale in the '80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee has hinted that Inrupt's intent is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or POD.
Contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company contributes the appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team had spoken to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models overnight.
"We don't need your permission".
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Honouring Bernard Vann, a clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the 29 September 1918 Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were commissioned to unveil a memorial in his honour at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the yoke of intense machine gun fire".
Later he rushed to the line of fire and, with "great courage", led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and shooting down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never live with, but a lesson nonetheless".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which was headlined by the Brentwood Imperial youth band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of this genuine hero is shown by the support of so many people".
Peppa Pig cutting the rolls for MMA fans at the best of times
Imagine you're up all night to enjoy the full Bellator 206 show, and when the best part comes along something stops you.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, six of which were major, and was being broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to meet, the UK audience was stunned to see Peppa Pig appear.
Some were not impressed after spending so many hours awake waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a very bad joke".
"State regulations say that content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so it had to be switched to children's programming", explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's it".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would consider UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we can solve it when we think about repetition", Coker said.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which is Monday for them.
But we're working on a solution.
When the change happened, I started getting a lot of messages, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six, and we wanted to give our fans the most, but we went too far and we're not going to be able to do it.
They make us very angry".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete says that he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
A guest on the first broadcast of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began speaking out for gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first show hosted by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls".
He also stated: "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what has driven me and given me the strength I need to succeed".
I wanted to show that I was "something" so that people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak out because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was a complete surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20-year gap between them was never a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (she competed in her first Olympics at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find anyone your age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth changed Daley's perspective completely.
"If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal", he says.
"But now I know there are things that are much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son for were London 2012 tickets, he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell him that I wouldn't be here to take that front row", Daley shared.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that he really was not invincible", she adds.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew at that moment that this was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling", he confirms.
Heather Small's choice of the song Proud is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied her during her preparation for the Olympics and still puts her hair on the tip.

A low-key Mickelson ended up on the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his technique to make sure this doesn't turn into an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who is participating in the biennial event for the 12th time, was left on the bench by the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourball or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the pinnacle of his career, at 48 years old he does not fit in the tight-fitting Le Golf National course, where the tall grass often punishes misses.
And if that wasn't enough, Mickelson faces in Sunday's ninth match the exact Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start on a good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted her man, though she couldn't say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role I was playing today, patted me on the shoulder, passed me his arm and told me that tomorrow I would be ready", Furyk shared.
"He was completely confident in himself.
He's got a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to the teams last year and this week.
I probably didn't think I'd play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end that's the way things are and that's the way we thought it should be.
Like everybody else, he wants to be out there".
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, a career that never reached the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims his presence also provides intagibles to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, witty person and he likes to mess with people, he's a good guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I like to see how well the younger players have been with him this week.
It's much more with a good player".
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the loss of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Great Danes made their debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal advantage winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by a narrow margin", reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over.
We'll have to go and get them all tomorrow.
We have to go out and do the right thing.
This isn't over until the dots are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I'm not going to tire of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world".
Delighted with the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to have a partner on the side when things are going well, but when you face things on your own, then put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message you need to get to the players, that they bring out the best in themselves tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he needs to get the best out of himself, too".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those laps on the final day, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but ending as a loser brought him the European miracle in Medina".
"I remember every one of the damn words", he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had brought the players together for the final day.
"We have 12 big games, but you want to have a fast start like Brooklyn or Medina.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there's a lot of pressure on those midfield games.
We've prepared our lineup with that in mind and we've put the players in the way we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
"I decided on this order because I think it covers the whole way", Bjorn explained about his selection for the singles.
Germany's new battleship postponed once again
The newest frigate in the German Navy was due to be delivered in 2014, to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and the rising cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class flamenco frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as with concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the younger frigates for up to two years outside of home ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuing delays mean that the warships with the latest technology, which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be obsolete when they enter service.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media reported "crucial defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the personnel needed on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have a dramatic overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached the staggering sum of 3.100 billion euros, compared with the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems of the newer frigates are gaining particular prominence in light of recent warnings that German naval power is making waves.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the navy is running out of ships fit for deployment.
The official says this problem is growing, as old ships have been removed but not replaced by new ones.
He also regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
A new study being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to forage.
The results are expected to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bats Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
Then a habitat map will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect their young and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and aluminum foil also pose a risk, as do glue-laced fly traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who periodically conduct surveys, inspections of children, and, on occasion, even rescues.
The organisation even has Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, estate manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a large bat area", he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees, and a wonderful habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats yet, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the property, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single mother's nest could kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, or molest them, as well as to destroy their young.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, urges people to help:
"There is still much to be learned about bats, and for many of the species, we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him false, claiming that all he wants is for people to identify themselves using his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
The footballer allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after its publication, Ronaldo, 33, branded the news as false in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, no, and a thousand times no.
What was said today is false", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"People want to introduce themselves by using my name.
It's normal, you know.
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectable man", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her annually, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents assert that Ronaldo confirms that both had consensual sexual relations.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was terrified of reprisals and worried about public ridicule.
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to revoke the agreement while she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Carmakers to leave the UK
The UK would forever regret losing its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need to reach an agreement", Clark added.
The Japanese automaker said that, should Brexit fail to reach any agreement, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk to the supply chain in the event of no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line is tight, with parts arriving from UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, the border could be affected and delays and parts shortages could occur.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark claims Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid such border checks".
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best deal, so that we can enjoy the success we have but also make the most of this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to continue these excellent supply chains".
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and Unite union coordinator, said his members are increasingly concerned: "I know from experience that once these jobs go away, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had put forward a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House has stated that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rosenstein could be delayed by another week due to the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Russian aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein talked about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump stated that he would prefer not to have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the Kavanaugh allegations, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week or it could be delayed another week, given everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press to be informed".
Some journalists questioned that assertion, as Sanders has not held a press conference since September 10.
When host Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said the lack of news sessions was not due to an aversion to the bigotry of reporters, though she added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president", he said, though he did not cite any sources to back up that data.
Briefings will continue, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's much better than asking her questions.
You're witnesses to how we've been doing this for the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference where you can talk directly to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are rare.
Perhaps the president proved the point this week in New York, with a free and sometimes strange appearance before the assembled press.
A letter from the Health Secretary to calm the mood over Brexit
The Health Secretary has sent a letter to EU workers at the NHS in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and expressing their wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a time of unrest for all of us.
So I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the European Union and beyond bring undeniable expertise and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us".
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State coach, informed reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
Apparently, he fainted on the way to the band-line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band-line before taking him on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a reporter for WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are no details yet on the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18.
A stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers who buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and this extra money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp tax increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The stamp tax increase will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will be used to support the government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent, could be up to 3%.
Finance expects the change to raise up to £120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-residents of the UK, which is causing prices to rise and making it harder for people looking to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the estate transfer tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big builders of keeping house prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate the tax revenue percentages on moderately priced houses to fix the "shame of the housing sector" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including controlling rent and banning challenges where the tenant is not at fault.
It also wants to give the municipalities greater powers when it comes to building new housing.
Mrs May stated: 'Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And that's why we need to fix the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as it is for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to be able to coach Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North West club, who are currently third in League One, three points clear of the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B team, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a boy, something I always wanted to experience again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club".
Ross' predecessors in the Sunderland coaching role include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager claims he felt no unease at all about succeeding such established figures at such a large club after previously turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will my success at this moment depend on my being able to get this club back into the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly typical of a Premier League club", he said.
"It won't be an easy task to get here, but I'll probably only consider myself successful here if I can bring the club back to the Premier League".
Ross has just three years as a coach after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the Hearts coaching staff.
During that period he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and managed St Mirren from relegation to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads", he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because I didn't do badly, I made a reasonably good living and enjoyed some success.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to get over every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of work, but I enjoy training.
I've always enjoyed training, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I ever have in my adult life".

According to one survey, the perfect time to drink a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase during July, but consumption in restaurants fell 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, member of the CGA business advisory group responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's longer-than-expected stay in the world cup have led to a similar pattern in July to that of June, with pubs enjoying a 2.8 per cent increase in consumption, although restaurants have suffered an even greater penalty.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
The best-performing pubs and bars were those that specialized in beverages, with increases in consumption greater than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and eating decreased by 3 percent".
Paul Newman, employed by the leisure and hospitality analytics firm RSM, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in out-of-home consumption.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, but a 4.8 percent drop per year will be especially painful when added to this by the continuing rise in costs.
The hot, long summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant business and time will tell whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide much-needed respite for the sector".
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined profits of over £9 billion and is considered the benchmark for the sector.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have secret social networking accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "fake" Instagram pages.
This news has sparked a growing fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults from knowing.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in the number of "fake Insta" accounts.
This news has sparked a growing fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a soft "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenage girl asking to be "raped".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan stated: "It's alarming that there are so many teens tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, in the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from his inclusion on the board", Beattie said.
Doyle stated the following: "I am very much looking forward to being a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help run the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of Olympic gold medallists and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from being able to walk.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and now I do agility exercises.

An ad for a breast milk extractor comparing women to cows divides public opinion on social media
A breast-milk company has divided public opinion online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To announce the launch of what has been called "the world's first portable silent breast milk extractor", Elvie released a wry music video-style announcement to demonstrate the freedom that the new breast milk extractor offers mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows to the beat of a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I'm moving myself, but I don't have a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on, "Woman, woman, I'm feeding the babies, woman, woman, I'm kissing my friends".
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy on social media.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has sparked mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom said it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but in their case we steal their children days after they give birth", wrote one.

Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added: "What an announcement with so little tact".
Other viewers defended the ad, even one woman claiming she found the song "very funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
Pulling out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I interpreted it as a joke.
I think it's a great product", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who suckle (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like 'cows.'
This is not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with discreet extractors inserted into their fingertips.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who milk themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal sucker, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that come with it while demonstrating in an entertaining and close-up way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new milk extractor will offer.
It's not the first time the Elvie extractor has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased despite the monthly number of border crossings remaining relatively unchanged, in part due to the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it difficult to assign godparents for children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective godparents and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested unaccompanied child sponsorship.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are godparents or family members of these people are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals", Mr Albence said.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require one of the children to appear in court before the month of their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference rather than in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent abductions or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and system reports released over the past few months.
Lawyers said such fears are heightened in larger centers like Tornillo, where there is a greater chance that the symptoms of a child's distress will go unnoticed because of their size.
They also added that moving children to the campground without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a traumatic experience that many continue to suffer.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "deal with them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He also stated that Damascus would continue "fighting this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arab opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were right for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We are turning to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed for continued political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions targeting jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra front, "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate holding elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for securing the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the body's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals are expecting, impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidency".
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up 1.7 million from four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, I asked him.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment within chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the plots coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the state of the global economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it takes more than being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin bomber jacket ("a garment full of arrogance", the Washington Post claimed), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's scathing descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night", said Brent Montgomery, senior executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the character changes and daily plot twists of the Trump show (the conflict with the NFL, the eulogies to Kim Jong-un...).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked in his house watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
I couldn't get off the hook while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss commented.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right".

Foreign money comes in in droves to fund House candidates for midterm elections.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is receiving a huge cash flow due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two incumbent representatives in the race to fill the same office.
This recently reorganized district in the outskirts of Pittsburgh is represented by the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the old districts' electoral district in their favor.
The race in the new 17th congressional district sparked a festival of campaign finance between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after achieving a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed a wide following.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China and then backed down.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked the Trump Organization's management team out.
State Department officials decided to order the return of the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "after recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman in a statement this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in US aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was contested.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed holding a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from migrating to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions being imposed on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration places on it, the diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations as long as the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration who also agreed to speak on condition of anonymity.
Studying history
The next negative case could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public record.
Reportedly, Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable by that body, just as he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy either speeds up or slows down.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a running water since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein has stated that the information in The Times is not true.
"What are we going to do if the investigation that has just been requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unbiased or if his nomination to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite the appalling allegations of sexual abuse and perjury?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I think we won't fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was the headquarters of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is showing optimism for the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old declared.
"We went into the game thinking we could get something positive and we scored a point.
We had a chance to win in the end, but overall, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
Next Thursday is another big European night.
We hope we can get the three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to get a positive result.
Last year was tough with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that happened in the team, but there's a great atmosphere right now.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope we can fight, forget about last season and succeed".
Women are concerned about saving for their retirement.
Despite the fact that survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their families about it.
About half of the participants in this Nationwide study said they discussed with their partners the cost of extended care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they're not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance department.
You can start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to agree on where and how you can receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your financial adviser may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notarial power of attorney to manage your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and to make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down that information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just the money that's at stake, but who are the doctors who treat you?" asked Martin.
"What medication are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

Man shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 02:30 (UK time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
Her injuries are not serious and police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to rise further.
Due to the communication disruption, rescue teams were unable to obtain any information from Donggala Regency, an area located north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline to the northwest of Celebes Island.
This regency, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Célebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have hit in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Aceh province of Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice for domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a notice released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, they took her phone away.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, in which he pleaded "not guilty, of course" when questioned, the jail reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing a domestic violence complaint from being filed, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His fiancée accused him of giving him a tip to punch him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome he suffers from after serving with the Army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia kill hundreds of people
At least 384 people are dead after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake struck just in front of Celebes Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking to apply a rarely applied death penalty for the suspect in a New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist bombing that killed eight people, a sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway Avenue, slashing the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and that he caused them serious injury "intentionally", according to the notification of the intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offenses involve the possibility of the death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice routinely used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violent and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said in describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent to prosecute.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York hasn't prosecuted a death penalty case in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal New York case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the bombing, he was inspired by ISIS videos he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also requested to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of felony murder.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys charged with representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with life imprisonment without possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an "army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that she should take over the negotiations with the EU).
The ordinary MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that the UK would have already left the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her party's divided ranks was made clear when the Remain Tories joined an independent anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her commitments to the Chequers plan amidst attacks from the Brexiters, the Opposition and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to get a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated at the Solihull Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been appointed, we would be out of the EU by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to support Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan".
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated the following: We do not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false.'
Tory and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, from which she told reporters: "All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said at the rally that it is necessary to make politicians "feel uncomfortable" if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"At present this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
We are mobilizing the army of people from this country who gave us the victory over Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and self-governing United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A number of activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security problems they suffered on a party app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a borderless free market in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete sham.
The concept of a good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 campaign co-chair in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that she will succeed Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the council format since Trump took office.
An aide asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington and fix the problems of our government, and that's why we need a woman in the presidency.
An arrest has been made in connection with the fatal shooting of LSU player Sims.
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders that allowed him to achieve victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would prove decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was starting from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone as he defended his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in a pit stop one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went one ahead after several wheel-to-wheel manoeuvres that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior at risk of being behind after a double defensive manoeuvre in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the starting grid and climbed to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for much of this thanks to retaining his tyres to get faster in the final part and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered boxing on lap 44 but could not advance any position in the final eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the top two spots, Hamilton said.
Inappropriate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a ceremony on Saturday for insisting she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at a West Virginia event, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and instead commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that the people were "miserable, disgusting and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see that people who are angry and that is miserable, disgusting and lying", he said.
When you see these posts and leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I wasn't".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you made any leaks?
Remember his answer -- did you leak the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I was just...
I wasn't.
Hold on a second.
Did we filter it?... No. " He added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
You asked me to keep your confidentiality, and I did what you asked.
But his denial didn't seem to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night event: Tell them that the body language wasn't the right one.
He may not have been leaked, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don't care who they harm, who they have to trample to regain power and control, the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the loss suffered on Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the replay 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home run lead before Dwyer re-established the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard drew for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to secure the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to bounce back to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won three straight.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after an assist from David Rutherford.
In a tense first period, Sullivan re-entered the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the goal of the tie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants had a lead on the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again tied the game with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured the victory by scoring their team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to make sure that hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after dying to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll stands at 800 and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of Palu city.
Although his co-workers fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the violently rocking control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could potentially save hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks our hearts to hear about it", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be continuing to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them have not been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Potable water is scarce.
People are looting the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had earlier this year suffered earthquakes in Lombok that killed over 550 people.
Air Niugini now claims one missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one missing after previously claiming that all 47 passengers and crew left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the United States Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane overshot the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, commented that he entered with very little height.
"That's an extremely positive thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to get through the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and scared, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The United States Navy said that some sailors who were working nearby on improving a pier also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sank about 100 feet (30 m).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors returned to evidence Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that she received location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis met with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting her earlier claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When this data showed that his cell phone was on the same time as Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he testified that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"Borrowed from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge expressed his hope that the trial would be heard by the jury for sentencing that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots with political messages and struggles against social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get combative hip hop back into the mainstream.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York City babysitter sues a couple after a "racist" message
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an unsolicited text from the mother complaining that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist and liken the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her distress when she discovered that childcare worker Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOON, another black", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just left, who was African American, had done her job poorly and was expecting a Filipino according to the New York Post ad.
Mrs. Maurice paid her for the day's work and sent her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for severance pay and demands compensation of $350 a day for six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no mediation contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things aren't done", he told the Post on Friday, later adding, "It's a case of discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent you a message that I didn't mean to send.
It's not racist.
We're not racists", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, you two!"
After comparing the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going after someone like that?
That's not very ethical", the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear as might be concluded in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it's published.
It's very funny to know now what we know about the enormous success of Paddington".
After stating that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bitter" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and not presumptuous", he stated.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplished something: you're proud even though you didn't really notice it yourself.
I think he felt the Paddington success a little bit that way.
"Though it was his own creation and the product of his imagination, "he always gave all credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And he did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were slowly being consumed and leaving his body.
It had been dead for some time and now it was going out.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without anyone noticing the ordeal she was undergoing.
"No one detected it", he said.
"I kept my head down and was in tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this amazing sense of solidarity for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her".
Postcards of grieving women preventing suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting up signs on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room".
However, he quit his job before he died and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented: "I have a continuing concern that there will be a side effect".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people they can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent, you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their attitude.
Christmas Day hit bottom (when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything)".
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "It tore the family apart.
They're out of control.
But we have to move forward and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and of limited scope), maybe we could get some unity", Mr Flake commented on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "scrambling" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
With five weeks to go until the midterm elections (November 6), if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI does their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is down under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors heading to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in fees charged by people who are responsible for passing people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South (which are technically still at war) have improved markedly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed roughly to work to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances, there is no way that we can unilaterally disarm first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and asserted that he was unfit by nature to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, I would call her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and staying speechless as he described his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputation killing" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that she could not get to the Supreme Court because it showed that she had prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in office and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: If you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you're not fit to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court that you're in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions Kavanaugh might pass against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to walk into a courtroom and still wait for us to say, 'Look at that!' " Pelosi said.
And women need to exercise it.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can't kick it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, is it?"
She continued: "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique where when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm upset".
And then, it would go on.
It seemed brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I started to cry with indescribable rage, was that a taller woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always given me a slight scare, and led me down the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and that they will comfort you if they come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bids.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and was pulled from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Brancaneves and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was so advanced, he was running behind on fundraising, so he vowed not to run for president unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters instead of delegates, and anger at the sexism that existed - that left her speechless.
"You'd think she'd had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my headstone?
"Did you?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the war is far from over, a distance between the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with the imposition of new tariffs affecting the equivalent of $200 billion, taxing half of the items coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has counterattacked each time in the same way, most recently raising tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to emulate the US measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will remain unchanged in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to give in to their demands, but to publicly bend to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would appreciate any help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National club located on the outskirts of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive loss to the United States on European soil and leads to no Ryder Cup wins in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most battle-hardened during the tournament, sent the ball into the water on the 16th hole of the par 3, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has excelled in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 record since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European player with the most tournament wins, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I'm happy to have been able to help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the trophy to fellow American John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in Sunday's singles match.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's an odd statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 majors, ranking just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to stay on the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
United States captain Jim Furyk stated after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning for a moment they put the Europeans in trouble.
We fight.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll get ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior".
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the most recent report from the Florida Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation Commission, there is an overall reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the committee, we are seeing increasingly unequal outcropping conditions in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles (130 km) from the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Concentrations can be found 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide was also found in Pasco County.
We reported the presence of mid-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, bottom and high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, bottom and high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, bottom and middle level concentrations in Charlotte County, bottom and high concentrations on or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation are reported to be continuing.
No such case has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
