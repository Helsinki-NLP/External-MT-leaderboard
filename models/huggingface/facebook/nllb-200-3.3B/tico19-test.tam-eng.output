The rapidly increasing sequence of events of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The gradual occurrence of the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom has ensured that the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying degrees of severity depending on each country, is progressing rapidly across all countries, with a consistent pattern of occurrence.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries should increase the preparedness of hospitals and intensive care units to handle the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care, especially in health care.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the illness caused by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 was named as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
According to the evidence available to date, approximately 80% of individuals infected with COVID-19 had moderate illnesses, i.e., respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these recovered.
In about 14% of the cases, COVID-19 becomes an additional serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develops a serious medical condition requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, comparing them with Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current COVID-19 case count in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with the current case count in Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Following China, COVID-19 has spread further geographically and the pattern of COVID-19 infection in the rest of the world is now similar to that in this country.
On 11th March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were those who returned to France from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 has been detected in 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, resulting in 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and the same date, of which Italy alone has 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
The COVID-19 infection numbers and sequence of events are being obtained.
The only official information on reported COVID-19 infection numbers is the information received from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Ministry of Health of each country globally, national and regional health authorities and WHO, which is updated daily at 8 am.
The data was used to estimate the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with the trend in Italy.
In response to the current COVID-19 outbreak, we calculated the 14-day rapid overall incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8 am on 15th March 2020, we have provided a multiple of cases per country compared to Italy for the period 31st January - 15th March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The 14-day rapid overall trend of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom followed the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
The gradual increase in COVID-19 transmission to the EU/EEA as a whole and the UK started on 21 February and accelerated on 28 February 2020 (subject).
This is due largely to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown similar upward trends in subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 (sub-categories).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom as compared to Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
As of 8am on 15 March, comparatively, Italy had already recorded the number of cases, just three weeks earlier or earlier than 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Looking at the overall trend of COVID-19 related events, the epidemic is progressing relatively fast in all countries.
This is despite the fact that different countries are at different stages, different national public health processes, different definitions of infection in different countries and different procedures including rapid testing to select patients for testing for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and in the media, reports emerged that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had reached capacity.
Data on COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital and/or intensive care units are currently available at the EU/EEA level at 6% and 1% respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to support ongoing surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and deaths.
The biggest disparity in the availability of beds for intensive care and intermediate care in Europe was found in a study conducted in 2010-11, with a rate of 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 in 2010-11).
The sixth update on the ECDC Rapid Deficit Assessment for COVID-19 was provided for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom, where the risk of patients exceeding the number of beds in intensive care units is estimated to be 90% higher than the number of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the context of the health care capacity density sampling.
The European Union/European Economic Area countries and certain parts of the United Kingdom have historically been affected by clusters of disease, and as it is customary for hospitals and intensive care units to serve the regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available in the Border Area Designation System 2 (NADS-2) format for statistics.
The experience from Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the prolonged community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increased number of COVID-19 cases that will require health care, especially intensive care, as has been the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the latest ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a shift from containment to mitigation approach is necessary to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to implement a proactive and all-inclusive approach, which if not implemented in a timely manner, will result in an expected rapid increase in the number of cases, with insufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and respond to the situation and take appropriate action.
The Rapid Risk Assessment lists the public health measures and mitigation of the impact of the pandemic.
There is a small window of opportunity, and the potential for countries to use it to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce the strain on the health care sector, and further increase containment efforts.
Failure to do so could result in a dramatic increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks for healthcare systems in the EU/EEA.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed 3,000 people, infected 80,000 others, and caused catastrophic human deaths in China and other parts of the world.
Like SARS-CoV-2, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have spread from worms and may produce similar symptoms in a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly emerging research topic.
We will look at the basics of epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathogenology, diagnosis, treatment, cure, prognosis and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this survey will help us understand and eradicate the menacing disease.
The Spring Festival on 25th January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors for the entire holiday season and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
The characteristics of the virus are similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As on 2nd March 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has reached 80,000, of which 40,000 patients have been discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"COVID-19 is the 'number one common enemy' that the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned is more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report was published on 7th January 2020 on the sequencing of the virus from various patients, more than 200 papers have been published on the pathogenesis, bacteriology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
The review seeks to summarise the progress of research in a new and rapidly developing subject of study.
Whenever possible, we try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other coronaviruses, and to the Middle East Gastroenteritis Syndrome (2012 outbreak).
We will discuss what we have learned so far on prevention and prediction of disease impact and the remaining urgent questions.
As about 15% of common cold are caused by parasites, coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans.
However, in this century, we have faced two highly contagious human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started in early stages in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and spread to many other countries, causing severe illness and death.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in the recorded history of mankind.
The outbreak of unknown pneumonia was first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 as shown in Figure 1.1.
Seven days later, the sequence of Covid-19 was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and other countries.
On 20 January, a case was reported among healthcare providers, indicating the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, Wuhan was completely sealed off and all public transportation was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 infected patients, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site where the outbreak began from an unconfirmed animal.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and nearly 50 countries around the world (Figure 2).
The final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined as the environment is changing rapidly.
Further new data on the epidemic have been released in the following examples from various central studies of 8,866 patients including 4,021 COVID-19 positive cases as on 11th February 2020 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but the primary victims are people aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over 50 years of age, with very few under 20 years of age, and only 14 of infected individuals were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 is more commonly infected in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has primarily spread in Hubei and the surrounding areas.
It took an average of 5 (2-9) days for diagnosis from the onset of COVID-19.
The average interval between symptoms is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from illness to death was 9.5 (4.8 - 13) days.
The baseline reproductive number (R.0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the modified R.0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected before 23 January 2020 spread rapidly, coinciding with the pre-Spring Festival mass movement in China.
The mortality rate among the confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the modified mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (men), age (60 and above) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses belong to the subfamily of the large and single-stranded pathogenic virus of the sensory ribosome (RNA).
They can be divided into four types, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha-CoV and beta-CoVs have been shown to be infectious in humans.
The spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and typeptidal peptidase 4 (TPB4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, followed by membrane binding.
The pathogenic RNA is released into the nucleus; after the pathogenic genome is copied, the envelope forms a capsule containing a mature pathogen containing the genetic RNA with a glycoprotein and a protein-free subunit, which binds to the cell and expresses the virus.
The first genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% among 10 sequence-matched samples collected from the seafood market in Wuhan, the original site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the convective electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the fish membrane of human airway excrement.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds only weakly to the human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2, coincidentally matching the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV-2.
A modern small protein encoded by ORF.3b and a secretory protein encoded by ORF.8 can also be produced.
ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may play a role in the pathogenicity of the pathogen and may inhibit the expression of IFN-beta; however, ORF8 has no known active domain or pathogen.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues combined the amino acid transcript P0.AT1 with a full-length human ACE2 subthermal electron microscope structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å.
The opening and closing epithelium was integrated into the bifurcated membrane. Further, the ACE2-B0AT1 membrane combines two S proteins that are both essential for identifying CoV and the source of infection.
B.0.AT1 (B0AT1) is a potential therapeutic target for the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Start and intermediate bearing
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were known to have been transmitted to humans via wild cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing the evolutionary lineage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other CoVs, it is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 originally lived in bats, as the new pathogen is 96% identical to the two SARS-like CoVs from bats, VWAL-SL-CoV-ZX45 (SL-bat-CoV-ZX45) and VWAL-SL-CoV-ZX21 (SL-bat-CoV-ZX21).
However, the host that transmitted the virus to humans across the ethnic barrier is still unknown, and the route of transmission is unclear.
Ji and others have proposed that the virus may have been transmitted from whales to humans by snakes due to similar recombination of their S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that the most commonly used form of Chinese traditional medicine, the long-snouted, ant-eating mammal, the ant, may have carried SARS-CoV-2 because the coronavirus identified in the ant is 99% genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is 99% identical.
However, a 1% spread between two sets of genes is still a large difference; in this case, we are still waiting for reliable results from the definitive sources (Figure 33).
Much is still unknown about the physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in dry outdoor environments and up to 5 days in environments with 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have had similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be susceptible to ultraviolet radiation and exposure to temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxide acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents actively inactivate the pathogen, but chlorhexidine does not.
The entire human population is immune to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore vulnerable to the novel pathogen.
At present, no detailed studies of immunological effects related to SARS-CoV-2 are known to be in progress.
Thus, we can only verify previous studies on other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, when a pathogen infects an infected person, it is first recognized by the infected person's immune system as a pathogen by the presence of pathogenicity-identifying receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, DAL-like receptors (DLR), NOLD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-like receptors (RLR).
The pathogenic agent induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of fibroblasts, and synthetic production of type 1 inhibitor proteins (IFNs) in different ways, which limits pathogenicity and increases the rate at which the pathogen is destroyed by the blood clots of the pathogenic antibodies.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV may help the virus escape the immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the pathogen.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play a key role in the immune response.
CD4+ T cells induce B-cells to produce antibodies against the specified pathogen, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
To help the immune cells, the T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytons, which are called anti-inflammatory cytokines.
However, the coronavirus may induce spontaneous death of the thyroid lymph nodes and inhibit the function of the thyroid lymph nodes.
The immune system and other antibodies, including the co-products C3A and C5A, are also needed to fight the pathogenic infection.
For example, the antibodies from recovered patients disabled MERS-KV.
On the other hand, the immune system is over-activated and releases large numbers of endogenous molecules in the area, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other intestines, and in the worst case scenario, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect older adults with both diseases and pregnant women, due to its group-initial components.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of pathogens or whose immune systems are compromised to be more susceptible to infection than others.
For SARS-CoV-2, the time interval between onset of symptoms is estimated to be 1-14 days, with a minimum of 1-14 days and a maximum of 3-7 days, based on a study of 425 infected people in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 people with the disease found that the average time between onset of symptoms was 3 days, and that it could range from 0 to 24 days.
In a most recent study, the time interval between onset of symptoms in a population of 8,866 cases as described above was determined to be 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The most important task for health officials is to shift the effective period of isolation based on the time intervals when symptoms appear, and by doing so, avoid infected but asymptomatic people spreading the virus to others.
As a general practice, individuals who have been exposed to or become infected with a pathogen usually require 14 days of isolation.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The major and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which may be accompanied by symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, fainting, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or blood clots within a week of infection.
In severe cases, patients developed symptoms of hypertrophic shock, shock of the lungs, metabolic acidification and blood clot mutation.
Patients with symptoms of fever and/or respiratory distress and severe fever, even if no pulmonary disorders are present, should be screened during the initial diagnostic examination.
A population survey in late December 2019 showed that 98% had a fever, 76% had a dry cough, 55% had shortness of breath, and 3% had diarrhea as a percentage of symptoms; 8% of patients required ventilatory support.
Two recent studies, one on a family group and one on a group of individuals who had no symptoms, reported similar findings.
In comparison, a 2012 population study found that the primary symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them, as MERS is more lethal than COVID-19, require ventilation support in addition to COVID-19 patients.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found among MERS patients.
Fever (99%-100), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms in SARS patients, and ventilation was only required in approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As on 14th February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, while the number of confirmed cases globally was 66,576.
By comparison, the mortality rate of SARS by November 2002 was 10% in 8,096 cases.
For Mers, the mortality rate of 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a population survey conducted in June 2012, is 37%.
Previous studies have shown that the R.0 of SARS-CoV-2 was in the range of 2 to 4, while the R.0 of SARS-CoV-2 was higher at 6.47 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23.
Comparisons of symptoms, mortality and R.0 between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a more transmissible potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the other two.
Thus, controlling SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
The onset of progressive transmission occurs occasionally in a family or in a group of people or in a luxury vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a profile such as having traveled to or lived in Wuhan or other affected areas, or having been in contact with individuals or patients who became infected two weeks before the outbreak began.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from the hospital may be re-infected, sending a warning signal to increase the time for isolation.
In the early stage, patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (specifically, lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 patients with COVID-19, a serum with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L, including a platelet count of less than 1×109/L, and high levels of aspartate amino transferase and the presence of microorganisms in the blood were detected.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoprotein in the blood, and most patients had increased levels of C-reactive and hemoglobin in the blood.
In the critically ill patients, the blood had a high level of the anticoagulant T-two and a very low urine cholesterol.
In most COVID-19 patients, abnormal breast imaging has been found and there have been bilateral spotting shadows or opacities in the lungs.
Patients occasionally have atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis actively compromise the gas exchange.
Type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes decrease the level of circulating air and increase the volume, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, poor chest X-ray findings sometimes indicate the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the loss of lymphocytes, exogenesis and interstitial fluid infiltration of tissue.Also, multiple embryonic cells with multiple subunits in the lungs of the deceased patient, as in SARS and MERS patients, confirmed the presence of the pathogenic infection and the pathogenicity of ARDS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 via Reverse Transcriptome Proliferation (RT-PCR) has been used as a key step in confirming the COVID-19 infection.
However, due to the false-negative rate, it may increase the infectious disease, and as of 13 February 2020, hospital outbreaks in China used diagnostic methods (not relying on RT-PCR alone).
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
However, information about pre-existing diseases, tissue exposures, laboratory tests and radiological findings are essential and mandatory for a correct diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Shang team described a method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based technology, wherein synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using a depth-of-field test of 20 × 10-18 μl/l to 200 × 10-18 μl/l (with 10-100 copies per μl in the intake) in less than an hour, without the need for extensive instrumentation.
It is believed that if confirmed in clinical models, the new technology could dramatically improve sensory capacity and comfort.
Due to lack of experience with novel CoV, doctors mainly provide auxiliary care for COVID-19 patients while trying different types of treatments that have been used or proposed as treatment for other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other pathogenic diseases. (Table 2)
Antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support are currently the most promising treatments available.
The plasma of the recovered patients was rejected before it was used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibiotics and vaccines against the pathogen.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs and may also, to a lesser extent, other organs such as the endocrine system and kidneys, which release ACE2.
However, respiratory distress or inability to breathe is a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and to preserve life, including general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, inductive ventilation and inductive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe autoimmune disease should be supported with adaptive cardiopulmonary bypass (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat patients at risk of heart attack or respiratory arrest.
In addition, maintenance of electrophoretic equilibrium, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and shock, and preservation of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cytokine cycle has been shown to be the result of an overactive immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of bulking inflammatory response that releases a sequence of cytokines including DNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and MCB-1.
These receptors stimulate immune cells to release large amounts of endogenous molecules, which are the main cause of ARDS and other organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine strains, especially in the treatment of critical patients.
Proton and IL-6 antibodies are being used to treat cytokine storm with the antigenic drug daxilzumab.
Other therapies for immunosuppression include: modulation of the immune response driven by T-receptor; inhibition of IFN-gamma, IL-1, and DNA; inhibition of JAK, flip-flop; inhibition of cytokine signaling 4; and inhibition of HTAC.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not effective due to severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
The answer is that they can cause serious side effects, particularly the destruction of bone tissue without blood flow, and can greatly affect the prognosis.
However, it is recommended that life-threatening COVID-19 patients be given a short-term, at least moderate dose of fluoroscopy.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of the sedative-acid-based remdesivir series has been found to have a positive effect in one US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel class of antibiotics originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of infections caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also exhibited the ability to suppress other single-stranded RNA pathogens, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, GILIT has provided China with a joint kit to conduct tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the results of which are highly anticipated.
In addition, parasitinib, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/retonavir and ribavirin are recommended as standard treatment for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other undesirable effects may occur following administration of combination therapy with LOBINAVIR/RIDONAVIR.
Interaction of these therapies with other medications given to patients should also be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production from recovered patients.
There is a long history of the practice of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a disease and treating other patients who have the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
In fact, patients who recovered had higher levels of antibodies in their blood compared to the pathogens.
Antibodies are antibodies (IGs) produced by B-adenomas to fight disease organisms and other foreign organisms. They identify and directly disable unique molecules in the disease organism.
Based on this, plasma of blood collected from a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 was administered to 10 patients in critical condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and their inflammation and pathogenicity burden decreased, and their blood bioxin saturation improved.
However, as specific treatments have not yet been developed, confirmation and clarification is required before large scale proposals are made.
In addition, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should also be carefully considered.
For example, other antibodies may over-stimulate the immune response and produce the cytokine-releasing syndrome, which can be life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma to treat life-threatening patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and manufacture specific antibodies to combat a global pandemic quickly enough.
Thus, extracting B-cells from cured patients, detecting the genetic code of a beneficial antibody or detecting antibodies against the essential proteins of the pathogen is more necessary and practical.
In this way, we can increase the production of other chemicals immediately.
TCM has been used to treat various ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, the effects of a formula depend on the combination of the various components, which may vary depending on the principles of TCM and the diagnosis.
Most of the elements that could be of use are unknown or unclear because such elements or their positive conjugates are difficult to isolate and confirm.
As there is currently no effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is the main alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or recovering from severe conditions.
For example, Shu Feng Zi Do capsules and Lian Hua Xing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In China, recovery rates were highest in several provinces including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Henan (50%) where TCM was used on 87% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is a very rough comparison as many more influential factors such as the number and severity of patients need to be considered in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Foli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone and combined treatment of TCM with WM.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, symptom disappearance and hospitalization was less for the group given traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine than the group taking Western medicine alone.
Most strikingly, the rate of symptom exacerbation (symptomatic progression from mild to severe) is significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM should be assessed in a larger scale and in more centres in well-controlled environments.
It is also interesting to elaborate on the mechanistic properties of the actions and to explain the beneficial components of the TCM treatments or, if possible, their compounds.
Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 often experience a greater fear of highly contagious or even fatal diseases, and people in isolation experience boredom, isolation and anger.
Additional stress and depression can also be caused by adverse effects such as fever, oxygen deprivation, cough, and infection-related symptoms, and insomnia caused by cardiac steroids taken during treatment.
In the early stages of SARS transmission, there were reports of widespread mental health effects, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic disturbances, psychotic symptoms, delusions, and suicidal ideation.
As part of public health measures in response to the spread of COVID-19, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine may lead to greater anxiety and guilt among people about the consequences of infection, isolation and the risk to their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having the disease and people in contact with them, and to the general public in need.
Psychological support should include interdisciplinary mental health teams, clear exchanges and treatment plans with continuous and accurate updates on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of professional electronic tools and apps to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to intercept the chain of transmission from the animal population and infected humans to others, and antimicrobial therapy must be carried out to control the emerging pathogenic infectious disease.
Efforts are underway to develop S protein-based vaccines that will provide long-lasting and inactivating antibody and/or immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
A vaccine that eliminates the direct effect of SARS has been tested in animal models.
However, the potency of the vaccines on the elderly and dying specimens and their protection against animal-derived pathogenic infections still needs to be determined before clinical studies can be initiated.
This is because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago, and there has been no new outbreak since then.
Conversely, MERS continues to occur in the Middle East in individuals and groups, and spreads to other regions due to the presence of animals in the infected areas.
Drug strategies for the prevention of MERS have been developed using inactivated pathogens, DNA plasmids, microorganisms, nanoparticles, pathogen-like particles, and hybrid protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) for individuals who are immunocompromised is an urgent and important task in controlling the current pandemic.
However, due to the long timeframe (on average 18 months) for vaccination and the variations in the morphology of coronaviruses, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty.
As a brand new disease, COVID-19 has just begun its full clinical journey through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without adverse reactions.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality rate in severely ill patients.
Therefore, developing a disease prediction model is essential for healthcare agencies, especially in resource-poor areas, to prioritize their services.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in predicting the recovery of SARS, and the same is true for COVID-19.
As described above, in a study of 8,866 infected individuals, COVID-19 primarily affected people aged 30-65 years, with 47.7% of the population over the age of 50.
Patients requiring intensive care had both pre-existing illnesses and complications, and were significantly older than those not requiring such care (median age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age was a factor in making a prognosis for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 is more prevalent in males (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000) than in females.
Two diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive treatment may suffer from acute cardiac dysfunction and hematoma.
Heart attacks have been the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes and thus cause liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It is also worth noting that there is a strong link between age and chronic diseases, and that they can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: The level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of tissue damage or tissue distress and is proposed as a predictor of disease, response to treatment and ultimately recovery.
The correlation between the level of CRP and the prediction of severity and recovery from COVID-19 is proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHD), aspartate amino substituent (ASD), alanine amino substituent (ALD) and creatine kinase (CK) can help predict the results.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Thus, they are the traditional marker for heart or liver disorders.
Major clinical symptoms: Transient progression of breast radiography and clinical symptoms, effects and complications of COVID-19 should be considered along with other issues of prognosis.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used as adjuvants to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage during infectious diseases.
Since the widespread use of high doses of protease inhibitors on acute SARS patients, many of the disease's survivors have suffered lifelong disability and poor quality of life with the destruction of bloodless bone tissue.
Thus, short-term short-dose steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients if needed.
Stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 outbreak have experienced unusual stress due to prolonged isolation and extreme insecurity and witnessing the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is imperative that these patients receive counseling and long-term support to recover from the trauma and return to normal life.
The demographic studies conducted so far have shown that the origins of COVID-19 are different from those of SARS.
The respiratory rate multiplies with respiratory rate, and SARS-CoV-2 multiplies with respiratory rate efficiently. In the early stages of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause the common cold, the rate of infection is low, or it is asymptomatic.
Therefore, infected patients may produce high levels of pathogens during daily activities, either at an early stage or at the time of onset of symptoms, making it difficult to control the spread of the infection.
However, most transmission was not thought to occur in the early stages, with transmission of SARS-CoV occurring when patients were in serious decline.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is even more severe and more difficult to contain than the SARS outbreak.
In the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, effective efforts have been made, including a general lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these activities are causing severe damage to the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, indicating that the epidemic is contained.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March and the recovery period will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not so confident.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which is more transmissible than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini et al. established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that two-thirds of the world's population would be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in the mid-clavicular and throat swabs of patients who had been discharged from hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly discovered pathogen could be circulating in the same way as the common cold.
However, there are some encouraging signs in China in terms of the decline in the number of new infections, indicating that current strategies are working.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would infect one million people and kill half a million.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to become less virulent and eventually become extinct, or to become a less pathogenic pathogen that can persist in humans.
A comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted through coughing and sneezing, and there is also the possibility of transmission through direct contact with infected objects.
The virus has also been detected in the faeces, raising the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 infected people found that 41% of the cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers, may have been infected by hospital disinfection.
Thus, special precautions must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients and those who are on the side of people who have been infected.
First line of defense to reduce the risk of infection, wearing face masks, and the use of both surgical masks and N.95 respirators (line # 1860S) can also help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks avoid the fluid droplets in the environment where the pathogen can travel through the air from an infected person or attach to the surface of objects and be transmitted to others.
However, only N.95 (sequence # 1860S) masks provide protection against inhalation of small mature pathogens of 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of mature pathogens are fully penetrating; the scale of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, both with an average of 85 nm.
Since particles can pierce five surgical masks stacked together, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N-95 (Series #1860S) masks, not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health-care providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to the pathogen.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes of individuals.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was found to have contracted SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N.95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Healthcare providers should also wear face masks or goggles while working with patients.
It is strongly recommended that all members of the public in areas that are affected or likely to be affected take measures such as washing their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, self-isolate and stay indoors and minimise contact with individuals who may have been infected.
Three feet is considered the safe distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These activities are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection while avoiding the spread of the virus.
Despite the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a new pathogen in humans, its extreme structural similarity to SARS-CoV-2 should have created a high state of alert in China, based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak, as reported on 7 January 2020.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control had been reassuring citizens that the new virus was less contagious, could only spread from human to human, and that prevention and control of the disease was not a problem.
The information relaxed public alarm, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, and the crucial moment to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Disease control agencies in China can take these hard lessons and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful in making public announcements as every word is taken into account by the citizens and can change their mindset and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information coming from hospitals rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) seek to contain the epidemic with extra restraint at an early stage without trying to reassure the public; and (4) provide specific and periodic training to increase public awareness of the epidemic and to test the resilience of the society.
The spread of COVID-19 caused by the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in late December 2019.
At the time of writing, in less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
The virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are similar between SARS and COVID-19 and the spread of COVID-19 has created the impression that SARS is coming back.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are essential to controlling the spread of the disease and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger individuals, men more than women, and older individuals have a higher incidence and mortality rate than younger individuals.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even though they are asymptomatic, whereas SARS patients only spread the virus if they are severely ill, making it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, routine RNA tests for SARS-CoV-2 have shown negative results.
On the other hand, the test may be positive again in recovered patients.
These findings could dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With such rapid progress in COVID-19 related research, several key issues remain unresolved.
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the 96% genetic overlap between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses, we have not yet been able to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is from the bats.
What was the intermediary species that caused the virus to spread from the original wild boar to humans?
Without the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the spread will resume at any time.
Molecular models and biochemical assessments have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the pathogen enter the airway cells and undergo the subsequent pathogenic mutations?
Does the virus bind to ACE-2-releasing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the pathogen genetically change when it is transmitted to humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or recur periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it will take some more time to answer the above and many more questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the spread of this pandemic as quickly as possible and return to our normal lives.
The origin of animal-borne infection of human coronaviruses (HCoVs)
For thousands of years, coevolution, mutation and adaptation has been taking place between coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as the common cold.
The severe outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have revealed how devastating and life-threatening the human coronavirus infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has re-focused attention on the coronavirus and its high transmissibility but at the same time low morbidity compared to its sister virus, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is zoonotic and it is useful to understand the zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, which are not pathogenic.
Some human coronaviruses have also been found to be intermediate hosts.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications in preventing disease in humans.
Studying the interactions between coronaviruses and amphibians in animals may provide important insights into the pathogenicity of coronaviruses in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge focused on seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs), their discovery history, and their zoonotic origin and interspecies spread.
Importantly, we compare different human coronaviruses (HCoVs) from a perspective of the evolution of the pathogen and genomic recombination.
The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this section.
In addition, the requirements for successful ombuvirine mutations and the effects of pathogen evolution on disease severity are outlined.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of cold, positive-energy, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The largest genome of RNA viruses, with 26 to 32 kilobases, was called a "coronavirus" because of its crest-like morphology, which is visible under an electron microscope.
Structurally, coronaviruses have non-differentiated genetic lines that share a similar structure.
In the genome, about two-thirds of the sequence consists of two large, overlapping transcript sequences (overlapping open reading frames (ORF1A, and ORF1B)), which are translated into the 'replicase' polymorphisms, BP1A and BP1AB.
These polymorphs are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, denoted by the NSP 1-16 symbol.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), sheath (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Each lineage has unique subproteins encoded by different lineage-derived coronaviruses.
In terms of protein sequence variation, coronaviruses are classified into four (alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus, and delta-coronavirus), of which beta-coronavirus types contain most of the human coronaviruses, and are further divided into four genera (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and bats serve as the genetic source of most alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main source of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have continuously crossed ethnic barriers, and some of them have evolved into important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus variants have been identified.
The two most common types of human coronavirus are human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) which are alpha-coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus-HCKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) commonly cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections, which are relatively more likely to affect patients with acute respiratory tract syndrome (ARDS) and patients with pulmonary anomalies.
The first human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of people with measles in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected on human coronavirus E229 (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) through extensive studies, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, until the SARS outbreak, it was widely accepted that infection by human coronaviruses was generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, affecting more than 8,000 people and claiming the lives of about 10% of the population.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a series of epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula, and it spread widely to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), renamed SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world must prepare for an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven human coronavirus (HCoV) types are zoonotic, meaning they originated from bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Various lines of evidence support the evolution of all human coronavirus (HCoV) from bats, in which the pathogens are well adapted and nonpathogenic but show high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented China and the world with enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges.
Tracing the animal origin of human coronavirus (HCoV) provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and factors controlling the spread between species.
This may guide or facilitate the search for what are the host, intermediate and reproducing animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 with important implications in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent pathogens of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are generally non-pathogenic in their natural host hosts, but become pathogenic in new hosts after interspecies transmission.
We also review the evolutionary trend of the Human Coronavirus (HCoV), which shows that as transmission increases, infectivity decreases.
The implications of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are discussed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have only been known to exist since the late 1930s.
Before the isolation of human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-2214) strain B814 from the nasal swabs of patients with normal nasal swabs, different coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat, and dog.
In the past decades, seven human coronavirus (HCoV) have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) is illustrative and informative.
The first human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) strain was isolated in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection, and later adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lineages.
Symptoms of the common cold such as headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat are seen in patients infected with human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), with fever and cough seen in 10 ~ 20% of infections.
Later in 1967, human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was isolated from organ culture and pathways in the brains of mice.
Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) has epidemiological features similar to those of human coronavirus HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as circulating A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) are spread globally, and are transmitted in winter in temperate climates.
In general, for these two viruses, the time interval between the onset of symptoms is less than one week, followed by a period of about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with human coronavirus-229E developed moderate to moderate jaundice.
Acute lower respiratory tract infection was observed in only a few patients with compromised immune systems.
SARS, also known as "anomalous pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV-infected disease in human history and the causative agent of SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovery
The first SARS case was detected in China's Guangdong province in late 2002.
The SARS pandemic has recorded 8,096 cases with 774 deaths, and has spread to several countries and continents.
Apart from super-spreaders, it is estimated that each infection will lead to approximately two secondary infections, with a symptom onset interval of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus appearing on the 10th day of the illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with muscle pain, headache, fever, malaise and cold, followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests and elevated levels of creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
SARS patients have widespread tracheal lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the trachea, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be affected in these severe infections, usually accompanied by a cytokine turn, which can be especially dangerous for patients with compromised immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open-lung biopsy of a relative of a patient from Indus Hospital who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, the greatest efforts have been devoted to human coronavirus research.
Human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old infant in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
Cholera, bronchitis, influenza, and bronchitis are the second most common types of infection caused by the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63).
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from nasal swabs of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread globally.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses are caused by the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and its peak incidence occurs in summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is associated with an infection of the nasopharynx, also known as the nasopharynx.
In the same year, human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is thought to be associated with an increased risk of severe asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected globally, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to cause highly contagious diseases, although accidents do occur for unknown reasons, as does the rare occurrence of the highly aggressive subtype of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) that was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses (HCoVs) acquire the capabilities to spread efficiently and persist in humans, they become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed infections originated in the Middle East, occasional outbreaks with secondary transmission resulting from close contact with foreigners have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
South Korea had another secondary outbreak of the disease in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by progressive severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients infected with MERS also developed severe renal failure, which is unique to MERS so far in human coronavirus-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed infections have been reported with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly pathogens known to man.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with known association to SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a public health emergency of international concern, and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed globally, with a critical infection mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, 4.2% of the deaths occurred in Hubei, China, compared to only 1.2% outside of it.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Diarrhoea is seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms, and it can quickly progress to severe respiratory tract syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Reports have reported cases of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms, which could be the cause of the rapid spread of the disease around the world.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the six other human coronaviruses reveals similarities and differences between them.
First, the time between onset of symptoms and duration of human coronavirus infection is the same.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trajectory of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs that the community has received (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features commonly seen during infections with human coronavirus (HCoV) that have spread in the community, including significant absence, moderate or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small proportion of those severely infected with COVID-19 are also found to be infected with SARS-CoV, although at a slightly lower rate.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics of two interesting forms of community-acquired human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is less than that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is necessary to verify that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans is decreasing in a phased manner, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies will clarify whether faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role, as does SARS-CoV-2, at least in some circumstances.
It is very interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 will manifest itself as in the case of human coronavirus (HCoV) in the community.
Nevertheless, aspects of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, infectivity, and persistent spread after human exposure, will influence the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four HCoVs that have been acquired by the community, which cause mild symptoms, have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have co-existed well with these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient human coronavirus pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and in humans that have developed severe HCoV infections have been eliminated.
For this to occur, the human coronavirus (HCoV) must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive gene mutations that resist the host control factors.
In this way, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more likely to become fully compatible with humans as it continues to infect more people over a longer period of time.
If it adapts itself, it is difficult to stop the spread to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread in the human population, inducing normal jaundice in immunocompromised humans.
These pathogens do not require animal hosts.
In contrast, the more virulent pathogens, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are not well-suited for humans and therefore cannot be extended to humans.
They need to survive and reproduce in their animal habitats and have the opportunity to move to vulnerable human targets, perhaps via one or more intermediate and replicator hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and to four other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in the community.
At least in the current context, it is as transmissible as the social-binding HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-transmitted human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
We need to see if it can fully adapt to humans and spread to humans without the need for therapeutic or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal origin of human coronaviruses, it may be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, nature, intermediates and host proliferation of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it has a closely related ancestor that shares high similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequence
This ancestor virus usually mutates to fit this host and is not pathogenic to the host.
Similarly, the containment chambers (the hosts) persist and retain the human coronavirus for a long period of time.
In both cases, the host organisms are naturally susceptible and are natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent pathogen.
Conversely, if HCoV is introduced to humans before or around the time of introduction to a new intermediate host, it will not adapt well to the new host and will most likely cause disease.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of multiplication host by allowing the virus to replicate continuously, and then transmit it to humans to multiply the scale of human infection.
If an HCoV virus is unable to sustain its spread in the intermediate host, it will subject itself to end-stage infection.
Alternatively, HCoVs can mutate with an intermediate host and also produce long-term infectious disease.
In this process, the intermediate oil becomes a natural thermal oil.
Epidemiological data has revealed retrospectively that the first known outbreak of SARS has a history of contact with game animals.
A subsequent immunological study indicated that SARS-CoV immunoproteins were higher in animal traders compared to the general population.
Mascots (Pacuma larvata) and raccoon dogs were the first known carriers of SARS-CoV-like pathogens in live animal markets.
This is evidenced by the fact that no further SARS cases have been reported since the killing of all the fungi in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked Pham Phun cats from the wild or farms without contact to live animal markets are mostly negative for SARS-CoV. These masked Pham Phun cats may only act as intermediate multiplier hosts, but not as natural reservoirs of SARS.
In particular, since various animals in markets in Guangzhou have 80% antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, it cannot be denied that many species of small mammals could also have acted as intermediate amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
All of these appear to be end-stage hosts of the SARS-CoV
The search for a natural animal source of the SARS coronavirus revealed the closely related species of the rhinoceros, known as SARS-RRH-CoV HQ3 (Sars R-RH-CoV HQ3), found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV resistant antibodies and the gene sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
It and other coronaviruses of the genus, with the SARS-CoV, have 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity.
These studies have laid a foundation for the new idea that bats are the carriers of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have been identified from bats, but none can be isolated as a living pathogen other than a single WIV1 (WIV1).
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1, derived from a bat fecal sample, has been shown to be used as a receptor for cell entry by the cat, civet, and human ACE2.
Interestingly, the saliva of a patient with SARS who had recovered was able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in whales, sharing 95% sulfuric acid sequence homology.
Despite the high similarity between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis teams have reported that MERS-CoV is similar to the same group as the Waffle CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5.
Both the Waveval coronavirus-HK4 and the MERS-CoV use the same omnivorous receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for pathogen entry.
The beta-corona virus from the European and African populations identified are genetically closely related to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative, the wild-type coronavirus HKU25 (CoV-HKU25) share only 87% sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not be immediate hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that camels are as immunocompromised to MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
A living MERS-CoV, similar to the one found in humans, has been isolated from the nasal cavity of monkeys, indicating that camels serve as the true host of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have generally mild symptoms but very high exposure.
Infected camels transmit the pathogen not only through the respiratory tract but also through the feces, which is the main route of transmission to bats.
However, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that have MERS-CoV are suggested.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% sulfuric acid affinity with the coronavirus RATG13, which was isolated from Rhynophobus afinis wafers.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is small enough to cause a parental relationship.
This means that bats cannot be immediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) unless near-identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
Indirectly, the wildlife species sold and killed at Huan's seafood wholesale market must have had intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with which many of the early cases of COVID-19 are associated, indicating an animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on viral genomic sequencing have suggested that a group of dangerous small mammals known as the anteater ants (Manis javanica) may also carry ancestral beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
This novel ant coronavirus genome shares 85-92% sulfuric acid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 with about 90% identity in the level of the citric acid sequence.
They belong to two sub-types of SARS-CoV-2-like pathogens in the genomic tree, one of which shares a very similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and RaTG13 are very different, although at the genome level with the highest sequence similarity.
An earlier study on diseased ants reported the detection of pathogenic contingencies from lung samples, which are associated with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
This study used different sequencing methods and genome sequencing to produce a partial genome sequence comprising approximately 86.3% of the full-length pathogen genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct ant origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence difference between the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the ant SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 associated beta-coronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 is to be established in bats, ants and other mammals.
The highest sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and anthrax, with SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 sharing the highest genetic sequence similarity.
It is a good hypothesis that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the beta-coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 related to SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse is driven by selectively mediated convergent evolution.
A third wild animal species has a counter-project for recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a bat.
As a driving force in evolution, the phenomenon of re-infection among beta-coronaviruses is widespread.
The mediator has not yet been included in the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition to the more virulent human coronaviruses, the animal infectious origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-KU1 has been studied.
Ethno-genomic evidence has suggested that both human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus HCoV-229E may have originated from the wavy coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of human coronavirus OC43 and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) have been found in rodents.
A whale coronavirus, Appalachian Ridge coronavirus2, found in the North American black rhinoceros has been reported to show close relationship to human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) is genetically related to another whale coronavirus, known as Hipposiderosis/Canacum/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camels are suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current details of animal origin of known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnomusicological analysis has provided evidence for inter-species transmission events of human coronaviruses throughout history.
The first recorded outbreak of respiratory infection was in 1890, when human coronavirus -OC43 (HCoV-OC43) passed from domestic animals to humans.
The history of interspecies transmission of human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) is unclear.
A closely related virus alpha-coronavirus has been identified as HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpha-coronavirus.
Several sources have proven that the virus is transmitted directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may be able to interact with the voles in a shared environment.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with the apes.
Second, the alpha-coronaviruses associated with human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) are differentially and pathogenically uninfectious in bats, whereas alpha-coronaviruses caused respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-corona virus has not been found in wildlife.
Therefore, bats cannot rule out the possibility of acquiring the human-related alpha-CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogens including rabies, Ebola, Nipah and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoVs act as the gene banks of HCoV-229E, and alpacas and dromedary camels may act as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, as does MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of interspecies transmission from bats to monkeys and from monkeys to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats has been known since its first identification, and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is obvious that the bats act as a convenient storage bank for viral species for gene sharing and zoonotic transmission.
Long life, dense groups, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are favorable conditions for bats to be a good 'pathogen spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into camels for decades.
The virus has adapted well in camels, changing camels from an intermediate host to a stable and natural host.
MERS-CoV is highly moderately pathogenic and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The sporadic spread to humans is an accident.Humans are the terminal host of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its spread.
As opposed to the role of camels in transmitting MERS-CoV, the role of ants in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-coronaviruses of the anteater are more pathogenic in the anteater.
As in the case of SARS-CoV, the fungus may be the terminal host for beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Several potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be demonstrated or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats may be the dormant host of a SARS-CoV-2 related pathogen, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2
Humans may share ecological privacy with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, the SARS-CoV-2-related pathogen may be one of the newly introduced intermediate proliferator and host.
Humans contract the virus by ingesting the meat of slaughter and game animals.
There is a possibility that many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Analysis of other antibodies is required in both domestic and wild animals.
Third, as noted above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in a third species that interacted with bats and ants.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the various animal hosts, three major factors on the pathogenic side help coronaviruses to cross the genetic barrier.
First, their relatively high rates of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-isolated RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average mutation rate of approximately 10 to 4 per year per year per site, which can change to novel hosts depending on the stage of the CoV.
Coronaviruses have bug-spotting exoribonuclease algages, whose deletion results in very high mutation and degradation or inactivation.
Interestingly, the citric acid analog Remdesivir is known to inhibit the coronaviruses by blocking the exorbitant and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the SARS-CoV-2 antivirals to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are a million times higher than their counterparts.
In addition, the rate of genetic mutation is often higher when the human coronavirus (HCoV) does not fit well with the host virus.
Compared to the SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower, indicating a higher degree of adaptation in humans.
In a sense, it's already been adapted to another host that's closer to humans.
In addition, this is not only true for SARS-CoV-2, but also for MERS-CoV, which has been adapted to camels in monosomes.
Theoretically, the gene against SARS-CoV-2 could render vaccines and antivirals useless.
Secondly, the large RNA gene in CoVs contributes additional plasticity in gene transfer for mutations and rearrangements, thus increasing the probability of coevolution of the gaps, which is favorable for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are suitable.
This is supported by a number of unique open reading frames and protein functions coded towards the 3′ end of the gene.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change the prefixes during RNA replication through a unique 'copy-selection' technique.
In the host, which acts as the mixing agent, strand switching often occurs during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
More synchronous full-length and sub-genome RNAs may be able to recombine to form new coronaviruses.
Ethnographic evidence of natural recombination is found in both human coronavirus-HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), as well as in animal coronaviruses such as the SARS-like coronavirus and the bat-CoV-HKU9.
Pathogenic - viral interaction in the context of transmission
In addition to the three pathogenic factors mentioned above, pathogenic interaction with the Ombuiri receptors is another important factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of the SARS-CoV is considered a notable example, which reveals evidence for positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolates of human and feline SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD in the S protein of a coronavirus infection interacts with the biomolecular receptor and is actively selected by the host's immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RPD is present in the S1 fragment at amino acid levels 318 to 510, which binds to human ACE2 and its core receptors for pathogen entry.
The SARS-CoV RPD is capable of sensing ACE2 receptors of various animals, including the bow-whale, the leopard, the rat and the raccoon dog, thus making possible the inter-species transmission of the pathogen.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues appear to differ from human and civet pathogenic extracts in RBD, of which 4 are on the receptor-binding attribute for interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
The strain SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which increases the affinity of the spike protein for the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions are likely to be critical to the pathogen's adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same pathogenicity with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates that the binding interaction of the S protein with human ACE2 (ACE2) in the S1 cell of the S protein may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests a 10 to 20 times higher affinity for this binding than between human ACE2 (ACE2) and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other co-receptors are required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Ironically, the human coronavirus -NL63 (HCoV-NL63) binds to ACE2, but with a different subunit of S.
There are several human coronavirus receptors such as aminopeptidase N for human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43).
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after their animal hosts have been replicated.
The effect of cell receptors on the transmission of human coronavirus (HCoV) is also governed by other omnivorous dependencies and regulatory factors.
The difference in these coat proteins between humans and natural hosts of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) such as bats, monotremes and reptiles may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) must capture pro-hospitalistic factors and reduce the pro-hospitalis control factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this critical area of pathogenic-biological interactions will be identified and characterized.
The use of CRISPR, the state-of-the-art technology, will enable the unbiased genome-wide testing of the Ombuvir dependence and control factors for SARS-CoV-2.
Exposure to novel human coronavirus (HCoV): back to the start
The diversity of the buffalo coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the development of novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs).
In this case, the valve CoVs act as the gene bank of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid gene mutation and gene fusion drive the evolution of human coronavirus (HCoV), and this function serves as two critical steps.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter pathogenic conformations.
In SARS-CoV subproteins, the adaptation of ORF8 to humans is thought to be important, as SARS-CoV-related virus pathogens encode different ORF8 proteins even though isolated.
The 29-nucleotide deletion property of SARS-CoVs has been identified in an isolated strain early in the human pandemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8P and is considered an adaptive gene mutation that promotes the transition of the ombivir (host).
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of resilient fusion with the genotypes of alpha and gamma coronaviruses, with small resilient fragments identified in numerous RNA-RNA polymerases.
Reconstruction sites were identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV infection appears to be cross-species, occurring in monospecific camels in Saudi Arabia.
Recurrent fusion events have been observed in other human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in which human coronaviruses (HCoVs) combine with other animal coronaviruses (CoVs) with their non-structural genomes.
Be aware that artificial selection may contribute to unexpected changes in pathogenic genes, often resulting in the release of pathogens from selective pressures, such as the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) strains due to double citric acid deletion.
Since the non-infective ORF4 is found in the buffalo and camel pathogens associated with human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E), the alpha-coronavirus shows single-stranded acidity, resulting in a phylloidal transformation.
One last point, the evolution of novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) is driven by selection pressure in their host hosts.
Symptomless or mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected by coronaviruses, suggesting a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats appear to be anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pro-inflammatory response by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the anti-reactivity of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and by the low level of exposure of class I molecules containing key contaminant components.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats suppresses coronavirus replication and affects the recombination by exorbitant foetus, thus providing pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic pathogenic mutations when introduced into a new host.
Rearrangement can result in more pathogenic coronavirus mutations, leading to novel proteins or protein features for the adaptation of the umbilical cord.
So, the emergence of three novel human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in the last two decades is not a coincidence.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their host (s) such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong immune response.
Here are the secrets of why asymptomatic pathogens are found and what causes severe infections in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the stimulation of the immune response and cytokine circulation, whereas if the immune response is strong, the pulmonary injury is more severe.
In contrast, in asymptomatic cases, the immune response has been removed from the coronavirus response.
The same tactic of suppressing immune response may be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The anti-pathogenic response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, injection of type I interferon may be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in bats is impaired.
Through this reasoning, it was found that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 is effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although Beta-Cov was found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a Wavelength Coronavirus that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Penguins and other animals in markets have been found to carry pathogens similar to SARS-CoV, although immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Ant-beta-coronaviruses have been identified as analogs to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that ant-beta-coronaviruses may act as one of the intermediate hosts or contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally man-made.
The coronavirus has come back to light recently with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our view of the importance of animal origin and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in human transmission.
There is widespread evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
If SARS-CoV infection develops from interactions between humans and fungi in the market, then the SARS epidemic could be effectively ended by closing meat markets and killing fungi.
Considering the discovery of multiple lineages of ant-virus beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, for the same reason, ant-viruses should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal-borne transmission.
However, how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via ants and other mammals is yet to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been transmitted from camels for decades.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent cases of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these pathogens, new genetic variants may emerge and cause serious disease.
A wide variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating.
In particular, the animal-borne coronaviruses are very different.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, resulting in new coronaviruses that will be more transmissible and/or dangerous to humans in the future.
To reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals that exists in parts of China should be abandoned.
Along with testing for SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a well-prepared response plan.
In fact, many pathogens have been around for a very long time.
They will remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that are favorable for the spread of pathogens, humans can reduce the chance of contact with bats and other wildlife species if they have knowledge about this.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which can be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and possible future infection.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent zoonotic spread of the disease is to keep humans away from the natural habitat of zoonotic pathogens.
Many pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be uncovered.
First, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and ants share the same ecological priority if bats transmit the ancestral pathogen of SARS-CoV-2 to ants.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in the spread of the virus to humans, we need to find out how humans interact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediary ombudsman, it should be clarified how it interacts with various organisms, including humans, bats and ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), both surveillance and testing for infection should be conducted.
If it is a whale, ant or other mammal, it is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen or its nearly identical parent pathogens may be identified in its natural host in the future.
Ongoing reviews in this area clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating of the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 case for suspected and confirmed cases is necessary
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and developed the best reference for fighting this pandemic globally.
Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing through ongoing research and clinical experience, so the strategies and treatments to detect the disease are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment to our guidelines and provided the new diagnostic guidelines provided by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for the detection of 'suspicious case' and 'confirmed case' according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition).
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and has also been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11th March 2020, COVID-19 was identified as a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO).
In the fight against SARS-CoV-2 our team has developed a quick-reaction guideline and it has been published on the Army Medical Review website on 06th February 2020.
It has been attracting a lot of attention since its publication.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing through ongoing research and clinical practice experience, so the strategies and treatment methods for detection are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) published guidelines for the detection and treatment of COVID-19 from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020 contain seven versions, some of which have changed significantly.
Now we have feedback from Xu and others on our guidance, who have introduced a simple assessment scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and has also provided a better platform for the entire world to learn about the pandemic.
We acknowledge and express our gratitude for their remarkable work.
However, their work needs to be updated to reflect the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the infectious component must be linked to two items of the clinical exposure for carrying out an all-inclusive analysis to confirm whether infection has occurred, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, it must satisfy three items of the clinical exposure.
History of infection: (1) have travelled to or resided in Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other community areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) have been in contact with people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (confirmed by a bile acid test); (3) have had contact with other community areas with fever and respiratory symptoms in Wuhan and its surrounding areas or other community areas where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) have been exposed to a large number of people with fever/flu and respiratory symptoms in small areas such as the home, office, school classroom, and 2 other areas where the infection has been confirmed.
Clinical manifestations: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiratory distress; (2) those with signs of COVID-19 infection; (3) normal or low total white blood cell counts or low serum counts at the early stage of transmission.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on the following: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequence showing high integrity to known novel coronavirus; (3) positive to SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody in serum test; or ≥4 times positive in the recovery phase of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or in the severe phase of confirmation.
We can see that real-time PCR tests for the presence of uric acid in respiratory tract or blood samples have been included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions on pathogenicity in blood samples; and the seventh edition on genetic evidence have been added thereafter.
These changes, based on the researchers' work to find the optimal nucleic acid detection tool for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples, including blood samples, increased the availability of different samples and supported the specific antibody positive result in the confirmed criteria.
Besides, there is much more evidence to be aware of with both asymptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
"So, the blueprint of Xu and others to classify people without clinical symptoms as 'at-risk' needs to be updated".
Further, the scoring system should be checked in clinical practice and studies.
We hope that more direct evidence will be presented, and we invite readers to comment.
We recommend that "suspected persons" and "confirmed persons" undergo diagnostic testing, discover and follow the new guidelines in their respective countries.
Our team will update our guidelines for providing assistance from time to time.
Bangladesh has recorded five new COVID-19 deaths in a single day, the highest number of daily deaths.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As on yesterday, the number of cases registered by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh included 114 cases and 33 recovered cases.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online press conference, IETCR director Dr Mirzadi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman died in the accident.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two individuals were over 60 years of age, two individuals were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saipur Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maithri Hospital.
Speaking in a live video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Gwadar, shared that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned until Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown was initially scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
The movement of essential commodities - medicine, fuel and food - is still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were reported on March 8 in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them,
As of March 19, all three had already returned.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide
The total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are due to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection, meaning Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said it was one of the few countries that had no coronavirus cases as of Thursday.
As of yesterday, the WHO recorded 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 new cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10 a.m. on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, and these have been linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus infections were reported in the United States on Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced drastic measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergey Chopyan announced that the city's lockdown has been extended until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will be paid for not going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for another 15 days, and the law passed with 215 votes in favour, ten votes against and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a day, previously, the curfew was in effect only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10pm to 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike Divine has announced that the stay-at-home order has been extended until May 1.
Shops in Australia reduce the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles introduced two-pack and one-pack purchases at all their stores nationwide.
The ALDI on Monday introduced the definition of 'one bag for one'.
The restrictions were posted as news on the outlet's homepage and the chains' Facebook pages.
In case of self-isolation, consumers are known to stockpile due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one package per serving.
The changes follow the previous four-packets-per-transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In its March 8 press release, Coles called the demand "unprecedented" as four packet controls are in place, and "many stores are still selling out within an hour of distribution", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
A Woolworths spokesman said last week's sales had 'increased dramatically'.
Costco's store in Canberra also restricted the allowable amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles not only issued orders for the larger packages held by suppliers but also extended delivery times. Woolworths ordered for additional stocks, while ALDI prepared stocks for the planned Wednesday special sale.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that when retailers are trying to build up stocks, the local council's restrictions on delivery times for the goods make it difficult.
He expects that production costs will rise as suppliers struggle to meet demand, as critical raw materials are in short supply.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that it would not be able to operate the special Wednesday by some stores following the earlier release of stock inventory.
Dr Gary Mortimer, retail business specialist at Queensland University of Technology, told News.com.au that stores are replenishing stocks every night.
He said that toilet paper is a bulky commodity, which leads to low stocks, and then when all is sold, and the wide shelves are all empty, the feeling of scarcity is further reinforced.
"Galls and Woolworths suggest that if there are a lot of items on the storage shelf, such as toilet paper and sanitiser, that [they] can reduce the occurrence of unnecessary fear", Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that it was running out of stock.
Cleenex toilet paper maker Kimberly-Clark and Sorbent maker Solaris say they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a website for home buying and selling, reports that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidders in the auctions in Melbourne. The auctions were held in small numbers because buyers were off for the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of the daily print in Darwin, ND News, included a cut-out, eight-page insert that could be used as toilet paper.
According to a press release provided by ABC Australia on 3 March, the stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said that there is also a high demand for other items including face masks, disinfectants, dry goods, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the trendy UK department store Okado Andrus limited its toilet paper purchases to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday.
"While the term 'pandemic' refers to the extent of a disease's spread, it does not refer to the severity of the specific disease, and therefore the World Health Organization (WHO) has called on governments to take action:"
"All countries can still turn the tide of the pandemic".
"Countries should find, test, treat, isolate, identify and collect their populations", said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"The spread and severity of the outbreak, and the lack of action to combat it, are of grave concern".
According to Dr. Tom Freedman, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a CNN interview in February, he said that 'no other respiratory pathogens, except for the common cold, have been monitored since their emergence until the international outbreak.'
Gebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating, "We have never before seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus".
He said, 'We have never seen a pandemic where everyone can be contained at the same time.'
The new status of pandemic was granted in January following the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. National Director of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""fundamentally, it's going to get worse"."
As of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide stood at 126,000, with 4,600 deaths, the Associated Press reported.
2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is currently affecting.
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. It was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have recovered.
The infection-mortality rate is 4% in China, while internationally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are common symptoms.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from infection to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can take from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antimicrobial therapy.
Initial treatment is symptomatic and tolerated. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from others, monitoring and self-isolation from persons suspected to have been infected.
Authorities worldwide have reacted by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, imposing lockdown, controlling workplace hazards and closing workplaces.
The epidemic has led to severe international socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies due to the rush to buy goods.
Schools and universities have been closed nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been instances of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people from East and Southeast Asia and similar ethnic backgrounds, and other areas with significant levels of exposure to the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased as travel has decreased and heavy industry has closed.
As of December 31, 2019, a large number of people were infected with pneumonia without any known cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020, health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) said.
These patients were mostly from contacts with the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the pathogen is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The pathogen responsible for the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a newly identified pathogen that is closely related to the buffalo coronavirus, the ant ant-virus coronavirus, and SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV). The first known person to have symptoms of the disease was reportedly sick on 1 December 2019, and it was later discovered that the person had no known contact with the meat market.
In the initial batch of cases in December 2019, two-thirds of the cases were identified as those who were in contact with the market.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 reported that the 55-year-old patient from Hubei Province may have been the first patient and that this may have occurred on November 17, 2019.The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on February 26, 2020 that for the first time, the number of new patients coming for treatment outside of China exceeded the number of those coming for treatment in China, as new cases in China had declined but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
There may have been significant underreporting of infections, especially among people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few young cases have been reported, with only 2.4% of cases globally being aged 19 and under.Patrick Vallance, UK Chief Scientific Adviser, estimates that 60% of the UK population will need to be infected with the pandemic before effective herd immunity is achieved.
These are the number of persons tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be tested according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have official policies of not testing people with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that 86% of COVID-19 cases in China up to 23 January were undetected, and these undetected infections spread the disease to 79% of confirmed patients.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March suggested that Italy may have significantly higher infections than explicitly reported.
The baseline estimates of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be as low as 5.7.
Many people affected by COVID-19 are recovering systematically.
For those who do not, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As on 10th April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have occurred due to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of deaths were over 60 years of age and 75% of these patients had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Coronavirus infection is confirmed according to official protocols and deaths are generally counted only in the official count of deaths caused by COVID-19 pandemic.
The actual number of deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who die untested - e.g. at home, in care homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official coronavirus death toll by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know that [the number of deaths] was underestimated", a statement confirmed by a small number of detailed reports in the US. Such underestimation often occurs when infections occur, as happened with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Just before February 28, outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each reported a dozen deaths.
By 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica. Different scales are commonly used to calculate mortality.
The numbers vary over time depending on the region, and they vary by the extent to which the test is performed, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, demographic characteristics such as the time from onset of disease to the present, age, gender, and overall health. The number of patients and the mortality rate are obtained by dividing the number of deaths by the number of patients diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global case fatality rate as of 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated ratio of cases to deaths decreased from 17.3% (those with symptoms as of 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the case-fatality ratio (CFR-CFR), which represents the percentage of patients who die from a disease, and the case-fatality ratio (IFR-IFR), which represents the percentage of those who die from a disease (infected and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and the way to prevent the disease is to follow a specific group of people who have been infected.
Many academic institutions have tried to calculate this number for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the mortality rate during the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range coincides with the results of the first randomized trial for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is asserting that the pandemic is contained.
The peak and timing of the outbreak are uncertain, and may vary by location.
"Unchecked, the transmission typically peaks without any change, and then the contagious host begins to decline to the kitta state", says McGeej Pony of Penn State University.
"But it is almost impossible to make any sensible projections at the moment about when it will be".
"Zhang Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, warned that if all countries could be mobilized to follow the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO) on measures to contain the spread of the virus, 'it will be over by June.'"
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is definitely going to be in circulation, and it will be for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, 'physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is available (which could take 18 months or more).'
'I cannot imagine that the coronavirus will disappear completely because of its rapid spread,' said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, 'and it could become a seasonal disease and come back every year.'
The severity of the recurrence depends on the immunity of the population and the extent of the pathogen's genetic makeup.
Symptoms of COVID-19 are relatively undefined and those who have been infected may still be symptomatic.
Fever (88%) and dry cough (68%) are both common symptoms.
Common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory syncope (fainting), loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, wheezing, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or blue eyes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists difficulty breathing, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and blue face or lips as symptoms of an emergency. If these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended. If the symptoms persist, pneumonia, severe respiratory illness, septicemia (septicemia), septic shock, and even death may result.
The researchers advised that close contacts of confirmed cases should be closely monitored and screened for infection as some of the infected are asymptomatic and without clinical symptoms and have been confirmed as infectious by previous test results.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic rate range from a small to 44% of the population.
Typical incubation period (the time between onset of symptoms) is one to 14 days, usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated incidence of loss of sensation in COVID-19 patients was initially 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is primarily spread by close contact and by small droplets of fluid formed during coughing, sneezing, or talking, with close contact being 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft) away.
Studies have shown that the debris droplets can travel from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) when the mouth is not closed.
Some have proposed that the small droplets that can be released during speech may also be transmitted by the air. Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the airborne droplets can be released during the expiration of breath, including during speech.
Fluid droplets may enter the mouth or nose of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as catheterization and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can spray the tracheal tubes, resulting in the airborne spread of the pathogen.
It can be spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that it could spread through feces, the likelihood of such a risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be spread from faeces to the mouth.The infectivity of the virus is highest during the first three days of onset of symptoms, but there is a possibility of transmission before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of infection.
This suggests that some people have been confirmed to be infected up to three days before the onset of symptoms, and therefore there is a possibility of infection before any significant symptoms appear.
Only a few reports are lab-confirmed asymptomatic infections, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while there is no clear information on how the disease is transmitted, what we do know is that one person can usually infect two to three people, with the pathogen surviving on surfaces for a few hours to several days.
In particular, it has been found that the pathogen can survive on polypropylene and 304 grade steel for up to three days, on cardboard for one day and on copper for up to four hours.
This, however, varies with humidity and temperature.Infection has been confirmed in pets and other animals.
Although there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals, as they may have found contaminated ones after contact with other surfaces.
Acute respiratory syncytial coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel pathogen that was first isolated from three individuals with pneumonia who had come into contact with a cluster of patients with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All features of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are naturally occurring in the associated coronavirus. The pathogen is killed by household soap by dissolving its protective coatings outside the human body. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought that it may have originally spread from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis revealed the presence of the coronavirus, a serpeco virus (genus B) within the genus Beta coronavirus, with two threads derived from whales in the genus genus genus.
It is 96% identical to the other Wave corona virus samples (Wave Corona RTG13) in terms of total genome.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid difference in specific regions of the genome sequence between the virus from the ant and the virus from humans.
The 92% similarity in shared genetic material between the ant coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 in the whole-genome comparison to date is not enough to prove that the ants are intermediate hosts.
The presence of the virus can be tentatively detected on the basis of symptoms, but can only be confirmed by antibody replication multiple transcriptome sequencing (RRT-PCR) in infected sores or by a CT scan.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR to CT suggested that CT showed significantly greater clarity than PCR, although many of the graphical features of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "no CT should be used as a first-stage test or screening test for COVID-19".
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 with the first protocol published on 17 January.
The test uses a multi-step RNA-processing (RRD-PCR) sequencing in real time to replicate the antibody.
The test can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Although throat swabs can also be used, in general, the test is performed on the nasopharyngeal swab. Many laboratories and companies are developing in vitro test systems to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
The teleological test system developed by Celtex is approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories in the United States.
Characteristic graphical features of radiographic maps and radiographs (CT) on symptomatic people include asymmetric surface glass opacities and non-blear fluids.
The International Database of Diagnostic Findings for confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Society of Radiology.
The normal drafting without PCR confirmation is unique in identifying COVID-19 as it is associated with other infections such as adenoviruses.
A large-scale study in China has demonstrated that although the graphical method is less likely to definitively detect infection than PCR, it is faster and more accurate in revealing the results.This suggests that CT may be considered as a diagnostic tool for detecting the impact of infection.
Modifying neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect pathogenicity patterns using both X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on a tissue and then throwing that tissue directly into a trash can.
Those already infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. Many governments have imposed bans on travel to and from all non-essential travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, in most parts of the world, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission.
It is recommended that routine precautions, contact precautions and eye protection be taken when caring for those who may have been infected. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to avoid further spread.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on the use of this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams are working on privacy-friendly solutions, including logging user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth.
Users will receive a text message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are being spread about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and flushing the mouth with mouthwash are useless.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but various organizations are working towards developing one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of infection.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least twenty seconds. In particular, washing after going to the bathroom and returning, or after looking at hands that are dirty; before eating; after blowing the nose; and after coughing or sneezing.
Because outside the human body, the pathogen is killed by household soap, by destroying its defence bubble.
The CDC recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in case of lack of availability of soap and water.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands properly.
Surfaces can be cleaned with a number of solutions including 62.71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% poivoton-iodine (within one minute of disinfecting the steel surface).
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate of crohexetin, are less effective.
CDC recommends that decontamination measures be taken in places where COVID-19 infection is suspected or confirmed, such as office or day care center, office area, toilets, common areas used by infected persons, and shared electronic devices such as mobile phones, touch screens, keyboards, remote drives, cash machines, etc.
Health agencies recommend that people curl their elbows or cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing, and that any tissue be disposed of immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people with the infection, as wearing a mask will limit the amount of droplets and travel distance from the respiratory tract that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a epidemiologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask will reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, as poor hand hygiene is a major factor in the spread of infection".
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-cloth mask for medical use. China has specifically recommended healthy people wear disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone going out in public places wear masks to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering grocery stores to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since March, has mandated that passengers on trains and intercity buses wear masks from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks while traveling, while recommending that those who cannot afford to buy face masks should make them at home.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is the practice of infection control measures that delay the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Measures include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closing of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, cinemas or commercial centres.
Social distancing can be used by individuals staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are mandating or recommending social distancing in affected areas.
The maximum number of people per group recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was reduced from 250 (if a region is known to have no COVID-19 transmission) to 50 and then to 10.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people in public places. The CDC advises that people with chronic health conditions, including the elderly and those with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and weakened immunity, are at higher risk of serious health disorders and complications, and that in communal areas such people should stay at home as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health organizations began to use the term ""physical"" as a response to the term ""social"" or to reduce the target of these interactions to the same level as physical interactions in virtual, social, or remote communities".
The use of the phrase 'social distancing' has led to the assumption that people should be isolated from society entirely, rather than encouraged to interact with each other in alternative ways. Some authorities have even issued sexual health guidelines to be used during outbreaks of the disease.
This includes recommending that if you live with a person who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus, you only have sex with them.
It is recommended that those who have been infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected should self-isolate at home.
Health agencies have provided detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-isolation for the entire population living in affected areas.
Strong self-isolation has been advised for those groups at high risk of transmission.
Persons who are considered to have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region where there is a high incidence of the disease are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their last exposure.
Containment or suppression and mitigation are the strategies to control the impact of disease.
Control measures are being taken in the early stages of the outbreak, with the aim of identifying and isolating those infected, and introducing other measures and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts go to the backstop: measures are taken to reduce the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
Prevention and mitigation can be combined and carried out simultaneously.
More intensive action is needed in the suppression of measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline reproduction rate to less than 1. This is called flattening the plague curve, an attempt to reduce the escalation of plague as part of managing the spread of infectious disease.
This reduces the risk of over-capacity of health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the spread include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, mask wearing, and self-isolation; social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; community engagement to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken various measures to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore has offered financial assistance to those who have been affected and have isolated themselves, and imposed heavy fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan has also imposed fines for the stockpiling of medical products that increase the production of masks. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show mitigation (preventing but not stopping the spread of smallpox) and containment (reversing the course of the epidemic) as major challenges.
Better vaccination policies could reduce peak health care needs by two thirds and deaths by half, but the result would be tens of thousands of deaths and a collapse of health systems.
Measures can be prioritized to containment, but must be protected until the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first), as if measures are relaxed, rapid re-transmission may occur.
The long-term interruption of the pandemic has social and economic costs.
There is no specific antibody against COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop one, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter medication, drinking fluids, and taking rest may help limit symptoms.
Depending on the severity, biotherapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Several compounds previously approved for treatment of other pathogenic diseases are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has also found that some ""traditional and home remedies"" may provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19".
The World Health Organization (WHO) describes capacity building and health adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a basic response to disease.
The ECDC and WHO European Circular Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at multiple levels, including centralising laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, abolishing non-mandatory procedures where possible, segregating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients and increasing intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories as to where the first person to be infected (known as Patient Zero) first became infected.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei gradually increased.
These were often linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. One theory is that the pathogen came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, was of zoonotic origin. A pneumonia batch of unknown cause was detected on 26 December and treated by Hubei Provincial Hospital physician Zhang Zhixian, who reported it to the Wuhan Jiangyan CDC (CDC) on 27 December.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a 'SARS-like coronavirus'.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the World Health Organization (WHO).
In early January, health officials in Wuhan were informed of an insufficient number of undiagnosed pneumonia cases, enough to initiate an investigation. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of patients doubled roughly every seven and a half days.
With the help of the migration that took place during the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is the main transport hub and meeting point, the virus spread to other provinces in China in early and mid-January 2020.
On 20 January, China recorded almost 140 new infections in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people were already symptomatic, according to the latest official data.As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections in the world.As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million infections have been reported globally, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
There were at least one outbreak in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the large spread of the epidemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement between themselves and have established border controls.
National reactions include quarantines (also known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, in the United States were under some form of lockdown, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines in lockdown, about 59 million people in South Africa in lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India in lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, a level that rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - a third of the world's population.
Wuhan had its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on 1 December 2019; another unconfirmed case was reported on 17 November.
A batch of pneumonia patients with unknown cause was identified by Dr. Zhang Zhixian on December 26 and reported to the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27 by the hospital where he worked.
The initial genetic test of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public announcement was made by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed.
'After the announcements were made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan that they had 'spread rumours' about the outbreak.'
"China's National Health Commission initially insisted that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission".
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign, described by the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, as a 'people's war' to contain the spread of the virus".
In what has been described as the "greatest lockdown in human history", a sanitation curfew was announced on January 23 to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city is prohibited.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
Officials announced that the construction of the temporary hospital, Huashenshan Hospital, was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, the Licensing Hospital, was built to handle the additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other facilities such as the convention centers and sports stadiums in Wuhan into makeshift hospitals. On 26 January, the government took additional measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including issuing health notices to travellers and extending the festival holiday in Yaluen.
Schools and universities across the country were closed.
The government has taken a number of measures in Hong Kong and Macau, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work operations were established in many Chinese areas.
Travel restrictions were implemented both inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation has been modified and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
"With the imposition of public curfews in many cities, it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external restrictions. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the pathogen from being 'imported' from other countries".
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.On 23 March, the Chinese mainland had only one domestic case, a traveller who had travelled from Istanbul to Guangzhou and returned five days earlier.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Lee Gechiang stated that the outbreak had been contained and contained at the domestic level.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry permits for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March. There is no specific information on when this policy will be completed.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen, and provided financial incentives to the enterprises. The State Council announced the launch of a day of national mourning with three minutes of silence at 10:00 on 4 April, coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government asked families to observe online physical distancing to avoid the re-emergence of the coronavirus.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on 20 January 2020.
The country's health agency reported a significant spike in the number of confirmed cases on February 20, which was attributed to a meeting in Daegu on behalf of a new religious movement called the Shinseonji Jesus Church.
Shinseongji pilgrims visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of being affected by the spread.
As of February 22, 1,261 people, or 13 percent of the 9,336 people who follow the church, had reported symptoms.
On February 28, Korea had more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
South Korean military bases have been cordoned off after three soldiers were confirmed to be infected.
Flight schedules were also affected, so they were rescheduled. South Korea launched what is considered the largest and best-organized program in the world to detect the spread of the virus among the general population, isolate them if there is an outbreak, and track down contacts and isolate them.
The diagnostic methods include mandatory self-reporting of new international travellers symptoms through mobile app, drive-thru testing for virulence based on results available the next day and increasing testing capacity to test up to 20,000 people every day.
Although not isolating entire cities, South Korea's plan to contain the spread is considered successful. Initially, there were two conflicting opinions in South Korean society regarding President Moon Jae-in's actions in handling the crisis.
Several Korean people signed petitions calling for Moon to be removed from office because of the government's handling of the pandemic, or congratulating him on his work.
On 23 March, South Korea reported its lowest daily cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that all new arrivals from abroad from April 1 would be quarantined for two weeks.

Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to isolate the areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.
Although plans to restrict inter-city travel were announced in March, heavy traffic between cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year's Eve.
The Shia pilgrimage sites in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020.
Amid claims that Iran is masking the scale of the outbreak, more than a dozen countries had identified their infections as originating from Iran by February 28, suggesting that the number of cases may be much higher than the 388 reported by Iran on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its total 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful protest and to release all eligible prisoners temporarily.
The risk of transmission is reported to be higher in all-round closed areas where there is insufficient medical care, such as detention centres.

As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
Throughout March 23, the coronavirus was infecting about 50 people an hour in Iran, and killing one person every ten minutes.
World Health Organization (WHO) officials believe that there may be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It is also suggested that Iran's financial capacity to contain the spread of the virus may have been affected by US sanctions on Iran.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions on countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The spread was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January after two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.

The CNN report pointed out that Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test everyone with the virus to date may have contributed to the high death rate.
The United Kingdom was the most tolerant of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass isolation measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has drawn criticism for its lack of speed and urgency in addressing the concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a notice advising against all non-essential travel and social contact, recommending people to work from home as much as possible and to avoid places such as neighbourhoods, restaurants and cinemas.

Despite doing so, the US was slow to start testing, which at the time masked the true scale of the infection.
The test was marred by the defective test kits produced by the Central Government in February, the lack of Central Government approval for non-Government test kits (through universities, institutes and hospitals) till the end of February and the control criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March.
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has commended the Chinese authorities for their efforts to manage and contain the spread of the disease.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has noted a major shift from the situation during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when secrecy by Chinese authorities hindered prevention and control efforts. During the current crisis, the central government "provided periodic updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
"On January 23, the decision of central authorities to implement the travel ban in Wuhan was taken by the World Health Organization (WHO) representative Gao Doan Khaleya, who said that while it was 'certainly not recommended by the WHO,' it was 'the most important sign of commitment to contain the outbreak in the area where it is most prevalent.' " He added that it was 'an unprecedented event in the history of public health.' " The outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2009, the first time since the outbreak was formally declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in the history of public health, due to the high number of confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission in other countries beyond China and the high number of cases reported on that day.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said, "PHEIC has been announced because of the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries without strong health systems".
Referring to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tetras said that "measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade are unnecessary" and that "the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend reducing trade and movement".
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has appealed to the global community on February 5 for a contribution of $675 million in strategic preparedness funding for low-income countries, underscoring the urgent need to help countries that lack systems to detect those infected with the virus, even if it emerges".
In further statements, Tetros stressed that 'we are only as strong as our weakest link' and urged the international community to 'try today or lose more later.' On 11 February, the WHO established the name of the disease as COVID-19 at a press conference.
On the same day, Tetras said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to 'provide the entire UN system with the power to confront it.'
The result was the creation of the United Nations Crisis Management Group, which will coordinate the information provided by all UN agencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that it will be "helpful to focus on health-related information while other agencies provide their expertise to deal with the impact of the pandemic on broader social, economic and developmental activities".
On 14 February, a WHO-led Joint Working Group was activated with China to assist China in domestic management, to conduct workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions to assess the "severity and transmissibility of the disease" and to conduct a field study to assess the "impact of containment measures at provincial and state levels, including urban and rural settings", and to provide assistance to international and World Health Organization (WHO) experts in the field in China.On 25 February, the WHO stated that "more countries should prepare for the possibility of the spread of the coronavirus", and that countries should remain "prepared" to call it a pandemic, although the time is short.
"In response to the growing epidemic in Iran, the World Health Organization (WHO) sent a joint mission team to assess the situation.On February 28, WHO officials announced that the global threat rating for the coronavirus would be raised from 'high' to 'very high,' the highest level of alert and risk for the outbreak".
'This is a fact-finding test for every government in the world: wake up,' warned Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) health emergency programme, in a statement.
'The virus may be coming, so you have to be prepared,' he urged, adding that the right containment measures would help the world avoid 'the worst of it.'
Ryan said that the current data did not necessitate public health officials to declare it an international pandemic, adding that to do so would mean that 'we are accepting that every human on this planet is susceptible to the virus.'
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) is 'deeply concerned by the alarming levels of transmission and severity and the alarming inaction,'" the Director-General said. "The World Health Organization (WHO) has faced significant criticism for what has been perceived as inadequacies in its handling of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the pathogen as a pandemic".
Part of this backlash was a petition signed by 733,000 people by April 6 calling on the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tetros Adhanom, to resign.
On 26 March 2020, UN human rights experts called for respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several provincial-level CPC executives were sacked for their handling of the isolation efforts in central China, which is seen as a sign of discontent with the party's proliferation-related measures in those regions.
Some critics believe the move was made to protect Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the previous acceptance of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favour of conspiracy theories that the origin of COVID-19 could have come from the US or Italy.
"The US administration of Donald Trump's reference to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"" that China's ""control system has overridden"" a virus that has become a global pandemic has been criticized by some critics as racist and as a ""deviation of his administration's failure to control the disease"".
'The Daily Beast received a US government report that outlined a communication plan from the National Security Council, 'all about China strategy' was quoted in it.
"The message must reach us in any way possible, including through press conferences and television appearances. 'Politico, Foreign Policy and publications such as Bloomberg suggest that China's attempt to send aid to the countries affected by the virus is part of a global propaganda campaign.'
"The European Union's (EU) foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell, warned that 'there is a geo-political element, including the struggle for influence through intimidation and the politics of 'liberty.'"

On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
'The Italian newspaper La Stampa, citing an unnamed 'high-level political source', said that 80 per cent of Russian aid was 'useless or of little use to Italy'.
The source accused Russia of 'geopolitical and diplomatic' self-promotion.
Lombardy President Atillio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the US.
'[Putin] expects that when we offer aid to our American colleagues, instead of the US making medical equipment and supplies, the Americans will return the same aid if necessary,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) 'Defender 2020' military exercise, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a smaller scale in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states.
Kate Hudson, general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public-health crisis, it affects not only the lives of the troops from the United States and many European countries participating in the exercise, but also the lives of the people of the countries where the event is taking place.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to international leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help, saying that his country was being hampered in fighting the spread of the pandemic by the lack of access to international markets as a result of the US sanctions against Iran. The pandemic has also led to calls for the US to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, such as health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high public health allocations.
Political analysts expect it could have negative effects on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
"South Korea has criticised Japan's 'unclear and hostile quarantine measures' following Japan's announcement that arrivals from South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks in government-designated sites".
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's decision to confront the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for a criminal investigation of Moon, one for his response, and one for his response, which they said was based on the government's mismanagement of the epidemic.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those who are believed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus pandemic has caused a number of events that have disrupted supply shortages, the global use of equipment to fight infection, unjustified fear buying over-the-counter and disrupted factory and logistics operations.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in the supply of goods.
Panic buying in many areas has caused a supply shortage, with non-essential groceries such as food, toilet paper and bottled water being wiped out.
The technology sector in particular warned that there would be a delay in export of electronic products.
According to the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tetros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase of up to twenty times the normal price and has caused a delay of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
It has also led to a global shortage of personal protective equipment, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned could put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the epidemic has given a new opportunity to the Taikow merchants to sell Australian goods to China.
The operation was later banned by the Australian government after it caused a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets. Both regions were spared severe food shortages, despite the high COVID-19 impact and high demand for food in northern Italy and the Wuhan region.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and illegal trade of essential products are working successfully, avoiding the severe food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
Industry representatives believe that there is no significant decline in production in northern Italy, where there is significant agricultural production, but that prices could rise.
Even in Wuhan, food shelves were temporarily empty as Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure that the public had enough food to eat.
Italy also has laws that require food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy was felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, as a result of government measures to control the spread of the virus, China's economy was hit hardest in the first two months of 2020 with retail sales falling 20.5%.
As the Chinese mainland is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the spread of the virus is seen as a major threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agathe Demeris of the Economic Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until clarity is gained on the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic downturn caused by the current pandemic would be greater than that caused by the SARS pandemic in 2002-2004.
According to an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the impact on the global supply chain could be more than $300 billion over two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was thrown into a difficult position as oil prices fell sharply due to a decline in Chinese purchasing demand.
Global equity markets collapsed on 24th February due to a significant increase in COVID-19 infections outside the Chinese mainland.
On February 27, due to growing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, various US stock market indices, including the Nasdaq-100 (NASDAQ), the S&P 500 (S&P) index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their fastest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day decline since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices fell by more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, the Scope valuation company GmbH confirmed the sovereign monetary valuation of China, but extended the negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on the coronavirus scare, with the biggest fall occurring on March 16.
Many people think that a recession is imminent.
Economist Mohamed El-Arian has praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and Arassu in a timely manner.
Central banks are reacting much more quickly than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
The tourism sector is one of the sectors most affected by travel restrictions, closure of public places including travel destinations, and governmental advisories against any travel around the world.
As a result, a number of airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the UK's regional airline Flybe has suffered a collapse.
The cruise industry has been hit like never before.
Various ferry stations and ferry ports have been closed.
The outbreak coincided with the Sunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled many events involving large gatherings, including annual New Year celebrations, while private companies have closed their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland independently.
Various New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid large crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple scenes.
Officials in municipalities and districts in 24 of China's 31 provinces have extended the New Year holiday until February 10, advising most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80 of the country's GDP and 90 of its exports.
Hong Kong closed schools and cancelled New Year celebrations until March, when it raised the level of the pandemic response to the highest level and declared an emergency. Retail sales have been affected globally due to reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50-60% decline.
This is a decrease of 33-43% in the number of customers in the sales centres in March as compared to February.
Additional measures such as increased sanitation measures, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers and the cancellation of events were taken by mall operators around the world, according to the assessment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the slowdown triggered by the impact of the pandemic is estimated to push between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty, compared to the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic was at its peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
China's estimated 300 million suburban migrant workers are stuck at home in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus pandemic could cause 47 million job losses in the US and unemployment rates could reach 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (daily wage earners) without jobs. An Angus Read survey found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers were claiming temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers were applying for Universal Credit. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their employees under the government-subsidized short-term work scheme known as Gussaped.
France and Britain follow Germany's short-term unemployment compensation scheme.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of institutions and individuals - both permanent employees and freelancers - globally.
The arts and cultural sector institutions tried to uphold their (mostly publicly funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage to the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and supporting artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions across the world and at various scales are being forced to cancel or postpone or close their exhibitions, events and performances indefinitely.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Religious services, cancellation of important sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and costume shows are another recent and rapidly occurring consequence of the spread of the disease.
The film industry has also been disrupted, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome during the last week of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home safely rather than attending Sunday prayer meetings; some churches offer church services via radio, live streaming or television, and some offer services for worship in a drive-in format.
Following the closure of its churches by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the expulsion of Christian pilgrims from St Peter's Square, other religious institutions such as churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras have also cancelled their services and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak, and later the shrines were closed. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, banned foreign pilgrims and its own citizens from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused significant disruption to global sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season have been cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the IOC announced on 24 March that the event would be rescheduled to a date "beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021". Casinos and other sports venues worldwide will be closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled. "
This has led to a shift of gamblers towards the internet, with many online gambling sites significantly raising their fees for new entrants. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many bands postponing or cancelling their concert tours.
Many of the major theatres, such as the one on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"As an alternative to the traditional live concert format, some artists have found new ways to produce and share performances online, such as live-streamed concerts or creating web-based 'festival' events for artists to perform, distribute and promote their works".
Online, a plethora of coronavirus-themed internet memes have created a sense of humor and distraction for many amid the instability.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a great deal of prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people from China and East Asian heritage, as well as against people from Europe, the United States and other countries most affected by the disease.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February documented the racist sentiments expressed against various groups of Chinese people around the world, who often claim that they are the ones who deserve to be infected, or that this is just punishment, even though most of the impact has been in China.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased in some countries in Africa.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei complained of discrimination based on their ethnic appearance.
In the affected areas, help was provided by China both online and in person.
Following the intensification of the spread to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to have a severe spread of COVID-19, may also be subject to suspicion and racism.Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed petitions banning Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to prevent the onset of the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan is popular on Twitter.
Chinese people in the UK and US, and other Asian people, have reported increasing racist insults and attacks against them.
"US President Donald Trump's reference to the coronavirus as a 'Chinese virus' has been criticised by critics as racist and anti-Chinese".
Buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sad were attacked by Ukrainian protesters.
Students from the North Eastern states of India, which share a border with China, who are studying in other major cities of India, are reportedly being quarantined for the spread of Corona virus.
'The Chinese destroyed nature, ' 'that's why God is taking revenge against them,'' said Dilip Ghosh, the BJP's state committee chairman in West Bengal.
In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese have increased with the epidemic. Foreigners living there have been labelled 'foreign trash' and 'must be thrown away'.
Many newspapers have removed their policy of showing newsletters only to subscribers, and have removed some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers on the disease available for anyone to read.
Scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on some pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its related SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) include methods to detect the presence of the pathogen and other agents produced in response to the infection.
RT-PCR method for detecting the RNA of the coronavirus has confirmed the presence of the virus in the samples.
The test is specific and designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus's RNA.
It is used to confirm the most recent or active infections.
The other is the use of radiology for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Other immunological tests show how many people have had the disease, including those with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country has reliable data on the pathogenicity of their total population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a large variation in the number of people tested across countries.
This variant may significantly affect reported mortality rates, and in some countries may be significantly overestimated.
Real-time retrospective transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to test respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasopharyngeal swab or cochlear swab.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR test, which is done by taking a sample from the throat with a swab, can give a reliable result only in the first week of the infection.
The virus then disappears in the throat, but reaches the lungs and continues to multiply there.
During the second week of the test, the patient may be tested with a suction tube from the lower part of the airway or a cough drop (cough drop) as an alternative sample.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed using the Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RRT-PCR) at the Sarde in Berlin in January 2020, and formed the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK has developed similar testing methods as of January 23, 2020. South Korean company CozenBioTech developed a PCR-based, clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerSec Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
"This refers to the ""E"" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medical Product Administration to use PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing its 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine through the RT-PCR method.
The CDC in Atlanta had a disruption in testing because one of the three previous versions of the test kits produced unclear results due to faulty test materials, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, tests using the two components have not been determined to be reliable, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to conduct tests.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization, and commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting the trials in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced that RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing methods are available across the country as of 5th March 2020.
As on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics has made way for nationwide COVID-19 testing.
No dosage limits have been declared; sample collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with the criteria recommended by the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test system was developed and manufactured by the State Research Center for Toxicology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
The test was registered by the Service of the Confederation Dependent on Surveillance in Healthcare on February 11, 2020. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test system to detect COVID-19 infection. The test system, which is optimized to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period, is the most testable in less than 3.5 hours, meaning that a machine can perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
On March 19, 2020, Abbott was granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Abbott Laboratories to test with Abbott's M2000 system; similar authorization has been previously granted by the FDA to Hologic, LabCorp, and ThermoFisher Scientific.
Sebied received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 21, 2020, for a 45-minute trial.
FDA has approved the test using equothermal imaging technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require alternating temperature cycles, it can provide positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the US, and Abbott expects to increase production to handle 50,000 tests per day. A test method using a single copy antibody that binds specifically to the novel coronavirus' cervical protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan. If successful, it is hoped that it can provide results similar to the Rapid Splicing Test in 15 to 20 minutes.
A March 2020 article commented that "there is a low probability of detection by chest X-rays in the early stages, while CT [CT-computed tomography] results may even show the presence of symptoms before they appear".
Common features in CT include an outward, asymmetrical and backward distribution bilateral multi-mode ground-glass reflector.
As the disease progresses, subplateal holes, a narrowed airway, and a hardening of the airway are formed.
A study comparing PCR to CT at the onset of the current pandemic in Wuhan suggests that, although many of the diagnostic features of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, CT is significantly more accurate than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""neither CT as a first-line test nor a first-line test for COVID-19 should be used"" As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of PCR as a first-line test. "
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in people 7 or more days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance. Assessments can be done in central laboratories (CLT) or at points of care testing (PoCT-POCT).
Many of these assessments can be performed by high-performance automated systems in medical laboratories, but their availability depends on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLD, although series of samples may be used to mimic immune response.
For a PoCT test, a sample of blood is usually obtained by drilling a small hole in the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the pre-assessment extraction step is not required. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 26 March 2020 released the names of 29 companies that are currently certified to distribute their antibody tests as they provide information to the agency on demand.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and EpoDiagnostics, which manufactures test kits that help detect antibody IgG and IgA antigens from blood samples, received European approvals for their test kits in late March 2020.
With the ability to test several hundred samples within a few hours, the pathogen can provide results much faster than the conventional PCR assay of RNA.
They found in early April that none of the antibody kits purchased by the UK were fit for use.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme whereby suspected patients stay at home, "snatch a sample tube that the ER gives to the patient", and return it to the ER shortly after to receive the test results.The British NHS runs a program to test suspected patients at home, thus eliminating the risk of infection to others when the patient arrives at the hospital or reducing the disinfection work if the virus is used.The health professional conducts a DV-speech test for COVID-19 for suspected patients and collects samples using the precautions".
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to carry out more rapid and comprehensive tests than any other country. The mobile system has a capacity to carry out around 12,000 tests a day, and last week 10,700 tests were carried out, the National Association of Legal Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2.
When a doctor orders a medical examination, the costs are covered by the health insurance company.
According to Robert Koch, the head of the company, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, vehicle-to-vehicle tests were being offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany is unknown as Germany only reports the number of positive test results.
In the first laboratory study, 33,491 samples (6.9%) of 483,295 samples tested up to and including the 12/2020 calendar week, had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Researchers from Denia and Rambam Hospital, Israel, developed and tested a method to simultaneously test samples from 64 patients, which can only be tested if a combined sample is found positive. A temporary 2,000 square metre "hub-ion" (Chinese: 火眼, not "I-Eye" in English) in Wuhan was opened on 5 April 2020 by the Biomedical Diagnostics Laboratory (BGI) to collect 10,000 samples.
The sampling methodology shows that if the test system developed in 5 days under the direct supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian had not been implemented, the number of patients in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of overcoming the isolation would have doubled.
Hu-Yan laboratories in a total of 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, have been systematically following the work of the Wuhan laboratory.
By March 4, 2020, the daily capacity is a total of 50,000 tests per day. Open-source, multiplex designs published by Origami Assessments have been released that can test 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 assessments. These uniform designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid handlers.
By March, shortages of test material and insufficient stockpiles were preventing large-scale testing in the European Union, the UK and the US.
This led some creators to explore the protocol of preparing samples by heating them to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for testing.The United Arab Emirates is testing its population at a higher rate than other countries and is on the path to increasing testing to cover a large portion of its population, it was announced on 31 March.
"This is being done by acquiring a drive-through facility and a population-based high-performance laboratory (based on the 'Hu-Yan' emergency diagnostic laboratories in China) from Team42 and BGI".
The laboratory, built in 14 days, has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory operating outside China with such a capacity globally.
Different test procedures targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The WHO adopted the German recipe to produce the tools for low-income countries that lacked the resources to make their own.
The German follow-up was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not available until 28 January, delaying the tests in the US. The US and China experienced some problems with the reliability of the test kits in the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the testing and requirements recommended by health experts.
Experts say that South Korea's widespread testing has helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built up over years by the South Korean government.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on 16 March advised that accelerating testing programs is the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19.The need for high-throughput testing due to the increasing spread of the virus left hundreds of thousands of tests pending in private laboratories in the US, and the availability of fluids, vaccines and chemicals was difficult.
In March 2020, China announced that it had problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
"In the US, the CDC developed test kits that had "flaws", and the government subsequently removed bureaucratic restrictions that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeci Biotechnology Co Ltd, but the results were found to be false".
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of errors in collecting samples or incorrect use of the tools.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with another test kit supplied by Shenzhen BioEC. The Czech Republic received 80% of the test kits from China that gave incorrect results. Slovakia received 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović recommended that they be dumped in the Danube. Turkey's Health Ministry's Atte Kara said that the Chinese-made test kits had a "high error rate" and "could not be brought into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but declared them unfit for use in early April 2020.
The testing and tracing and isolation process of people who have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their contacts produced positive results.
The researchers conducted two rounds of tests in the Italian city of Vosto, with a population of about 3,400, about ten days apart, the first COVID-19 death in Italy.
Half of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic and all the confirmed patients were quarantined.
This eliminated new infections altogether, as travel to the city hall was prohibited.
Despite the absence of severe restrictions such as mandatory closures of restaurants and retail establishments, the intensity of contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine have resulted in the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore spreading at a much slower rate than in other developed countries.
Many events have been cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began advising its residents to stay at home, but schools reopened in time after a holiday break on 23 March.
Many countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have followed a low-intensity lockdown, while actively managing the spread of infection through contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine.
In one statistical study, countries with the most testing had the lowest mortality rates compared to the number of deaths, because they were able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without adequate testing facilities and national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five confirmed samples and the first ten declared as COVID-19-free samples to one of the 16 WHO-designated laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of the 16 recommended laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"In the following graph, the column ""% as determined by tests"" is influenced by a country's policy on testing methods".
For all other countries, the number of confirmed cases is higher for the country that tests only those admitted to hospitals, compared to the country that tests all citizens, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of removing dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted material from one's hands.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain 'critical moments' of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which are spread through the feces and the mouth".
People can also get respiratory illnesses such as whooping cough or the common cold. If you don't wash your hands before touching something, such as your eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. the sinuses), you are likely to get this infection.
The five most important times of the day to wash with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the bottom of the baby or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and after preparing food, or when handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child after using the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical service can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to sanitize hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other germs that cause disease) and harmful or disease-causing chemicals.
It is most important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
and reducing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study suggests that improved handwashing routine among children under five years of age may help to increase height slightly.
In developing countries, the introduction of simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap can reduce the rates of childhood mortality associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce recurrent diarrhea by one third, comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap is associated with a 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), as well as the automatic behavior that occurs in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Cholera is a major cause of acute respiratory infections and the leading cause of death in children under five, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children annually.
According to UNICEF, making it a habit to wash your hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reduce deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other health promotion programmes as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing protects against the harmful effects of direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage as it dries the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a condition called acne, or inflammation of the skin, which is a corrosive, unbalanced skin condition that is especially common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times to wash hands with soap to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the bathroom (defecation, defecation), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing clothes), before feeding the child, before eating and/or after preparing food, and after handling raw meat, fish, or pet meat.
Other times when proper hand washing technique is required to prevent the spread of disease are before and after treating a cut or wound; after coughing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching rubbish.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. In 2014, Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the US was in the middle with 77%, and China was the lowest at 23%. There are now many behavioural change methods to adopt handwashing with soap at critical times.
The Philippine Education Department's Essential Health Program is an exemplary measure to promote the health and education of children.
Disinfection twice a year, in addition to hand washing with soap daily and flossing with fluoride daily are the focus of this national scheme.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The addition of soaps or detergents to water improves the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and washing powders is to reduce the barrier of solubility and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective skin cleanser, as the fats and proteins that are components of organic soil do not dissolve readily in water.
However, the purification is aided by an adequate water flow.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may retain bacteria derived from previous uses.
A small number of studies that have monitored the spread of infectious bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is not possible because the bacteria are carried by the foam.
The CDC still recommends "liquid soap with hands-free restrictions".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted among the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that antibiotic-resistant organisms are selective in nature due to the use of prescribed antibiotics or disinfectants.
However, antibacterial soaps contain typical antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of antibacterial agents for organisms.
Therefore, the antimicrobial strains in the antibacterial soap powder are not selected but may not be as effective as claimed when marketed.
In addition to the exogenous agents and skin protective agents, advanced formulations may include phenolic acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), microbial benzoic acid, and skin conditioners (carbohydrates, vitamins, green pepper, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicates that trichloroquine-containing food additives are as effective as antibacterial agents in preventing infection and removing bacteria from hands.
The hot water for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very fast at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oil that retains dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the number of microorganisms on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-based product that is not water-based.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based non-alcoholic hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol and are made either as a gel or as a moisturizer like glycerin for simple use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol, in combination with a thickener such as carbomor (polymer of acrylic acid).
Adding hydrogen peroxide to the water further increases the antimicrobial activity. Purifiers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol-containing purifiers kill bacteria, including the drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE) that cause tuberculosis and some pathogens (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, syphilis, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-alcohol rubbing sanitizers kill 99.97% of bacteria on the hands in 30 seconds of use (3.5 concentration reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 concentration reduction) of bacteria in 1 minute of use. Hand sanitizers are highly effective against bacteria and have low levels of activity against some pathogens.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are completely ineffective against norovirus (or NorVac) viruses, the common cause of gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptic or alcohol wipe should be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The front and back of both hands and the tips and fingers of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The CDC recommends hand sanitizer washing, especially if the hands are visibly dirty, to ensure that the fingers are thoroughly washed, and that the hands are rubbed with both palms.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their simplicity and rapid disinfectant action against microorganisms; however, they should not act as a substitute for proper hand washing if soap and water are not available.
If you do not add anti-irritants and/or skin moisturisers to the formula, dry skin is a common problem with frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
The alcohol drying effect can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other juvenile drugs to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness, compared to soaps or antimicrobial washing powder.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or increased skin resistance to alcohol or rare hand itching due to additives in alcohol.
The attraction is that it is less irritating and less irritating to touch than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous agents do not clean organic matter on the hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens can still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on its ingredients and composition, and historically has been largely limited to alcohol and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
Most recently, in contrast to alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy with repeated use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions, compounding regimens using benzaloconium chloride have been shown to have sustained and total antimicrobial activity after use.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap, and instead use ash or clay.
Ash or mud is more effective than using only water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than slowing it down.
Like soap, ash can act as a disinfectant because when it comes in contact with water, it produces an alkaline solution.
When soap was not available, the World Health Organization recommended ash or sand as a substitute for soap.
The handwashing protocol for preventing infection recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended, because standing mud may be contaminated, and the water temperature makes no difference.
Rub your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and the base of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better when using soap than when using water alone.
Press and rub for at least 20 seconds.
Squeezing and rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, while prolonged squeezing removes more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Hand washing in the dishwasher can contaminate the hands again.
Dry with a clean cloth or let air dry.
Wet and damp hands are easily susceptible to infection. The areas that are usually missed by improper cleaning are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the fingernails.
Finger nails and partial nail polishes can provide a place for microorganisms.
A moisturizing ointment is often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection spreading.
Various low-cost options can be arranged for hand washing where there is no tap water and/or soap. For example, pouring water from a suspended toilet or handrail through a suitable drain and/or using sand if developing countries. In situations with low water supply (such as schools or rural areas of developing countries) there are water-saving solutions, "sand-pipes" and other low-cost options.
"A drip-tap is a simple technique that uses a jug suspended vertically by a rope, and consists of a foot-operated lever and soap knot to pour a small amount of water over the hands".
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over how to dry hands in public restrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the Paperclip Industry and the European Tissue Symposium, which compared the level of hygiene provided by paperclip, hot-air hand dryers and modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a hot-air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increases by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Hand-drying with an electric air dryer increases the number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing the hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips was reduced by an average of 76% and on the palms by 77%. The scientists conducted several tests to determine whether each type of drying system resulted in cross-contamination of other users in the bathroom and the environment of the room.
The jet-air dryer blows air out at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), which is capable of ejecting microorganisms from hands and equipment and potentially contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment within 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads microbes up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show significant micro-organism spread. A study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt in 2005 evaluated different types of drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared against paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative in the absence of soap and water during the journey.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the benefits of handwashing in the prevention of disease in the hospital setting and made it mandatory in 1846.
Electronic devices are available to provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Medical hand washing is the use of soap and water or gel to scrub each part of the hands for at least 15 seconds.
The hands are rubbed together.
If there is debris under the fingernails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can be present in the water on hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean cloth.
After drying, use the paper towel to stop the water (and open the drain if necessary).
This avoids contaminating the hands from those surfaces again.
Handwashing in health-care settings aims to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing is unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
A study shows that regular hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood circulation infections related to urethral ducts by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a review paper demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in health care settings.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines issued by the organization have been posted on the website of the organization for public comment.
A corresponding study was conducted by Wittby et al.
Commercial organizations can also measure and evaluate hand hygiene if they need to clarify the compliance with the regulation.
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 'five moments' to wash your hands:"
After exposure to blood/ bodily fluids
before the work required for infection prevention, and
After patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antimicrobial" soaps) gives hand washing liquid the ability to kill germs.
Such disinfection may be desirable before surgery or in systems where antibiotic-resistant organisms are more common. A surgeon needs a water tube that can 'wash', without touching, one's hands. This is necessary for the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile pads to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush for wiping and another sterile tool for cleaning under fingernails.
I want all the jewelry removed.
The procedure involves washing hands and foreheads up to the elbow for a period of 2-6 minutes.
No need for long scrub times (10 minutes).
The water in the forearms should be prevented from flowing back to the hands during washing.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or to use hand sanitizer.
For control of staph infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit from hand sanitization was obtained from the first 20% of washing, and the least additional benefit was obtained when the hand sanitization frequency was increased beyond 35%.
Washing with plain soap compared to washing with antibacterial soap was more than three times higher than the rate of bacterial infection spread through food. Hand-sweeping with an alcohol-based solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to hand-sweeping with an antibacterial soap, compared to hand-sweeping with an alcohol-based solution by 30 seconds.
Soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand washes in reducing the H1N1 flu virus and Clostridium difficile germs from hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings include instructing staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand washing, and providing written and verbal reminders to staff.
Further research is needed to determine which of these interventions will be most effective in different health systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap has been recognized as a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving good health and good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces is challenging the achievement of universal hand washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps are scarce near private or public toilets, despite the inexpensive availability of handwashing facilities.
However, less hand washing may be due to habit than to lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap will influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioural change in people.
Monitoring and evaluation are essential to make this work.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while campaigns via social media were less effective. One example is UNICEF's "three-star approach", an active program to promote handwashing in schools, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap and other sanitation, among other health needs.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can move from one to three star status.
The creation of hand washing stations is part of the hand washing promotion campaign to reduce disease and infant mortality.
Another example of an awareness-raising campaign that attempts to achieve behavioural change is the Global Handwashing Day. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have suggested that the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with dallying has been avoided.
However, one study suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly less costly than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable situations such as mothers who gave birth in hospitals or wounded soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis of Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by a stench called miasma.
After the foodborne illness and sanitary infections of 1980, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) actively promoted hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters on 'correct hand-washing techniques' have been posted near hand-washing basins in public toilets, office buildings and airport restrooms in Germany".
"The phrase 'washing one's hands of something' means to declare one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or to share in the responsibility".
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands and hands of Jesus Christ on the cross, but it has become a phrase with much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth frantically begins to wash her hands while trying to clean up a fictional stain, representing guilt over the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others after remembering or thinking about immoral acts, and that they have a greater respect for hand-washing utensils.
And those who are allowed to wash their hands after such thinking are less likely to engage in other sanitizing activities, such as voluntary activities.
Religions recommend hand washing for both sanitary and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is part of ritual hand washing found in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith in Judaism, Hinduism, Dewila and Netil Yedi, La'wafo in Christianity, and Vodou in Islam. Religions recommend sanitary hand washing, especially after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam make it mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet.
Furthermore, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam have made it mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
COVID19 related workplace risk controls
The use of occupational safety and health measures for risk controls to prevent the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the workplace risk controls related to COVID-19.
The formal workplace risk limitations are based on the work site and work environment, sources of risk of infection, severity of the disease in the community and risk factors of individual workers who may be infected with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure hazard jobs have low levels of work-related interaction with the public and other co-workers. Basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to isolate at home if ill, following proper respiratory procedures, maintaining hygiene in the work environment, and continuing to disinfect.
Moderate to high risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are likely to be affected by the current community spread, such as unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients or international travelers.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail businesses.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk controls for this group include better ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze pads and wearable personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
Health and mortuary workers who encounter a known or suspected COVID-19 case are considered by OSHA to be at high risk of infection. Workers who collect or handle samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 case or in a situation where a case is likely to develop are at high risk of infection.
The optimal risk controls for the workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and appropriate personal protective equipment appropriate to the work situation.
There are many consequences of COVID-19 infection in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to health problems, the need to care for others, or the fear of infection.
The patterns of business may change due to changes in the demand for goods and the means of obtaining them (going to buy goods at times of low demand or getting them through supply or drive-through services).
Finally, the export of goods from geographical areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.An Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan may be used to guide safety measures.
The plans specify the risk levels associated with various workplaces and work assignments, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and individual risk factors for older workers or for workers with chronic conditions.
They outline the necessary controls to avoid risks and the contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or provincial recommendations.
The targets for responding to infection include reducing employee transmission, protecting those at high risk with poor health conditions, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse effects on other companies in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the reactions received.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in the security and health-related sectors in South Asia to group risk controls by performance.
Where COVID-19 risks are unavoidable, the most effective control methods are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally the use of personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include isolating workers from work-related hazards rather than relying solely on the behavior of the workers. This is a solution that can be implemented easily and at a very low cost.
Administrative controls are changes in the processes or policies that an employee or employer must follow.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and management-based controls, but these can help prevent some risk-taking situations.
PPE should be selected based on the potential hazard to personnel, be suitably fitted (e.g., respirators), similarly, be worn properly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have little professional interaction with the public and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces are frequent and regular hand washing, encouraging workers to stay indoors if sick, breathing protocols including covering mouth and nose during cough and sneeze, installation of tissue paper and trash cans, managing remote work or interrupted work hours if necessary, encouraging workers to use tools and equipment of others, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of persons who are likely to be infected in a workplace is an important step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, flu symptoms, or any other symptoms, after not taking medications that reduce fever or change other symptoms for at least 24 hours.
According to the South East Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), work requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of a person who is likely, unknown or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to the current community spread around the business area, such as COVID-19 patients or an individual who has recently made an international trip to an area with a high COVID-19 prevalence, is considered to be moderate risk of exposure.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public in places such as schools, high-density work environments and high-crowd retail establishments. Engineering restrictions for teams working in such high-risk environments may include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation ratio, installation of physical barriers such as non-colored woven fabric barrier and installation of a customer service window-service. This may include the establishment of a safety and security code and the provision of a safety handbook, training and other information to workers on how to avoid the risks of exposure to COVID-19, including the need to provide information to employees on how to avoid illness, encourage workers to walk alone at home, provide a face-to-face meeting or a public information exchange program to encourage workers to engage in positive communication, establish a workplace safety code, such as a high-efficiency air filter, increase airflow ratio, install physical barriers such as non-colored woven fabric barrier barriers, and provide customer service window-service.
Workers in this risk group rarely require a respirator.
If a person becomes ill on the flight, formal restrictions to protect the workers and other passengers, including separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, assigning a crew member to serve the sick person, and providing a mask to the sick person or telling the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissues while coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear single use medical gloves when observing a sick passenger or touching body fluids or surfaces that may contain infection. Additional personal protective equipment should also be worn if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty in breathing.
The gloves and other disposable items should be stored in a biohazard bag and disposed of, and then contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. The precautions to be taken on commercial ships, including luxury ships and other passenger ships, if fever or other symptoms appear while on board, include postponing the voyage and self-isolation in case of illness and prompt notification to the on-board medical centre.
Generally, a person who is isolated in a room should have a medical examination there. For schools and child care facilities, regardless of the status of social contagion, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that if the infected person was in the school building, the area be closed for a short period of time to clean or disinfect the area.
In the case of moderate or low social contagion, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as field trips, cancellation of meetings and large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or catering in the restaurant, increasing the distance between tables, interrupted visit and dismissal times, limiting unwanted visitors and using separate sanitary office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
Extended school closures may be considered a strategy when there is significant community-level spread, in addition to social distancing strategies.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the level of immediate health risk to law enforcement personnel who are performing routine daily activities to be low.
Law enforcement officers who come in contact with persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are also recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during handling, household sanitary spray or wipe should be used to clean and disinfect work formwork and clothing before use and follow the general procedures for the disposal and disposal of used Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), the disposal of clothes and the washing.
Some health and sanitation workers are classified as high or very high risk by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
Healthcare, support, laboratory service providers and medical transport workers who are working in high risk areas for known or suspected COVID-19 infection.
A high incidence condition is considered to be a condition where the worker is likely to develop a communicable disease or is involved in the collection or handling of samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Possible conditions for the development of a sputum include intubation, coughing procedures, lung fluid testing, some dental procedures and examinations or sample collection by puncture.
High exposure risk in mortuary work, including workers involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these can become very high exposure risk if autopsy is performed. Additional engineering restrictions for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients when aerosol-producing procedures are performed.
Providing special negative pressure ventilation in some sanitary and mortuary settings may be desirable.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newly arrived patients be kept in isolation in waiting areas depending on suspected COVID-19 infection. OSHA recommends that people who are known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be kept within 6 feet of a person who is in contact with them and wear a respirator in addition to PPE in situations where a person is likely to develop a fever.
In the United States, NOIH-approved N95 filtration respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes qualification-testing, training, and clinical exams.
Other types of respirators may be more protective and comfortable for workers to wear. WHO does not recommend full suits as COVID-19 is not transmitted through respiratory infection but through bodily fluids.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that only personnel working at the entry point of entry or exit from the country should be provided with face masks to wear during surgical procedures.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, safety glasses or face shield, gown and gloves for those who collect, care for or transport respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosol generating procedures.
In cases of possible complication, N95 or FFP2 respirator is used instead of surgical mask.
As the global supply of personal protective equipment is inadequate, the WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment by means of telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those engaged in direct care to enter the room with the COVID-19 patient, using only personal protective equipment necessary for the specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring the personal protective equipment supply chain and signaling and encouraging people without symptoms not to use face coverings.
The project is funded by the European Union and the European Commission.

Subject: [COVID-19] Reducing the workload and preparing for the future
The date/time of the submission: 14th March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a very special situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the global interconnectedness of humanity and the responsibilities we have to shoulder towards each other.
We have no precedent for these challenges, but we know that the best response is to put global empathy, cooperation and community building at the heart of this institution.
The friendliness and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and chats is a remarkable testimony to the great humanity with whom we have been fortunate to work.
There is nothing more proud and grateful for me than to count you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation of our work.
He reminded me of how important it is that the world is now looking to Wikipedia for information, and that maintaining these important resources online for all is a powerful signal.
Whether it's maintaining our sites, or giving money to our colleagues, or helping our communities stay safe, it's your work that makes it possible.
The information that Wikipedia provides is more relevant to the world than ever before.
It is a moment where we not only act, but how we do it in a way that has a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this work and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work together from this week onwards.
Changes in our mission and operational plans
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our approach and plans for the coming days and months.
We discussed what we considered to be the appropriate response to the situation we were facing and the best way to sustain the institution at this time.
We wanted to relieve the stress and support our work in the long run.
If you want to reduce the intensity, do that.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Four hours a day or 20 hours a week is our daily work expectation.
We do not give leave - if you want to work more than your normal hours, this job will take full advantage of you.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and you may want to support your loved ones, you may want to go grocery shopping, or you may want to go to the doctor, but your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your time.
If you are sick, do not go to work.
We shouldn't say it, but we say it.
No medical leave or PTO required - Help your team to edit calendars and action plans and send information to your manager to ensure that the main parts of the work are focused.
(If you are confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform the officer at T&C Ops, T&C can provide you with the support you need and ensure that your condition is receiving the proper attention of the management.)
The full amount will be paid to those who work on the hourly basis.
As we have said before, we are committed to delivering on our promise to our contractors and our employees to pay them according to their working hours.
All employees will be paid on the basis of normal working hours.
This includes the inability to work because you are ill.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve the stress of the world around us.
The work we do, especially at times like these, can yield unexpected results.
Again, it's all about your self-preservation.
Our request is that you contact your manager so that we know what to expect and then we can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we have to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising groups (among others) do the critical work that requires additional support.
We will initiate a process with all sectors to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting those that are essential to our work.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we all need to focus on the most essential projects now.
Delaying the present will reduce the impact later.
"We do not plan to work as a 'double-time catch-up' once the pandemic is over".
There is no expectation of working overtime to meet the unrealistic deadline.
We accept that the context has changed and we will work to set new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What is APP?
We intend to adjust the timetable for the implementation of our Annual Plan 2020-2021 to reflect the new practice and daily working expectations.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 program, which gives employees more time over the next few weeks to prioritize important work, self-care and caring for loved ones, while allowing room for those who need or want a reduced schedule.
This extension of the deadline greatly reduces the current planning workload and stress across the organization.
We will present our plan to the Executive Committee next week, and will update delegates and teams on next steps once confirmation is received.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office condition, chance of infection and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco had tested positive for COVID-19.
However, as a precautionary measure, we cleaned all surfaces in the San Francisco office with an antimicrobial cleaning team to disinfect.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant-protein mixture to disinfect surfaces, the front room and the capacitors that accessed our site.
The building maintains a code of ethics or legal obligation to use products that ensure the safety of the residents.
We are relieved to know that the office will be ready for us when we decide to return to work.
Our DC office is located in a web site, and they have shared their COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC staff.
As of this week, our DC office has been fully tele-moderated in accordance with the guidance shared with San Francisco last week.
As some of our New York City colleagues know, we are also discussing the lease of a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know this is a fix, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to one or two hour increments at most.
If long-term sessions are required, explore how they can be broken down into sessions of several days.
Define clearly the need for the meeting, create a plan of action, and send the material for study in advance.
Set the live feed to default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live linking and connectivity.
One to arrange formal meetings in advance, one to monitor questions that arise during the chat and to keep track of the list of speakers and one to help take notes (or joint note-taking).
If you need a handy headset, email tech support.

The HR functional group is taking action to implement a webinar based on the work environment guidance to support the increased level of shared work across the organization.
We have asked all social grant recipients to cancel public events sponsored by Wikimedia, such as the edithons last week, until the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the pandemic over.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions meant that they could not complete the agreed-upon grant measures and that no one would be penalised for delays or deviations in reaching those targets.
This week we will follow up further guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
For the global community, instead of focusing on helping clarity and capacity in their own communities, Wikimedia and others, they are learning that this disruption has created misery in general.
CRT is in the process of setting up a page on the meta-wiki for the community to help us keep track of impact and follow our communications, taking into account the future.
Keeping up with COVID-19 related issues
We will send invitations to your calendars to attend a special staff meeting next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT.
We can use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time with each other.
We are ready to help you in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can get some information from this email and all essential COVID-19 related information can be found in the Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages periodically and process all the information in one place.
We are also maintaining regular contacts with staff in countries with significant impact.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a key function or insurance challenge or assistance required, please do not hesitate to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to provide the necessary support and cooperation.
If you have any confidential or sensitive information, please email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a way of abandoning our mission and duty.
Rather, they are recognition that at this time, we may have to adapt our work and our commitments in a way that we have never done before.
We consider these steps necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support to our movement, and provide the service the world expects of them.
The tasks we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and for the important work that is coming in the next few weeks or possibly months.
We need all of you to do that, so we want you to participate as much as you can when the need arises, and we want you to take care of yourself and your family in the right way.
Now, please -- wash your hands, and don't touch your face!
The other three are Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grand I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jeneeneine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2-ACE2) is an enzyme that is bound to the outer surface (in the cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE-2 counteracts the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing ang (1-7). This makes it a promising target drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE-2 acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing enzyme located in the inner membrane and on the surface of other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 site and a C-terminal renal amino acid transporter site for the collector.
ACE2 is a single-pass first-class membrane protein, whose enzyme-dependent domain is expressed on the surface of cells in the lung and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the membrane by another enzyme called sheathase, resulting in a soluble protein that is incorporated into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is present in most organs: Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of secondary lung alveolar cells, endothelial cells of the small intestine, endothelial cells of the artery and spleen, and the smooth muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
The ACE2 messenger mRNA is expressed in the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord, the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an anti-equilibrium to ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstriction hormone angiotensin II, which is the main source of the hormone.
ACE2 is formed by the cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis of it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE-2 can also cause cleavage between [des-ARG9]-prodigaine, epleen, neurodegeneration, dinorphin A and ghrelin, among many other peptides.
ACE2 also regulates SLC6.A19, a neutral amino acid transporter that ensures the delivery of proteins and large molecules to cells. This has been confirmed in Hartnap disease, a rare form of amino acid metabolism.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 (ACE2) acts as the main entry point for some coronaviruses to cells, including human coronavirus N.L63 (HCoV-NL63), SARS-CoV-SARS (the pathogen that causes SARS-CoV-SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface is responsible for endocytosis and transfer of both the pathogen and the enzyme into the endosomes where they are located within the cells.
This entry procedure requires the replacement of the S protein by the protein degradation serine of the serum, TMPRSS2. The suppression of this is currently being studied to see if it can be therapeutic. This has led to the hypothesis that lowering the level of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with standard ACE suppression and ARP therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that 'the use of A.C.E. tablets was associated with a significantly lower risk of pneumonia than controls, by 34%.'"
"Furthermore, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been shown to reduce the risk of pneumonia among patients at high risk of developing pneumonia, especially those at risk of stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors reduces pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Resonance human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for acute pulmonary injury and appeared to improve pulmonary circulation and biohydration in piglets with acute respiratory syndrome induced by fatty liver.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, and 30 minutes of onset of action, with an additional 24 hours (duration) of benefit.
Several findings suggest that RHACE2 may be a promising drug in patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with circulating angiotensin II elevations. Injected RHACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory tract syndrome.
"COVID-19 apps are mobile-speaking software applications designed to help identify contacts during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected individual".
In some territories and jurisdictions, a number of apps have been developed or proposed with official government support.
Several infrastructures for building contact tracing apps have been improved.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly with regard to systems based on tracking the geolocation of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly on their Android and iOS platforms.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alibaba, has developed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with COVID-19 patients.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, the app is called TraceToGuider.
"The app was developed by the local IT community, will be released for free and will be handed over to the government. West Macedonia launched the Bluetooth-based app 'Stop Corona!' which detects the exposure of infected people and provides rapid information to health authorities".
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
'On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development and would be released within weeks, and that similar apps ('Stopcovid') were planned in Ireland and France.'
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Treadguather app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia is also looking to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to keep those infected from leaving home.
Ross Anderson, professor of defense engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and that the app's performance would be less effective if its take-up was limited to only a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of malicious or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on which types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, allowing only "official" or reputable companies.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Human rights campaigners expressed concern about the implications of using the coronavirus app to engage in mass surveillance, and in particular whether the surveillance infrastructure, created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, would be removed once the threat of disease was contained.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The companies announced eight conditions in government plans:
Surveillance must be legal, necessary and proportionate;
The observatory and the extension of the observatory shall have a sunset rule;
The use of data should be for COVID-19 purposes only;
Data privacy and anonymity should be protected and protected on the basis of provenance;
The rise of discrimination and marginalization must be avoided through digital surveillance;
Sharing data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Citizens should have the right to defend themselves against flood damage and to resist flood damage;
"Meaningful participation of all 'relevant stakeholders' will be required, including public health professionals and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple project seeks to solve the problem of persistent monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems if the tracking mechanism is no longer required.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, removing both the need to download apps and the ability to bypass tracking.
In Israel, network-based surveillance was authorized.
Network-based solutions that access location source data have significant potential for privacy concerns.
However, not all organizations with central servers need access to personal location information; many privacy-protecting systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to identify people who may have come into contact with the infected person.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and then aggregates this information and sends it to the people who may be affected by SMS.
The information is used to alert potential contacts, and the government has made the location information publicly available, thanks to sweeping changes in information privacy laws in the country since the MERS outbreak began.
This information is publicly available via a number of apps and websites. Countries including Germany are considered to use both as centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details are yet to be released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is a well-established concept that has been in the research literature since around 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions such as sending user proximity tracing to other mobile phones using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is an integrated effort that has centralized and decentralized approaches, not a protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preserving proximity potential contact detection (DP-PBD/DP-3D), temporary contact numbers (DCN, FKA contact event numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and mobile contact detection protocols (PCT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The Privacy Team at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or pathway penetration information to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
"This is based on research published in the white paper "Research by Ops Con Roach in March 2020: Maintaining Personal Privacy in a Pandemic". Another similar initiative is the SafeTrace platform from Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies, originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that information.
On April 5, 2020, the Global DCN-Collegiate was established by a group of consortia with a common approach and often overlapping protocols, aiming to gradually reduce the number of applications that are detected and alerted, and to enable a global platform to achieve widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government made its official governmental application, the BloodyRays protocol, public.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an effort to identify the person in the contact, using a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption, which the companies said would be done in a privacy-preserving way.
They also presented the specifications of key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be released in three phases:
Official secrets - Tools have been developed to help governments develop a protocol to detect possible contacts to protect against the coronavirus
The company plans to integrate this functionality directly with iOS, Android, Google, and Apple, by first distributing the system through OS updates and solving the continuous monitoring issues, and then removing it in the same way if the threat passes.
B' drug re-purposing (also known as drug reuse, re-specification, re-purposing or therapy change) is the re-purposing of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
It is a part of scientific research and is currently being used to continuously develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research methods include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the exchange of fluids to help prevent the disease. SARS-CoV-2 consists of approximately 66 drug proteins, each with multiple fibroblasts.
Studying those binding sites provides a plausible blueprint for developing effective antibodies against the COVID-19 protein.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include pappan-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicase, S protein and ATP ribosphate.
Hussain A.A., et al. studied several compounds, then optimized their basic similarity with the highest approval with approved drugs. This is done to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study for prescription in a clinical study format.
Chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the unified clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Organization (EUA).
The treatment is not approved by the FDA's clinical evaluation process, and is only approved under the European Union (EUA) as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical evaluation.
The CDC said that the "use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of immunodeficiency or SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
"There is no other way", the doctors said, "but they are using this medicine".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine contraceptive use.
'Chinese medical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir had a 'clear benefit.'
In Shenzhen, 35 patients were confirmed as free of infection in an average of 4 days, while 45 patients had an infection duration of 11 days.
In the Wuhan study, half of 240 patients with pneumonia were given favipiravir and half received imifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminded the public that the current evidence to support the drug is minimal and primitive.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its own availability and supply it to university hospitals using the military, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has informed the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Halethra) concluded that the combination of the antibody lopinavir and ritonavir ""did not produce any benefit""".
These drugs are designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to protease.
A team of University of Colorado researchers is attempting to modify drugs to detect a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.[citation needed] There is criticism within the scientific community over the operation of reusable sources of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ridonavir in the International Standardised Test.
Remdesivir was developed and improved by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had targeted anti-pathogenic activity against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
The difficulty in immunotherapy is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Early preclinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a higher genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two clinical trials run by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and the other for people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of vitamin C administered intravenously to people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 are being conducted; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began trials of the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial for the inhaled corticosteroid Degenin Alvesco (Siglesonide) for asthma, which could be suitable for the treatment of pre-diagnosed patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A second phase trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in 200 patients selected from patients hospitalized with severe impairment in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying colchicine's role in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older diagnosed with COVID-19 and experiencing mild symptoms without admission to hospital.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who have no effective contraception are not eligible.
In Italy, several anticoagulant medications are being tested.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, and the Italian Medicines Agency has issued guidelines on its use.
A clinical trial in Italy on 300 patients was reported on April 14 to have examined the use of enoxaparin sodium in the doses required for immunization and treatment.
Since SARS-CoV2 is a pathogen, much scientific focus has been on the re-development of approved anti-viral drugs developed for previously unexpected diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ripavirine: Ripavirine was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to China's 7th review
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th review of China
Some of the antibiotics identified as reusable for treatment of COVID-19 are:
Doxilumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Trials in Italy and China. See also #COVID-19 for dosilisumab.
The Beta A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several attempts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a vaccine against the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was not expected to be available for 18 months.
In the first phase of safety trials in April, there were five candidate vaccines.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A worldwide outbreak of measles occurred in 2020 which led to significant investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Several companies are using already released genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In April, CEPI noted that speed, productivity, large-scale deployment and global access are imperatives in vaccine discovery initiatives.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology research platforms and their progress in developing a successful vaccine against COVID-19 by early 2020.
The main objectives of the Phase I safety studies are as follows:
The first phase of development and vaccine development: Moderna and the first phase of development of the mRNA-1273
The microbial carrier (phase I developer and vaccinator: Cancino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 carrier) is a small, common, and highly resistant strain of the bacterium that is the most commonly used carrier of the virus.
As announced by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 active projects have been confirmed (according to Milken), and 37 have made announcements, but little public information is available (planned or thought to be in development).
Phase I-II trials are generally randomized, non-prescription drug-controlled and multi-site primary safety and immunity testing to determine the most accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing disease, while also monitoring adverse effects caused by the optimal dose of the drug.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been included in a human evaluation study (still in ""preclinical"" research)".
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which would genetically modify pathogenic proteins to induce an immune response.

In France, the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Consortium (CEPI), an alliance for pandemic product innovations that includes Pasteur University, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, announced on 19 March 2020 an investment of $4.9 million. The total investment of CEPI in the development of COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
Moderna, Cureweigh, Inovaio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, University of Queensland are the other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccines were developed within 14 days of receiving the approval from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on clinical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine innovation efforts at Canadian institutions and universities, including Medico and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At about the same time, the Canadian government announced 192 million Canadian dollars for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which it plans to establish as a national ""vaccine bank"" containing many new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine called BitGovak in mice, stating that "the MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 sub-vaccine exhibits potent anti-specific immunization reactions [in mice] that are clearly visible starting 2 weeks after immunization".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy announced that it is developing a DNA-based vaccine as a nasal spray.
Using microRNAs, this DNA is engineered to create pathogen-like particles that are harmless to human bacteria, which can trigger the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise joined with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google on cloud computing, where the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have different effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means they can get benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Further random testing in Australia is looking to recruit 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
The early-stage research to evaluate vaccine efficacy using coronavirus COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-mutant mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for biosafety level 3 control measures and international coordination to handle live pathogens to ensure standardised safety practices.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
While MERS was widely practiced, it is hoped that existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more trials are underway, all of which are anti-pathogenic, two anti-adenobacterial (ChAdOx1-MERS, PVRS-GamVac), and one anti-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promote conspiracy theories that the pathogen behind COVID-19 has been identified and that a vaccine for it already exists.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to patents for gene sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Corona disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from the onset of the infection to the first symptom is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most infections result in mild symptoms, some are progressive to pneumonia and dental dysfunction caused by the pathogen.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 5,68,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread through close contact between humans, usually through small droplets emitted during coughing, sneezing, or talking.
These diarrhoeae are formed by exhalation, and they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than being transmitted over long distances.
Human infection can also be caused by touching the eyes, nose or mouth after touching the infected surface.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission is possible both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is a nasopharyngeal fluid-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
The use of face masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their carers.
Recommendations for the use of face masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in the WHO's six regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or may have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty getting up, and a blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be present.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China were initially confined to chest stiffness and imaging.
In some patients, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period (the time interval between symptoms).
The incubation period of COVID-19 (the time interval between onset of symptoms) is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all infected people show symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is not yet fully understood; early evidence suggests that they may also contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who are infected but do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is under study, the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of confirmed patients were asymptomatic at the time of admission.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily infection count on 1 April; of the 166 infections that occurred that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both tobacco and salt water carry high levels of viruses.
Talking out loud can cause more bankruptcy than just talking out loud.
Studies have shown that when the mouth is open, the air droplets can travel from a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted by learning, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bio-aerous transmission may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the hall outside the public rooms provided positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as catheterization and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may be sprayed on the trachea, resulting in the release of toxins into the air.
Despite concerns that it could spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; transmission is possible before symptoms appear, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), while not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, says that one person can typically infect two to three others, with the virus surviving on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, pathogenicity was found in cardboard for one day, in copper (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and in 99% copper for up to four hours.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Even soap and washing powder can be effective if used correctly; soap products break down the pathogen's fatty protective layer, rendering it inactive, as well as releasing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antiseptic), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saline samples were taken on average two days after admission to hospital.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed more viruses, and the sixth patient showed more viruses on the second day of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe respiratory coronavirus, first isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan.
All features of naturally occurring coronaviruses are also present in the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which causes its defense bubble to burst. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The organs most affected by COVID-19 are the lungs, as the virus accesses the host cells via an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in the type II alloviolar cells of the lungs.
The pathogen uses a separate exogenous glycoprotein called a peplomer to interact with ACE2 and enter another cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of hospitalized patients were diagnosed with acute cardiac failure, and it is more common in severe cases.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to organ-based anti-inflammatory activity and immune system disorders during disease progression, but severe cardiac damage may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The incidence of venous thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombolism (25%) has been found to be higher in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection, and may be associated with poor prognosis.The autopsy of those who died from COVID-19 found smallpox lesions that spread into their lungs (difusivolar demyelinating-ADD), and lymphocytic lesions with fluidic cellular inflammation.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has an induction affinity for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients have organ-specific hyperinflammatory symptoms that are associated with the development of the disease.
In particular, GM-CSF, a T-cell-secreting pathogen, has been shown to be associated with IL-6 inflammation and severe pulmonary disease in single-cell-secreting COVID-19 patients.
Autopsy reports of infiltration of lymphocytes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR).
Usually the test is performed on breath samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or cochlear sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a couple of days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated and sequenced a strain of the coronavirus, so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect existing infections and determine if a person has had infections in the past) were in progress but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experimental experience shows that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test for use later that month on 21 March 2020. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommended methods for the detection of infectious diseases based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bifacial multi-mode ground-mirror opacity with external, asymmetric and posterior distribution is common in early infection.
There may be a predominance of pleural fluid, a contraction of the respiratory tract (thickening of the ventral wall with varying cavity fillings), and a strengthening of the disease progression.
There is some information available on micro ulcers and the pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy:
Physical examination: pulmonary edema, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary stiffness and pneumonia
There are four levels of severity of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary inflammation, pneumocyst hyperplasia, large differential lymphocytes, secondary inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of many nucleated giant cells
Acute pneumonia: Transmitted alveolar leakage with transmissible alveolar damage (TAD)
DAD is responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute blood colitis.
Curing pneumonia: the structure of leaks in alveolar cavities and pulmonary transverse fibrosis
Blood: diffuse vascular coagulation (DIC); white blood cell increase reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, observing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
To control transmission by asymptomatic individuals, the CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines include that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19. As a vaccine cannot be expected as early as possible but not until 2021, the key element in managing COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the infection, called 'tapping the curve',
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, sneezing or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is generated from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not an active agent for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, resuscitation, and support for other vital organs that have been affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxidase (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory dysfunction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to enhance immunity.
Supplementary therapies may be effective for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care unit specialists and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions in a free resource called the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a substitute for ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions are mandatory to reduce the spread of the pathogen, especially during procedures where health systems can release droplets, such as intubation or the use of a hand-operated respirator.
CDC recommends that healthcare professionals caring for COVID-19 patients be kept in an airborne infection isolation room (AIRR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions.CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment: PPE, respirator or mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of a mask) are recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings, but masks are approved by the FDA for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against the specified biological agent is not guaranteed as unauthorized use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using masks or, lastly, home-made masks.
Most COVID-19 patients are not in a critical condition requiring ventilation or alternatives, but a certain percentage are.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory disorders is being actively studied with some evidence that inpatients with high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure may be avoided.
It is not known whether these two treatments provide the same benefits in patients who are critically ill.
Some doctors prefer perforated machine ventilation (invasive mechanical ventilation) when available, as this technique limits the spread of particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula (hyflow nasal cannula). Acute infection is most common in older people (over 60 years of age, and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds for individuals, which limits the capacity of health systems to handle the sudden surge in COVID-19 patients requiring admission.
A study in China found that 5% of patients were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized end up in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxidation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure control methods and high PEEP capacity respirators are required to reduce the risk of ventilation-related pulmonary injury and pneumothorax and increase the supply of oxygen.
The old ventilators can go without high PEEP.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antibiotics are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be very promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antibiotics may be tried in severe cases.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) participate in efficacy and safety trials of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval for the treatment of sick urine as an investigational treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical studies needed to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contact" with surveillance data and thus detect the possibility of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-isolation if a potential risk is detected, but also alerts local health authorities.Handphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile location detection and artificial intelligence can help identify people who are infected and know who they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government helped security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of people who were reported to have the coronavirus.
This action was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may have come in contact with affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared integrated phone location data with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Corporation to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
Giulio Calella, the Italian regional health commissioner, said he was told by mobile phone service providers that '40% of the population is constantly on the move.'
The German government hosted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kajilai has called for a global response to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may suffer from isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
BBC's Rory O'Connor points out that 'increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline are the perfect storm to take a toll on people's mental and physical health.'
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, which is similar to other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
Moderate infections usually heal within two weeks, while those with already severe or complicated illnesses may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is low.In some individuals, COVID-19 can infect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In those with severe infection, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, neurological shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include blood poisoning, abnormal clotting and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Abnormal clotting, especially increased prothrombin time, has been described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function has been seen in 4% of these patients.
About 20-30% of people who come in with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) have an average of seven days between admission to hospital and death.
In the study of disease incidence, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, and from six to 41 days for the initial full-blown case.
The study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found a male mortality rate of 2.8% and a female mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathologic examinations of lung samples at autopsy show that there is a polyphasic damage that can be spread with cellular fibromyalgia leakage in both lungs.
The cell-damaging changes induced by the pathogen were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image was consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
China's National Health Commission reported an 11.8% increase in troponin levels and cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, in the deaths.
According to the March data of the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospital had pre-existing medical conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomy of a region can also affect mortality.
Not only because of those regional differences, but because of systemic complications, mortality estimates from this condition vary.
The death rate is exaggerated by not taking into account the number of mild cases.
However, the fact that there are deaths as a result of past infections may indicate that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Commission found that some survivors had a decrease in lung capacity of 20% to 30%, and recommended lung ultrasound for organ damage.
This can lead to post-invasive diagnosis following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown whether it provides effective and long-lasting immunity to people recovering from past infections.
Immunity appears to be possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of infection recovered from COVID-19 have been reported to have subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus.
These patients are believed to be in a worse state of chronic infection rather than a recurrent one.
The pathogen is natural and is thought to have originated from animals through direct infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection is almost entirely human-to-human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The official publications of the World Health Organization (WHO) noted the initial symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several methods are commonly used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and age, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment choices, time since initial infection and age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to laboratory-confirmed deaths of COVID-19 without clinical or epidemiological diagnosis.The ratio between mortality and morbidity reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time interval.
The global case-to-case ratio was 6.9% (1,53,822/2,24,0191) as of 17 April 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the CFR (Case Fatality Rate), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the IFR, which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (detected and undetected) who die from the disease.
These statistics are non-time bound and follow a specific population group that has been infected by immunization.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the heart of the outbreak in Italy, the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, 4,60,080 (1.7%) people have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through carnival festivals and spread to younger people, causing relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths were classified properly.
Also, the German health system is not very good.
In the Netherlands, it is estimated that 3% of donors may have antibodies.
69 (0.004% of the population) deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate differed for men and women.
The study found that men were more likely to die in China and Italy.
For men, the risk is highest when they are in their 50s, and the gap for men and women is only close to 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immune differences, lower smoking among women, and the development of conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than in men, may account for the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected and 72% of those who died with COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are men and women, and they are more likely to be infected.
The official name of the disease was "COVID-19" announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus, T stands for disease, and 19 stands for 31 December 2019, when the outbreak was first identified.
The name is named in accordance with the International Recommendation for the Prevention of Name-making with the Intent to Defamate, to avoid referring to a specific geographical area (e.g. China), animal species or group of people. The most severe respiratory pathogen causing COVID-19 is named as coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2)).
"WHO additionally uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communications".
Both the disease and the pathogen are commonly referred to as the 'coronavirus'.
Both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as 'coronavirus' and 'Wuhan coronavirus' during the early outbreak in Wuhan, China.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the names 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Disease as the interim names for the pathogen and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidance against the use of place names for diseases and pathogens.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in common supply chains, some oil producers are printing hygiene products such as nasal wipes and respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve and the supplier was unable to deliver in the required time, a local startup company retrospectively-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.
It appears that humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of replication of the pathogen in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a 'solidarity trial' to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antimicrobial compounds that work well in terms of efficacy".
There are no vaccines at present, but various companies are actively working on developing a vaccine.
Previous work by SARS-CoV is used, because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccine strategies are being explored.
First, researchers aim to develop a complete anti-viral vaccine.
The use of such a pathogen, whether it is inactive or dead, is aimed at exposing the immune system of the human body against a new outbreak of COVID-19.
The second strategy, sub-stage vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-types of the virus.
For SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a modern technology for vaccine manufacturing).
The strategies are derived from the need to test experimental vaccines for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began in Seattle with four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that has been cloned from the pathogen that causes the disease.Immunogen-based development has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), but this is debatable.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials are evaluating an already approved treatment for malaria, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Chinese trials are mostly targeted at the antimicrobial drugs, with results from nine phase III trials on remdesivir expected by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for a COVID-19 vaccine and drug contributors was underway as of April 2020. Existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, which include remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxyglucoquine, lopinavir/ridonavir and lopinavir/interferon beta-coated ritonavir.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence for the efficacy of Remdesivir.
Patients who have received yet to be approved remdesivir therapy have shown clinical improvement.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for a co-worker reassessment of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Gerontology notes that while it recommends a daily dose of one gram, that dose is twice as dangerous and nonlethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.China's 7th edition guidelines include interferon, ripavirine or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Further nitasoxanide has been recommended in the Vivo study after demonstrating a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have demonstrated that early thrombophilytic priming by transmembrane protein serine 2 (TMPRS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without acitromycin are highly limiting and prevent the medical world from accepting them without further study.Ocelamyvir does not objectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms may be a problem in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine-resistant toxic properties. Docilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines of the National Health Administration of China based on the conclusion of a small study.
It is currently undergoing Phase 2 randomized trials in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokine storms, it is thought to be responsible for some of the deaths of those affected.
In 2017, the FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor based on retrospective studies of treatment for steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, otherwise known as CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of purified and enriched antibodies produced by the immune systems of COVID-19 survivors to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine for alternative immunization.
This strategy was tried out against Tsar with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism of action by which inactive antiprotein therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antiprotein-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis are possible.
Other forms of passive antithetical therapy, for example, the use of manufactured antibodies, are in progress.
The fluid fraction of blood taken from recovered patients and the production of an enzyme-specific antibody for this pathogen can be increased for rapid use.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
