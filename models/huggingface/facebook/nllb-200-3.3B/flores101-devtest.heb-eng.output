Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already been proven, but it also provides details that fossil lenses can usually provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was a brownish-orange at the top with a pale cartenoid tint at the bottom.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a developed tail, called a quill, but have other features of feathers - plumage and feathers - researchers concluded that quills were probably a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display. The researchers suggest that although it is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult animal rather than a chick's plumage.
The researchers suggested that although it's a juvenile dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than chicken plumage.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

The amount of light and rotation together determine a star's ROS number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rosby number, the less active the planet is with respect to magnetic reversals.

Most of the work was theoretical, but the software was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on the Earth and causes tides and ripples, the Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter in the galaxy's environment is found around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and it's made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been an experience of simple technology: Voters are isolated in a booth and put into a pre-printed paper envelope indicating the candidate they are voting for.
After the officials verify his identity, the voter sends the envelope to the ballot box and stamps it on the voters' book.

Candidates can send representatives to serve as witnesses at every stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, according to specific procedures.

Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adakoya has since appeared in court in Edinburgh charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting conviction and trial, but any evidence could be flawed as her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and courts have seen the publication of images as potentially biased.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are indeed willing to take risks if they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Justice Department, which handles all prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made until at least a conviction.
The document, according to the leak, will address the border conflict, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, the sanctity of both peoples, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement while the Palestinian Authority agrees to keep such a presence for only five years.
It was determined that the shootings in the additional pest control experiment should be under close supervision of the peasants, as the experiment is supervised and its effectiveness is under review.
"In partnership with the Parks and Wildlife Service and the Sporting Robbery Association of Australia (New South Wales) Ltd., authorized volunteers have been recruited as part of the Sporting Robbery Association's hunting program".
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the NPWS Heritage Conservation Park, the four shooters selected for the first shooting attempt received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelli yesterday appointed a new nine-member provisional electoral committee.
This is the fifth CEP for Martelli in four years.
Last month a presidential committee recommended the dismissal of the previous provisional electoral council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The protests, which were sometimes violent, were sparked by the lack of elections, which were supposed to have been held as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods that overheated were reported, a problem that led to six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of global warming, which the company called ""not serious"."
"The firm responded by calling Apple's rejection of the report "very regretful".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands reports no damage has been reported in the state.
Even the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle into the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took the place of an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate the subject of premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that taking a hormone would accelerate the development of the fetal lungs of the baby.
The Shinewa News Agency reports that government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also shared his honor.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Lona was the first queen of the Hackers, my first director. Luna died on the night of the two moons.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Lona was as freakish as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I miss her... let's hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who responded to the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The caring Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view, and are interested in Queen Elizabeth II being the last Queen of Australia.
In the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple sculls at the British Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was called into question by his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome his pain because it's forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various materials and software in early February and the announcement went out on Tuesday.
It could be that comets were a source of water that reached Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political chatter and nonsense".
He's been speculated to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon emissions.
"It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based technology to allow flight controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information".
For passengers, transportation and trains will not stop in Bumblebee, and parking and ride-hailing facilities are not available in the area.
Concerns about the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was previously thought that the process took much longer, due to the inclusion of an endemic Darwin's peach (Geospiza fortes), and a large migratory cactus peach (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be stretched to a thin thread, which can be twisted and folded. It can be ground or flattened to form a pattern.
"It can be made very thin and pasted on another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical.
The solution changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level was determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with wet, clean hands, form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make it feel weird and form a kind of shell.
In the towns of Arapa and Muangodaru, there was a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, bathhouses were sometimes part of public baths where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then transmits it back down, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
You need a giant rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel has done for us is give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including pet free-ranging cats) that eat the much larger small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche, a special role each cat fulfils that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, they live in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males, along with no less than 30 females and bulls.
The females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions are very similar to wolves or dogs, and are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also particularly lethal to their prey.
Being highly athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same panther group as the lion, the tiger, and the iguana. These four cats are the only ones that can howl.
The roar of the tiger is not like the lion's roar, it's more like a sentence of words shouted in exasperation.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals that the Ocelots prey on are much smaller than they are.
Scientists think that otters find prey and track them by smell, by sniffing the ground they've passed.
They can see perfectly in the dark using night vision, and also sneak in silently. Otcelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they arrived (such as if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
In this new environment there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they did before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments they did before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that they can't be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Moosaurus was the top predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other moosaurs.
Its long jaws were pierced by more than 70 sharp, razor-sharp teeth, and a second set of teeth was placed on the top of its mouth, meaning that anyone caught in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, large fish, other mussels, and he may even have been a cannibal.
In addition, it attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex could not have stood against it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have some odd or unusual items for celebration, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of rodent called the nymman.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich liked to have feasts where they were beaten on the side while they ate their meals.
It's impossible that ancient Roman meals included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
People would bring offerings to the gods and the priests would try to meet the gods' needs through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctified hall into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house didn't mean that much.
Most of the Jewish family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open porches facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and in his travels westward he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his findings, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each of the countries was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, rulers and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen a national treasure movie, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words, 'The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776.' " The text appears at the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that in the early days, the large card document (29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled for storage purpose.
So, it's likely that the additional markings are just labels.
The landings on the day of the Normandy invasion and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, who were Frenchmen who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and acted alongside the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called 'Operation Dragon.'"
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a very large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin word chibis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defines in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. Civilization culture suggests the transmission of knowledge between several generations, a cultural footprint and a relatively large distribution.
Minor civilizations often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States initially established a weak central government - with Congress as the sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax and, because it had no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the authorities in the states, which often did not cooperate, to enforce its laws.
And it had no authority to bypass the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The statute required unanimous consent from all the states before an amendment could be added, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.
"The Italian national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion".
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international events and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshū), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"In the case of the island group of Japan, it is usually defined as an 'archipel' from a geographical point of view".
"The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors passing nearby recorded the island's name as "Ilia Formosa", or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which prompted a change in traditional grain-growing practices and the employment of Chinese laborers in its rice and sugar mills.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1912-1644) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which had ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the compound have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu was restored and the restoration continues to this day.
"For example, the world's most common still photography format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era".
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio was inherited from the digital camera image format.
The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore the width-to-height ratio of this format (twelve parts to get the simplest integer ratio) should be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or close to this width-to-height ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been subject to a barrage of ridicule and abuse, is a simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the picture.
He states that the most effective place for the central subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into triangles vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was under severe criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has held the nations of Europe together despite differences in language and customs.
Her sheer power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the central beliefs in Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds are specifically designed for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to wonder if this principle has been preserved.
Shortly after the hostilities began, Britain laid a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, though the siege violated the conventional international rules that have been signed into a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had planted mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering whole areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its own unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the winning position of most citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horror and horrors of the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from ever occurring again.
"In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York".
"He came to the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor to Thomas Edison".
Ancient China had its own way of representing different periods of time; each stage in Chinese history or each ruling family had a unique dynasty.
There was also a period of unstable provincial divisions between the dynasties, most notably the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this time, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
In addition, after the revolution, professions were open to any man who wanted them, allowing the ambitious and the most successful to succeed.
This is true of the military because instead of the ranks being based on rank, they were now based on ability.
In addition, the French Revolution inspired many more of the oppressed working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He would often visit a cave known as the 'Hira' on the mountain 'Nur' (light) to immerse himself in the contemplation".
The cave itself, which has survived throughout history, provides a very rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave lies atop a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it at all even if you know it exists.
You can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The "upward arch" looks like a V and the "downward arch" like a peg or square without its lower edge".
Up means you start at the end and push the bow, and down means you start at the bow and pull the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own lyrics, but remember that the characters are there for a musical reason, so they should generally be adhered to.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse the 11-year-old and Louis-Charles the 4-year-old) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forcibly seated in the Palace of Versailles by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob of men shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their chariot windows wide.
At one point, a man from the crowd waves the head of a Royal Guard soldier killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a significant part of the expenses and interest on debt securities issued on behalf of the Philippine government through the banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted throughout the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from push technology or technological expedience to an acute sense that human destiny is based on reasoning beyond the laws of nature and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology development proceeds in a way that is not heavily influenced culturally or politically, and that technology has 'effects' on societies that are intuitive, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, we could say that the car is necessarily leading to development as roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning cars.
The proliferation of private cars also increases the frequency of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health to repair bodily injuries.
The Romantic movement contained a large element of cultural determinism inspired by writers such as Goethe, Pieta and Schägel.
In the context of the romantic movement, geography shaped human beings, and in the course of time customs and cultures associated with this geography arose, and these, thanks to their harmony with the place of society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a beacon of prestige began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
It declined in status during the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk dishes and spices whose value was higher than that offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was during this period that the fashion capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was deeply influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because of the slow channels of communication, styles in the West can lag 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western European countries began to develop their own style. One of the greatest developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to secure clothing.
Sustainable agriculture is agriculture designed to produce enough food to meet the exact needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable farming is a simple, often organic, method that uses preserved seeds from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and that's still the case in many developing countries.
Cultures cluster together people with similar views who feel disregarded by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture typically mark their membership through unique use of symbols in a style that includes fashion, slang, and slang.
One of the most common ways to teach the importance of socialization is to learn from the isolated, sad cases of children who, because of neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
"Such children are called 'wild children.' Some wild children have been incarcerated by humans (usually their parents); in some cases, child neglect has occurred due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical impairment".
Savage children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by nonhuman animals, a feral child exhibits behaviors (under physical limitations) almost identical to those of the animal that nurtured it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the peg method goes one step further.
Pygmies are not a learning method but rather a learning aid that supports people who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The pajamas can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are a form of pajamas but also the little paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Pygmas are embedded in software and designed to ask, respond to, and explain challenging processes that students may find difficult to handle on their own.
Children are sent to foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We think of the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to content.
"For example, it has been argued that 'learning' and 'communication' are important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational traits by Amy and Morard (1998) when they studied audience responses to websites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that take several thousandths of a second.
And in particular, it's claimed that you can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggested that such abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared by animals like domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two repositories of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
A mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection erases it from the existing pool of variation.
Segregation and recombination are mixing the differences back and forth between the two reservoirs with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most available plant resources were the available protein in the leaves and the roots, but for primates like us, it's hard to digest if it's not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in much the same ways that chimpanzees in the savanna do today".
Sleep paralysis is a process of deliberately falling asleep during your normal sleep time and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which would force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other time-based biorhythm options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known urinary stimulant) before bedtime, forcing the former to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of stress in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force is found.
The only thing that separates him from our goals is our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but this has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian yoga.
The core of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is aroused through yoga poses, breathing exercises, meditations and imagination.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the divine being, through visual thought of various divine beings, clearing the energy channels, activating the chakras, and creating the enlightened consciousness.
"Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. "By the end of the war, the contradictions of systems, processes and cultures had led to division between the countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
"It took place over the next 40 years and the actual fighting was carried out by armies "by means of the mail", "on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places".
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only chance was to retreat and re-assess along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, as more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian Fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country can keep moving your people and products, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and products.
One of the most prominent recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and material across the Atlantic to aid the British.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably succeeded in conquering Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for convenient access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who in many cases were children or adolescents, similar to the better-known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage tracks were built from only parallel wooden sources, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to carry larger loads than on the slightly more gravel roads of the period.
The cross-beams were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it gradually became apparent that the rails would be more efficient if they had a steel bar at the top.
It became standard practice, but the iron further dented the carriage's wooden wheels.
Eventually wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first railways were made of cast iron.
The first known form of mobility was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly as they did.
The ability to walk on two legs was found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, although the coelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become environmental activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
In many cases, it's just like symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to reverse it.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have intensified because of humanity's overpopulation and wasteful lifestyle.
After being approved by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Sleeves".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who recalled it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap scrolls that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But a lot of things in birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled and fertilized feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like a T. Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one or two values, i.e. 0 or 1, these numbers are treated as binary numbers  or bits, depending on the professional computer language.
Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they are not immediately diagnosable.
The best indication of internal poisoning could be the presence of an open medicine box or open bottles of household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions specific to this toxin.
Entomologists use the term bug in an informal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
Both bed bugs and fecal toads are nest-builders who have adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it still the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have a common cold.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in their child's best interests, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to do an adoption program for their baby.
When an adoption is made, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the child's parents.
The primary purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides most scientific research.
But it's not the only one -- an experiment, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and perform observations.
"Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible".
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior, which often depend critically on the presence of internal cycles, and on their being generated by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not just responses to external temporal cues, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining timers that continue for a certain period in constant cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked the DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in cells from the germ lineage can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in their cars to go to work and pass other people who are just where they left.
In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this enormous carbon economy has pulled the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same amount of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems drag such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply untalented? Or is something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the field that studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior tends to remain within a coherent range of logic; therefore, traffic flow generally has a logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we relate the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This fact gives them a wider range of small places where they can hide from the crazies.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are butterflies and hummingbirds.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite to be true; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and other stars).
It makes sense, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with a water volume eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at sometimes six miles wide.
20 percent of the water that flows through the Earth's tunnels into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
"The central Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and draws water from thousands of smaller rivers".
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom period, no building could match the pyramids in size and constructional sophistication.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican Creed uses Italian in its legislation and in its official media.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of the people who work in the country, while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, developed the theory that everything was composed of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of aggregation of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also argued that they transform into new materials to create what we see.
Alloys are simply mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and calcium are considered metals.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them can fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, when it came into use, the pencil was a good friend to many people.
Sadly, with the advent of newer writing systems, the pencil's status declined and its use declined.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, and they never have to go near the sharp.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fusion bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy lifting cart, and splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called crust.
"The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side".
It's thinner under the edges and thicker under the edges.
There may be more lunar bodies on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding the same factor that drives people or charms them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are reinforced as they age.
These theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
"In general, two behaviors can break out when people become the managers of their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain 'one of the guys.'"
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything the crew has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends up in a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are required to the same professional standards as regular teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as liaisons with their physical team.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The "invisible team" is the management team to which all team members are subordinate. The invisible team sets the benchmarks for each team member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the resources available in all the functional departments of an organization are used effectively, creativity and freshness can emerge.
As a result, a process of organizing the employee together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the customer's need.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the sequence approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to consciousness research, so it narrows the scope of the research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with much of the information and material needed to build blood models that help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI raises a strong connotation of science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptive intelligence of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves developing machines to automate tasks that require predictive behavior.
Examples include control, planning and time management, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, in addition to handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military. It has also been implemented in a number of home computer programs and computer games.
Tours play a big role in every classroom. Often a teacher will be happy to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology provides the solution through virtual field trips. Students can look at museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or marvel at beautiful art while sitting next to their classmates.
Sharing a virtual tour together is also a great way to observe the trip and share future classes in experiences.
For example, every year students from the North Carolina Bennett School build a site on their trip to the state capital, and every year the site is redesigned, but old versions are kept online to serve as a souvenir book.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy spelling and typing, audience presence often changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to aspire to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also 'counsels students to become more aware of the world around them.'" The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs ""should empower students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their own position in the context of others' writing, as well as their own viewpoint on certain issues (Oraver, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's delightful bilingual capital, with a variety of galleries and museums that represent Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the home of the pristine natural beauty of Muscocca County and beyond.
All of these and more make Ontario seem like an outsider to a typical Canadian city.
Large areas north of there are relatively sparsely populated and some are barely populated wilderness areas.
"A comparison that surprises many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens".
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean just off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by a wide margin, and a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states, or associated with France, and are known as luxury coastal resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it bought a wide grip in the Comoros and Miwot.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, with the discovery of the footpath from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for every traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also good to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they would have seen as harassment, and that it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their pants, etc.
Be honest in your rejection of men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yours (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it a mess!).
"The modern city of Casablanca was founded by barbarian fishermen in the 10th century BC, and used the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anapa".
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco as Dar al-Bayda and was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading centers there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the Old Country, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan items, such as Tajikine, pottery, leather goods, handkerchiefs, and a whole range of small items, but all for the sake of the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002 a lava flow from the Mount Nyiragongo volcano destroyed most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Goma is relatively safe, but any visit outside Goma should be checked to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Mount Nyirongo, along with some of the cheapest trails in Africa to follow the mountain gorilla.
You can use a Bodh-Bodh (motorcycle taxi) to get around the dome. The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolais francs for a short ride.
"In combination with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands".
Today, Timbuktu is a wealthy city, though it is also a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger of desert sands.
"This was one of the main stops during the Henry Louis Gates special on PBS's 'Wonders of the African World.'"
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
"The park spans over 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting different wildlife".
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are two-day park maintenance and entry fees.
You may also want to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to select parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that tourists to Robin regard as a major focus.
The row of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart that is revealed by the presence of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon coastline opposite.
The vast majority of urban development in Hong Kong is concentrated in landlocked areas along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers saw their place, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
"The Sundarbans is the largest free-floating mangrove belt in the world, stretching from the coast 50 miles into the interior of Bangladesh and India".
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But forests are not just mangrove swamps - they contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indo-Gangetic plain.
"The Sundarbans covers 3,850 square kilometers, "of which one-third is covered by water or grassland".
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave the Inter-Provincial Bus Station (across the river) during the day, although most, especially those facing east and Jakar/Bomtang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since inter-provincial buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Bhutanese NGL) and Phuket (200 Bhutanese NGL).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the towns of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint George de L'Oiapoque, French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 273 feet, its length is 1,100 feet, and it has two lanes that are ten feet wide.
The minimum height below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The tent is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, so expect Brazilian customs checkpoints to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaicuru and Paixuan, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
"Sixteenth-century Paraguay, once called the 'Great Province of the Indians,' was born as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three hundred years.
Since the founding of the Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for its polo team and its players who are some of the best in the world.
The big tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Canitas Polo Grounds.
You can also see smaller tournaments and games here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and places to buy tickets to polo games, look at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) which is defined as the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound will be accepted everywhere in the islands and within Stanley often credit cards and US dollars will be accepted as well.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American money may be accepted. Check in advance with the owner to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so they exchanged money before leaving.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so when it's summer in the northern hemisphere, it's winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the dark makes it look.
"There are no defined seasons of 'rainy' and 'dry': the amount of rainfall remains constant throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you should keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wildlife!
No matter how comfortable they look, buffalo, Canadian deer, reindeer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance.
Also, it is good to know that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so do not carry on your body and do not cook smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
"The harbour was the site of a famous naval dispute from 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour".
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Germans and Englishmen lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by Mao's movement, the peaceful mobs in the city brought about the assassination of the supreme leader Tofu Tamasha for the third championship.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is spread over two islands. The most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches safe for swimming, and most of them have shade provided by the pohotokawa trees.
The headwaters of Tamaki Drive are at the Waitemata Harbour, on the expensive outskirts of Mission Bay and St. Hilaires in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded with a great variety of shops along the coast.
"The main local beer is 'Number One,' it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta.'"
There are plenty of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more durable on the road.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but for those who are apprehensive, bottled mineral water is very easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a flat white coffee is unfamiliar. A short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes with plenty of cream (not cream), and a tea is served without milk.
Standard Belgian hot chocolate, expensive fruit juice but very good.
Many trips to the reef are made year-round, and injuries from any of these factors are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cuban jellyfish appear near the coast and in the river flows from October to April of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these periods.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will stay away from them.
Saltwater sharks do not live actively in the ocean, their main breeding habitat being the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace and security that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel accommodation.
They can also save the order for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should go through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to stay on site, and most attendees see this as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you'll need to get in early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages may have ended, there may still be areas of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas for families with children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cell, as ice crossing makes a pretty terrible noise in the cells most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements.
Typically, casinos go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend there. Windows and clocks are often not present, and it is not easy to find the exit.
They often have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them on the premises.
Some places offer alcohol on the house, but getting drunk impairs judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy roads, low friction, you can't drive like you would on bare asphalt.
In a blizzard, enough snow to stick to you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing in the wind, or by fog or ice on car windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs largely uninterrupted all year round.
Safari tours are perhaps Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the crowning glory for many travelers.
The term safari in popular usage refers to cross-country trips to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will make them comfortable to watch.
Lions, cheetahs and tigers are sometimes shy and you'd be able to see them better with a mirror.
"A walking safari (also called a "grass walk", "backpacking safari", or "running out") consists of a walking tour of several hours or days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flights and overnight stays before the postponement was announced, you may have run into trouble.
There is a range of cancellation policies, but since the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not cover until July 2020, the date set for the Olympics.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with most tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have a welder and a ironing board available for hire, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a freezer, or if you don't care about wearing socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful that the vent does not overheat (which can cause a contraction, or in extreme cases, a burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others it takes a few minutes.
The efficiency of different filters is not constant, and if you have any concerns, you might want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Hikers may encounter pests unfamiliar to them from their native areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Self-infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can brutalize or kill people, are often not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from VAT and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Upstate-Pittsburgh highway, and it often passes through desolate and isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on the alert: there are many steep steps, narrow lanes, and sharp bends along the way.
"The posted speed limits are considerably lower than the previous and upcoming sections - usually 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/ h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual".
Strangely enough, cell phone reception is much stronger here than along many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, it's rich and varied, similar to those in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit maples are common. Apple maples can be found all year round while cherries and plums come in the summer.
Many German meals also contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Popular pastries are usually especially suited to a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich baked goods, try what we call according to the different regions Berliner, Panneuken or Karfen.
Curry dishes are dishes based on spices and herbs, in addition to meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquids".
In the mainland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term covering a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
But when used without further description, the term refers to food that originated in the central and eastern regions of the island of Central Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of plainly prepared dishes, and the prominent flavors favored by the Javanese are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (primarily Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
Riding crops provide support for the rider's legs, which are suspended from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught in the saddle, he may be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders use riding boots with smooth, hard heels and soles.

Think of a ski trail as a kind of nature trail.
In good conditions you can cover greater distances than walking - but very rarely will you get the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on trails trained for it.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries requires the visa application and passport control process to be repeated many times.
