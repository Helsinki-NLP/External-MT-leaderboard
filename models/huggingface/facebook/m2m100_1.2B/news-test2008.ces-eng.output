Inflation in Europe rises due to food prices
The accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the steady rise in food prices.
In November, price growth in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, with an annual inflation of 3.1% recorded in October after 2.6%, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union said.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower its base interest rate, saying that a reduction, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to keep inflation below 2% but close to it.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must “distract” inflation so that it will not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, the November inflation rate of 3.3 percent represents a fifteen-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the eurozone has risen due to rising food and energy prices.
Terminal wheat prices rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybean has reached its highest since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
Oil prices on the world markets rose 52 percent this year and last month a barrel of black gold already cost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent in 2008 to 2.5 percent this year, but will drop to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain approximately at 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
Following a long-standing stagnation in early December, the Fidesz group has grown significantly, making it the largest group since 2002, while in the case of the socialists, the Gallup Institute has never sought such a low - 13% support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference – due to the greater determination of the opposition voters – would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to a fifth support for MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entry into parliament: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the voters, there are two percent more supporters.
Public opinion on the economy has worsened even with regard to the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families are now again more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after the spring and summer more hopeful prospects.
As for next year, a larger part of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, the highest number of Gallup polls to date, said the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
Ference Gyurcsány believes or very believes 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán has a 38 percent share of supporters.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54 percent, while the leader of the Fidesz is not trusted by 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be addressed without changing the government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent considered the remainder of the government and the prime minister to be desirable, at present this share is only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the announcement of new elections.
For the interest in the referendum is characteristic that 60 percent of respondents answered a question regarding their possible participation that the referendum would definitely come and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
For comparison, “the parliamentary elections held this Sunday” would be attended by only 55 percent and another 15 percent considers their participation likely.
The school would say no to 74, the doctor’s fees to 79 and the hospital fees to 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people promising their participation, then the introduction of tuition fees, doctor fees and hospital fees would reject 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth lowered Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangleined last year’s average 16% price level growth, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Posts in Napi Ekonomia
The usual Christmas consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaorsk trade triangle this year increased by an average of 16 percent, but in all hypermarkets the price increased by over 1,000 forints.
As prices in food supermarkets "flown" already last December, the percentage did not show such a drastic increase in prices due to the previous high base.
For consumers, however, it is unhappy that what they could calmly buy at a price of less than nine thousand forints last year will not be purchased for ten thousand.
The consumer basket of the Daily Economy in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological boundary of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003 the consumption basket cost 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but cruel breasts, nuts and also maca were very expensive.
The prices of bread and flour matched the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Likewise, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, however, according to the consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the consumer basket of Napi Gazdaság raised Cora by 15 percent compared to prices last Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent.
When compared with last year’s highest and lowest value of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21 percent.
Forints increased by an average of 1,488.
The average price increase last year was 1,206 forints, with prices influenced by the increase in VAT during Christmas last year.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the shops were obviously unable to decide how much price range they should set for individual products, as they were unable to predict what effect the change in prices would have on consumption.
(If a trader plans the rate of circulation of a given product incorrectly, he may lose a significant profit due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year’s rise in the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1.220 forints higher than in 2006, while the price difference of the cheapest basket was 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not appear, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest priceed 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic price growth emerged, in less than 20 months, daily consumer goods in hypermarkets dropped by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, does not completely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured in the case of several basic foods price increases exceeding 30 percent over a 12-month period.
Except for eggs, for example.
In the latter case, however, according to the Daily Economy consumer basket, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, showed a price growth of just over 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Powder suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, with drastic price increases being promoted in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business gold triangle are not complaining, they are still referring to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Everything is purchased in quantity, and sustainable food is taken by salary.
On Wednesday morning, long queues were formed in all three supermarkets, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in the countryside the turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research firms that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also durable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are used.
More than a thousand cases of infection have been in hospitals this year, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overcrowding of personnel do not help stop the infection, the primary of the National Epidemiological Center said.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but soon afterwards he had to return with an MRSA infection and because of the bacteria found in his body, one important operation could not have been performed.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröcz, primary of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been confidently recorded in hospitals, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant gold staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria is carried by one-third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered in excessive or inappropriate amounts, a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics will develop into a bacterium that is very resistant to antibiotics and spreads rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, such as morning infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the top doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are a daily practice in hospitals.
“Infection should not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not just there,” Tibor Nyulasi said, “where the presence of a disease-causing agent is not investigated.”
Resists antibiotics
“We isolate these patients, the care staff treats them in rubber gloves and in a mask and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them,” Nyulasi said.
Patients who are admitted to the hospital are first examined to see if MRSA is present in their bodies, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion.
The overwhelming majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favourable for the prevention of the emergence and spread of multiresistant disease agents, says Karolina Böröczová.
As this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should check patients and immediately isolate MRSA carriers.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
The National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these tests.
Most cases are revealed if the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, the primary of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate treatment with antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in primary and ambulatory treatment of patients, Karolina Böröcz said.
Saving on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is spread among patients most often through medical staff.
Therefore, handwashing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also serious deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in the conditions of home hospitals.
The rooms, on the other hand, are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
As Karolina Böröcz pointed out, unfortunately, we can also encounter the fact that in hospitals that are in a disadvantaged material situation, they are saving on disinfectants, there are few caregivers and many patients, thereby increasing the chance of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are proved to be fewer or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is an enormous cost for health insurance companies, so it is being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has drafted a program for preventing MRSA and reducing its incidence.
As it seems, the program is successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a declining trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens as its priorities.
The police officer who caused the accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII. district, who caused a fatal accident, is completed.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII. district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who has resigned in the meantime, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs, Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office of the capital, said on Friday after an expert’s assessment of the case was completed.
The expert assessment confirmed the outcome of the initial investigation, which already concluded that the former police captain did not drink any alcohol before sitting behind the wheel.
The then director of the police headquarters of the XXII. district struck on Tuesday in the street of Lajos Kossutha in the XXII. district with his own car when turning a fifty-five-year-old man, who entered in front of him when crossing the road outside the designated passage.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian passed outside of the zebra, by the way, according to the rules of road traffic is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car must still give preference.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned and requested to be transferred to the service, according to a police statement because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the outset.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks worth €400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a framework of €300 million for Hungary’s budget financing of projects in the field of transport and the environment, implemented with the support of the Cohesion Fund, with the parties already concluding a loan agreement for the amount of €100 million, now signed the agreement concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
A loan agreement of €150 million is also available for budget financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining €150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for 50 million euros, which the budget will be used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also a discussion on the fourth route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the subway financing, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
This could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary in the amount of EUR 8.4 billion.
Interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without commitment commission shall be bound by the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the paradise of the European Union
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is overwhelming - the attention of all Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying on the cheapest yet fastest rising EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for real estate purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
Of the mountains are most in the course of the areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the interest of investors will also be aroused by the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more interested people are also shopping in the vicinity of the expansively cheap city of Ruse.
Also, the capital city of Sofia is a promise of tempting options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, becoming a sought-after destination in addition to the summer and winter seasons for two more seasons.
Forecasting investors are already buying in large, for example, in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but there are also buyers from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors here, and there are traditionally many Russian customers near the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or lost old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good availability and communication opportunities, the proximity of a big city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category are chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of rising value in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate in the capital is continuous, as demand is increasing.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but has grown by 21% annually over the past five years.
The rise in real estate prices significantly exceeds the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to the information of the Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gabor Fodor, the meetings of experts will be concluded on Tuesday, and after Wednesday's official opening, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with ministerial talks.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are negotiating the Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts following the emissions reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
There is a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The United States has also announced that it is not now willing to negotiate precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question at the conference is whether developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are dependent on it.
The agreement also includes subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by a 16-member management board, probably within the framework of the United Nations World Environment Programme (GEF) - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate protection efforts and to contribute to a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "deal after 2012", and is ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30 percent if other developed regions of the world, respectively, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 blamed themselves for a reduction target of 5.2 percent, with the then 15 EU member states committing to 8 percent.
The commitment of Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill.
In Bali, a long-term international agreement on climate change policy needs to be reached within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be delayed until 2012. In such a case, a new emission reduction scheme would not immediately be imposed on the Kyoto Protocol’s commitments to reduce emissions, which the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, also pointed out in its latest report.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reduction and an inevitable rise in average Earth temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to the scientists.
British army recruits on YouTube
British military units are publishing on a video-sharing server recordings of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, by which they popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) liked YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of actions against the Taliban here since March 2006, the BBC.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are monitored by the Air Force Command in charge of combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent further to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
In this form, 139 records of British Air Force soldiers have been posted on the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have viewed their channel.
The British Ministry of Defense registered in the spring of 2007 as “defenceheadquarters” and publishes recordings of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released videos according to its original intention for recruitment purposes and, according to the Defense Ministry, are good even to familiarize the general public with the real goal of military presence abroad.
“Propaganda published in this form compared to traditional television recruitment advertisements costs almost nothing,” said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert at the BBC, “but it necessarily carries a certain political message as it confirms the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government in a special form.”
The Americans played.
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also sent to the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in somewhat hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers speak about losses, but the bloody image of the fight is not shown.
Many videos of combat sites in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been posted on the Internet, but the British army has only been able to find them now.
Americans do the recruitment a little differently – using a shooting game called America’s Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get straight into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less loyal simulation.
In the ministries will be Christmas with tombol and pagáčky
Minister of Labour Mónica Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will arrange a final working meeting for her employees, at which she will say goodbye to the year 2007 with cupcakes and coffee.
Some ministries will celebrate with live music, others will enchant the officials with a Christmas atmosphere with a bottle and a welcome drink.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - so the powerful have fun.
Officials are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defense will host the most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year, but does not expect its employees to attend it.
On the Christmas of the orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, on the Mission Christmas they will host family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are out of line with other departments.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4 320 000 forints, and from the six hundred employees of the ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will adhere to the Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a tombola will be drawn.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the State Justice Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
The rental of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
One department of the NFÜ appears to be invited to another Christmas celebration: the tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG), will organize it with EU funds.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information, as we have not been able to find the relevant person.
No Dress Needed
The OIT building was hosted not only by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucia Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
However, the OIT did not want money from him for the use of its halls.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with a greeting of the minister, after dinner it was possible to dance accompanied by live music.
According to the answer to the portal [origo] question, there was no compulsory evening dress or costume at all at the ball.
The Puritan Party is organized by the departments of health, labor and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Labour Minister Mónica Lamperth even officially invites the employees not to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests, who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and cupcakes, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Local Government Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas gathering, which is expected to be attended by 436 employees, in its own large hall.
He spends 2,500 forints per guest on a Christmas party - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a welcome drink.
Since being Minister János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party, however, will be missing, the officiality will strengthen not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The agriculture resort hosts a New Year's reception on January 20, ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the City Halls and, according to the Ministry’s announcement, 1,000 forints per person will be allocated for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
The annual reception begins with a short greeting of the Minister and ends with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold the Christmas party at all, the corresponding press departments told the [origo] portal.
The price of the Christmas celebrations was not announced by the environmental department in the press department.
Four hundred people were invited to the event at the Museum of Art.
Going to a massive strike
The League and the National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ) will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s unlimited strike.
A protest public assembly will be held on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - work will be stopped.
The action will cause serious traffic disruptions, as railway traffic will be almost completely stopped and employees of the Budapest Transport Enterprise (BKV) will also strike by 13 o'clock.
On Friday afternoon, the League association, together with the National Union of Workers’ Councils, will present the details of the jointly organised Monday strike.
A strike commission will also be formed, which will coordinate the action on Monday.
A protest public assembly will take place on Saturday, and since Monday, unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If the Parliament does not finally pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted out, the strike committees will meet and decide on the further procedure.
According to the agenda of the Parliament’s meeting on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted only late in the evening or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, it is possible to count on serious traffic disruptions: on the railway, work will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning, part of Budapest's public transportation and more than half of Volán companies can stop.
At the same time, half of the road will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous unions and civil society organizations have joined the strike call, whose list is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations have announced an indefinite strike, while others have declared a temporary shutdown.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while the beginning of the Christmas holidays more and more people travel by rail.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike from the start of operation until 13 o’clock, from 7 to 9 o’clock in the morning at the Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike is organised by the Labor Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, and the Labor Union of Pedagogues and the Democratic Trade Union of Pedagogues has called for a 2- and 2-8-hour stop of work.
The Hungarian Union of Physicians will strike alternately across the country, while the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions in force from next year will be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, the possibility of inclusion in the system of early retirement for the respective occupational sectors should be ensured before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the League trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, established with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The company’s “warning on risks” states that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that “the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary can lead to violent ethnic clashes in a short time.”
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is likely aimed at provoking such an action, adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligences of Hungarian political leaders: “The public discussion on the Roma question was left by the officials of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction.”
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, influenced by the great attention of domestic and foreign media, “have largely damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity”.
Part of the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which since the fall of 2006 has been receiving increasing publicity and popularity, is that in Hungary since the summer of 2007 several organizations have been formed, which call themselves associations of "national defense".
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly proclaiming – even armed – the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, attacks on the homeland, disruption of order), plus pointing to the inability of the police, the army, or the state,” he adds.
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap all kinds of political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and parties into civilian clothes.
Therefore, the emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups serves not only to avoid the legal obstacles of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor increasing the risk also in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighboring countries as a potential source of danger, and the ultranacionalist political leaders of some neighboring countries have appealed to the formation of the Hungarian Guard to excuse their own anti-Hungary policy.
All this could have an impact on the political stability of the region,” he added.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a rare phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
The activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, the creation of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are massive Roma riots that erupted in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
This was used by the BNU to establish the Guard, stating that the organization’s goal is “national defense.”
In the past 17 years there has been a “Gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, according to the Political Capital Institute.
He added that the initiative sparked a fierce debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increased risk of ethnic clashes is signaled by the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will set up their own guard in the sign of resistance.
As the previous activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own defense, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, told the press office: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform the public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not everywhere.
In Hungary, holidays are precisely stipulated by law and it has become a common practice to move working days around holidays, which is less likely to happen next year.
Neither in the United States nor in the European Union there is a common holiday.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and national holidays and days of rest.
Working days are mostly associated with church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a work holiday - in the New Year already so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
During the year there are 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the founding of the state, on the 1st of May work, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two days of Easter, Summer and Christmas holidays.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
The price for prolonged weekends is, of course, that we stay at work and at school on the previous Saturdays.
When the day immediately preceding or following the holiday is worked, the Minister of Labour has been regulating in a special decree for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers employed by them, to public servants and to persons in public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or operate even during days of rest.
This year, there will be a change in the working rules only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to previous experience, most people will "work" in advance the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve or take advantage of the saved holiday.
In the coming year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively, at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is turned around a work holiday, so that then workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day, so Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, it will work instead of Friday, 24.
At the end of the year, however, next year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of holidays, because from December 24, they will have almost everywhere nonstop holidays even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six scary things you can make your colleagues angry with
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies we barely notice: all this “spread” the everyday workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these small inconveniences, or if you put on gloves, and you will deliberately avoid unclear situations that can make others angry.
Types
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague tells you.
Have you missed the mountain because of that?
In the best case, he regrets and tries to fix it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Sometimes the problem is solved with an excuse.
Before it comes to embarrassing apologies, it is good to think about how you can prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you stretch for some writing, office needs, or for your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember yesterday you put a sewing machine on the table, but by morning it’s gone?
Or did you find your pen on a colleague’s table that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without your permission, otherwise they will be rightly angry with you that you are grabbing them in things.
Do not take out envelopes or sticky paper from the office, as it can be unpleasant if you get rid of them prematurely and you will need them immediately.
The private life of your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the spread of rumors.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t let anyone know about your personal life!
When any of them shares their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse their trust!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Do you report your absence without reason?
If you call the office and, referring to a severe headache, report your absence because you are not well, or say to yourself that you would rather rest today, think of the fact that your work, urgent tasks and work, to which they have a certain deadline, will have to be done by someone else for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you won’t go to work the next day, or that something can happen that makes you have to stay at home, announce it so that your colleagues and executives don’t face your absence until the next day.
Snooping, Snooping, Phoneing
Have you plunged into a job from which you will be brutally pulled out by a crazy colleague?
Are you witnessing a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your colleagues by ringing, singing, loud calling (on top of their heads), or duping, constant cries, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disturbing even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, don’t blame someone else for your forgetfulness!
Do not reflect on the potential chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask yourself how you could put things in order, correct the negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Clothes and shoes: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear clothes for leisure even if your profession allows it.
Don’t be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dresses – and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to fit, he ceases to be interesting
Riding in the usual morning constipation.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of a violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
Add the noise.
The music changes the pace and the previous tone colours are added to the bass, then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
On mr2, Zagar performs a song called Wings of Love.
For a long time, the music industry hasn’t had a good quality of electronic music.
Suddenly, but constipation looks quite different because you’re just listening to Zagaru’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the domestic digital underground slowly changes the overall picture, and although garage rock is back in fashion with its guitar beat, even the domestic electropop proves there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five-Castle and also he played in Yonderboi’s band, until he eventually – because two dogs don’t fit into one chard – went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, however, he began to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Török’s “Season”
His formation, playing at the beginning in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the fifty most important home albums and declared Zagar in Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entity determining the development that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in the course", although, of course, no one has asked them if they are satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open up new paths for them, although the title itself seeks to make a follow-up to the initial Five-Castle flights.
This is one verse from the song of the old band Balázs Zságer.
A reference to etheric, flying would be in place, but beside the etheric breath of this music has now appeared - in line with the spirit, the trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, was introduced at the debut of the album in Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music from morning to evening, we began to grab the smelly melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is okay (?).
The portal hvg.hu confessed Balázse Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, how much does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of marginal music does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different casts of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they say nothing, and just so can only arise for the sake of selling, making it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can originate from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is accepted also works, regardless of language and national boundaries.
HVg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially from us in the west, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people over twenty who go to the concerts, but also the elderly.
Many more watch the transformations of light music taking place around them, as they also consider it to be a part of contemporary culture.
Q: What is the role of the public in your work?
Do you care who, where and how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we’ve never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more at concerts, where the mutual influence already works, but it is hidden only in the irresistible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I’ve noticed that when a person wants to suit the audience, from that moment on he ceases to be interesting.
HVg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboie’s example?
He worked solo and built his career from us to the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t actually go his way, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music.
We are more team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, we couldn’t avoid our work being compared to Yonderboie’s songs, because a few of us separated from his band and took a different path.
In the top list of mr2 Petőfi, the song Wings of Love got the first place.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
With a more popular style, have you consciously opened up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn’t have any plans to write a hit that would sell a record.
This song is more.
We intended it as the final of the album, with which we tried to release the previous sound orgia and more complex themes.
Q: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of composing this choir from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir—Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh—was brought together, which we then crossed into Underground Divas.
HG: Is this exactly what you intended to do with the song, or did the girls transform something into it?
B.Zs.: The song had long existed in the instrumental version, and when the material came together on the record, we thought we needed something more for this song.
The sequence of accords led to the addition of a singing part to it.
Even that night, I sang a song that the girls later learned.
It all happened very spontaneously and very spontaneously.
I remember how it revived, but of course miracles were needed to do so.
With my voice, it’t work that hard.
HVG.hu: As on the record, as on the concert, there seemed to be girls in the background.
They don’t have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don’t have their own role, they sing completely together, and they’re not louder than the music, so the music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They also stood behind the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: That they stood behind was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to share solo roles was intentional, on the contrary.
The song is about forgetting a little about our ego, where we are from, where we belong, and just letting ourselves be lifted up by those wings, the wings of love.
I wished that the euphoria that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
Q. Which one has worked the most?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music actually not with one, heavier pieces occurred rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work groove, then everything pretty slowly found its place as in some puzzle.
Q: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That’s always changing with the concert and the fact that I’ve already released the album.
Prophet is a fool, escape from the earth and never the same.
The betrayal broker risked billions from inferiority
A fraudulent defrauder.
Jerome Kerviel is a French banking giant, Société Générale, the owner of the Commercial Bank.
It has lost almost 5 billion euros.
Rather, however, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and, moreover, definitely not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, it has recognized a crisis in the American mortgage market.
“He’s mentally weaker,” he said from the mouths of his superiors, who sent the police to him.
According to Kerviel’s statement by French media, Le Monde, he was the man who at the end of last year had profits of €1.6 billion.
Not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in a statement.
In the summer, he made half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, will be in trouble.
The crisis had no impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
At the end of the year, its profit reached 1.6 billion euros.
“When I made the first half-billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t leave anything for himself.
During the interrogation, he admitted that he had falsified records so that he could not be found.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange began to be interested in his business.
Risk is profit
Was he afraid to come to him?
Rather not.
“I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where did he get the will to take such risks?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 shortly after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“Already in my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first big success.
Thanks to the shares Allianz earned, in the bombing attacks on London wagered on the decline of this title half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism – he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we will leave you.
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew everything, or rather guessed it.
"While I was making money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the wound at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
During the weekend in mid-January, he went out.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
How did they come to him?
He was arrested because of his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look into his records,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to earn $356 billion.
The Czech government and the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros in the coming years.
This is approximately half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will receive approximately SEK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to $150 billion, will go to transportation.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational program and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage with the amount of SEK 90,8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme aims to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more efficient organizational methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries to receive funds from the EU.
Nicaraguan ex-president sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday confirmed a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud reaching $100 million ($1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison, according to the AP, is not clear at the moment.
According to the head of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to prison officials to decide whether Alemán will be sentenced at home or whether he will be sentenced to prison.
Four years ago, a court found that Alemán regularly transferred government funds to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in the fund that Alemán founded to fund his 2001 election campaign.
We have approved the budget.
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year last year passed with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by the Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford its non-acceptance.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote of no-confidence to the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives passed this traditionally overlooked, though most influential, law quietly.
This is a certain paradox.
Every governance begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or dislikes it.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind a power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
This is more medially grateful and is therefore paid much more attention to it in the media.
Guessing politicians is much more interesting to the public than strict numbers.
The state budgets in the past social-democratic governments suffered from three difficulties that the one for 2008 is unable to solve at once:
The first is the high proportion of mandatory expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent “coalition” of ČSSD and KSČM last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit management as a consequence of the deficit of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of municipal and municipal budgets.
But the biggest problem is not the budget deficit.
It is public and relatively controlled.
However, the time bomb is the deficit of municipal and municipal budgets.
Many mayors, in order, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, to obtain additional resources for investments, often headlessly issued bonds by which they disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by selling massive shares of energy and other distribution networks, which they have received from the state from privatization.
They no longer have that source.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, just like the rest of the world, thus constantly boasting ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
The state is increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, especially for the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are the least at risk of poverty globally.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, just in recent years have unnecessarily swelled into gigantic dimensions.
Even though it has succeeded in abolishing part of the senseless populist spending approved this year before the elections, so if the border of retirement and pension reform is not moved in the near future, then in fact any policy in this country will end and no matter who governs, it will be mere administration.
With a little exaggeration it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the suppression of normal spending by mandatory spending.
The planned deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be completely useless if the previous governments had not managed in the last ten years as much as they could.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and give peace to this not too strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can spend only as much as it can earn on taxes and taxes, to prepare further reform laws.
This is the only way to a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly tackle the financial market crisis.
More than $100 billion will be raised through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will send $40 billion to auction, and another $24 billion will be available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This move is meant to address the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing shortage of free capital that banks could borrow,” Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect additional billions of dollars.
“Central banks need to be really concerned about what might be next when they decide to take this step,” said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend to their customers as well.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into a recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks made this decision after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for borrowing money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about borrowing money from each other, despite the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain having lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central bank’s move will help fuel the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Ecologists are incredible
Climate change affects developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke about global warming.
This was announced at the end of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he said that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which is made up of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality, unacceptable.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president, when presenting his book, emphasized that its topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so engaged to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter cartoons of my opinions."
So now, the interested can read his untouched positions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climate scientist, but he believes he has sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and evaluate professional discussions, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus of all scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as a person with totalitarian experiences, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.”
On the same topic Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver’s license has been exchanged for 600,000 people.
More than 600,000 drivers have missed the deadline and have failed to exchange their old driving license, which will expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for an exchange, so that the authorities can still issue a new passport by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the road without a valid license after the New Year.
According to the authorities, the license was not exchanged, especially for those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in changing a driver’s license, authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by requests and interest in changing a driver’s license has risen this week.
The company serves around 2,000 clients per day.
They wait about half an hour on the fronts.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers have not changed their driving licenses yet.
The issuance of a new passport takes 20 days.
It is possible to request extradition within a reduced period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay $500.
Drivers who fail to change their license before the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver’s license will be subject to fines from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
A police officer can also deal with the offence.
In the event of an administrative offence, the penalty will be up to £2,500.
According to previous information, a person who did not go anywhere could also be fined by the city council.
He said he could have paid 30,000 crowns.
Earlier, the ministry urged the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum of a thousand crown fine.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karla Hanzelka, however, ten thousand fines do not threaten anyone.
A driver’s license is a document that allows people to decide whether they want it or not.
This is not a passport that everyone needs to have.
Those who do not want to drive should withdraw their driver’s license.
It is sufficient to take it away or send it by mail to the competent municipal authority.
At the end of the year, licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
Drivers will also need to change their driving licenses gradually.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange.
The licenses issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are approximately 2.6 million additional documents.
Court reduces sentences for detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are charged with a criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to 13 and 10 years in prison.
This was decided by the Supreme Court of Prague, which reduced the sentences to one by one year and to the other by two years.
The detectives of the Prague Committee for Combating Organized Crime were threatened to be 14 and 12 years old.
The decision can no longer be appealed, only appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but is still waiting for a first-instance verdict.
In other cases, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
He can’t get more.
The district court in January found 19 people guilty of participation in the robbery assaults, the Supreme Court today settled the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have rejected the indictment since the start of the investigation, saying it was an out-of-the-box case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, transferred information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped members of the gang avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent of the lump for Opavu and Konárík.
The prosecution concerns the gang's criminal activities from 1999 to 2001.
Especially the robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious health injuries, but also the abuse of public authority and illegal arming.
During home inspections, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, a laser targeting machine or a machine gun.
The gang allegedly stole tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to almost a dozen men in this trial, the courts have finally found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych area are still confessing in a different trial before the court, some cases have not yet been filed before the court.
The main trial has so far avoided Tomás Pót and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a definitive decision on their extradition to prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Accounts for child confusion: 12 million
For the confusion of children in the nursery, the lawyer of the injured families Igor Veleba wants the trebić hospital to compensate 12 million crowns, plus court expenses.
Three million for each mother, two million for each father, and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Therefore, the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál disagrees fundamentally with the proposal of Veleby.
"We reject such a request, which is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But in order to make an opinion about the counterproposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has drawn up.
Let’s see if it has any value at all.
We remain in the opinion that it will be in hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál said.
The amount is estimated to be between $100,000 and $200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňova family wanted a million crowns for every month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiating the compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Parents of children, according to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological injury and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced regrets that they did not prevent the confounding of newborns.
Women, in turn, are harder to cope with the actuality of trauma experienced and what is happening right now, Veleb summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola were exchanged by nurses at the trebić maternity clinic on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákovým to Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brožov and Jaroslav Trojanov to Jabloňov.
Heathman of Vysočiny Miloš Vystrčil handed over at the end of October to each of the families 100,000 crowns to compensate for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the trebić hospital, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of errors, they must go to the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts granted relatively low compensation to people, the amounts were calculated according to tables in the ranges of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup has lost the Kingdom of Wales
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Valašské královstvo brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava County Court, the name was used for the first time by the Valašský král, but the project was built by a long-time team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The party did not participate in the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is not likely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasiting on the popularity of Bolka Soup," Polívkov's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone in the words of the Valašské królestvo will equip just the actors and comedians.
Harabi has the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
“Getting money and inventing actions,” he said.
The reason for the dispute is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was a success and could have something out of it.
They want to parasitize our work,” he added.
Lucrative Business
According to the court, the name was used for the first time by the King of Wales in his TV show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Valaš passports.
From the original recessive action, trade and lucrative business activities emerged, to which Harabiš then linked the founding of the Valašské královstvo company.
In 1997, Soup agreed to include his name and signature in his passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Polívka published in a maneuver for his business intent.
“The popularity of the Boleslav Soup project of the Valašské královstvo helped,” the judge said.
She added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who intensively devoted themselves to him.
The cooperation of today-disputed parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for the Soup in Vsetíně.
Since then, however, disputes began to accumulate between Polivka and Harabiš, culminating in the ousting of "King Boleslav I elected for the furt".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court today rejected.
It could clearly bring to the dispute Harabiš’s planned trial for the throne and half the princess.
A new king should emerge.
He has not yet revealed the dates and details.
“We don’t want to hurry.
It should be like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can calmly sign up," Harabiš added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi Test: Disappearing Prejudices
I’ve never bought a Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of switching, steering and also production could be described anytime below average.
But now there is a successor to the Peugeot 207, and that is much better.
And the truck called SW goes a little further and I have nothing else to think about.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207, I complained about head space on the rear seats.
This is already the end of the complaint, because the car combi means that no two-meter longs will suffer in this direction.
Flying the World
I’ll go very fast so I don’t repeat too much.
This is a fairly successful design, where I have the only objection to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design inventions when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or roofs.
The side guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the car.
There is a lack of space above the head.
Baggage in Baggage
The main part of the car is its luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (and thanks to the folding back window) and as decent.
The deaf spots are equipped with retention tires, which are an ideal compromise.
It is able to stretch and hold even heavier objects.
But let’s stop over the volume together.
This is according to the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is a rather average value against the competition.
The best-selling car in the world is the ŠKODA Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladoboleslav product, then we find that Peugeot lags behind by a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when loading a car, this value is critical.
But if I should highlight the positive, I still have to mention a completely straight floor after the folding of the second row operators or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6 litre four-cylinder gasoline with a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, this should look like the 16th that drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it to a damaging similar, which sometimes acts as if it had a crimped cloth in the exhaust, I can only be excited about it.
Pricing says
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must keep in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a gasoline fourteen hundred for 329,900 CZK will still go away.
We have a total cost of $410 900, which is quite a bit.
The tested Premium equipment will then hit the equipment for an additional SEK 80,000 on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic switching, electric control of the rear windows...
The total cost of the car is 531 900 CZK.
It’s a lot, but count on the additional equipment at Fabia and you’ll get a very similar number.
Therefore, it is important to decide on the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
Children from Eastern Europe are increasing in British schools, raising concerns about the further development of local education among local settlers.
The integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children grow into violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Disputes, quarrels, and quarrels between students have also spread to the relationship between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham police arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with a iron rod.
The victim claims that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police were also forced to intervene after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The men were allegedly accused of giving racist comments and throwing stones at them.
“When we went home, a boy climbed the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to let go, he leaned on us with apples and pears, and then revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak students told The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local settler even described disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases indicate that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to get tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who have come here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right way.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and drunk cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
Only one island, but you will find a lot more and that is the island of Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by the human eye.
Havana became a warehouse and shipping place for treasures that the Spaniards in America plundered and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the U.S. (especially under the prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses have grown, cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 50s of the last century were riding on wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autographs on the walls of Bodegas in Havana.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you will get a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving around Havana, because the once imported jigulies and fiats in that salty and humid air have long since collapsed.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is largely lost, there are not so many colonial monuments in the vicinity as there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development has a green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another luxury, which is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by trainers.
One-third of the vast plantations were carried on steam and motor trains to sweeteners along narrow rails.
Their fleet has not been renovated for many decades, so there are functioning machines to be seen, whose peers are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
There is no need to talk about Varadero or Havana.
Remember that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway settlement and those who love this writer should not miss a visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the valley of Viňales in the west of the island.
Beautiful vegetation grows from a calcium base.
Mogots, limestone homoles and rocks are steeply raised from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has been captured in their cavities, thanks to which the winding rocks are also covered with thick pores.
The valley is the place where the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can visit one of Havana’s cigar factory.
Per it would be interesting for some to see that there was a Chilean part of Major Zemano.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth came from the slave trade and sugar trade.
Wealth transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has almost not changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is a place so remote that there was no road in the 1950s to connect this region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay aside.
Nothing was built there, and so nothing was bursting, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is also worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as the Playa Ancón beach, or the Cucumber Valley.
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after darkness and the music in it is silent in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
This approach really affects the path itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantanamo must cross high and cluttered mountains and pass through nature that human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern hill of Cuba was inscribed by UNESCO on the list of world heritage sites due to its unspoiled nature.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact, it was created about a hundred years after Columbus's sailing), and from the hill where the former castle and today's El Castillo hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the mountains of Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the santería, the African religions professed by descendants of former slaves, all of this could be described many pages.
But, as they say, it is better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
The shortage of troops and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not proceed as planned, the leaders of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight countries are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on NATO troops to be more active, Britain sees a priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and strengthening development aid.
“The developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
The next is to enable the people to start further economic and security development on their own,” Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
90 percent
U.S. military data show that Afghan rebels are at the highest level in five years.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have gotten to the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and ways to them,” Gates said.
This was stated by NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has been controversy among the countries involved as to whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany was criticized for passivity.
The Germans have a large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and fighting demands are not as high as we do in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British newspaper Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghans are exposed: the Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German newspaper Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt to be reduced to 1 trillion in 2009
The national debt of every Czech citizen exceeds SEK 84,000.
The total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government has planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to SEK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by SEK 40.2 billion.
Since June, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its debt data from the beginning of October.
Every citizen has a debt of over 84,000 CZK.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could not exceed the trillion crown limit until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora says: “We could get to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debt Grows
State debt is the debt of the central government and is generated primarily by the cumulative deficits of the state budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury vouchers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
Internal debt has so far increased this year by 38.5 billion to SEK 719.4 billion.
The foreign debt of the state this year has so far increased by SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called tradable state debt at the end of September reached SEK 803.3 billion and since June decreased by SEK 13.7 billion.
The average debt repayment period has risen to 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased by 13 percent in the first and third quarters, which is really a lot on how the economy is going.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade with when there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
According to the State Debt Management and Financing Strategy for 2007, the government planned to borrow SEK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly due to the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the predicted SEK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are planned at SEK 13.3 billion, the 10-billion reserve for retirement payments, the financing of state bonds of SEK 43 billion and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank of SEK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Chartum today for giving a name to a plush bear
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Chartum tribunal on Thursday evening and expelled, her lawyer said.
She was accused of letting six to seven-year-olds call the bear Mohammed, despite the prohibition to portray the prophet of Islam.
He was punished with a beat.
This 45-year-old British teacher, working at the Unity High School in Sudan's Chartum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after parents of several students filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in the month of September, when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-olds to choose a name for the class plush bear.
“Eight names will sound out of the children’s mouths, including Hasan, Abdulah and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
After a vote in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as their most popular name.
Mohammed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but it is a very common name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a bear accompanied by the inscription: "My name is Mohammed."
The bear did not wear a label with this name, but the problem is in depicting the prophet as an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, one of her Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name," he said, "it's just an innocent mistake."
Many of her students describe her as “very attentive to her students” and add that “she never talks about religion in the classroom.”
The name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What are the rules for using this name?
Is it possible to give them toys?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
Finally a failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded their sixth and final round of talks Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without overcoming their views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the two sides have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a news conference in Vienna.
His U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to peace and be ready for dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he said, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10
Negotiators of the Troika, comprising representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the population is Albanian-speaking, could appear in a brighter light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and last round of negotiations since the U.N. commissioned the Troika to conduct new negotiations in August.
The United States and the European Union are expected to conclude the talks on 10 December.
The Russians, who have previously blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue even after this deadline.
“Russia has been and remains in favor of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Bocan-Charchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
After eight years of international governance, the West sees Kosovo’s independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favor, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade is demanding greater autonomy.
“Unfortunately, we haven’t reached any agreement,” President Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters at the hotel in Baden, where the last chance talks were held on Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, the former commander of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past that led to murders and deportations."
“Dominic Effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is concerned about the "domino effect" in a region that is still unstable due to the wars for independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia, however, this does not mean,” he said, “that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right to veto.
“The European Parliament will have the last word.”
“For Serbia, only the Security Council solution is acceptable,” Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica said.
“These negotiations took two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council.”
He told reporters that “the last word on the status of Kosovo will be the parliament” and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking people, it would take place “by agreement” with the West.
Bush reaches agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened on his initiative, U.S. President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to start negotiations once and for all to resolve the 60 years-long dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides from the “roadmap” for peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aimed at "setting up a peace treaty that would resolve all unresolved issues without exception, including central issues."
This declaration includes three issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled during the 1948 conflict from their homes on the territory of today’s State of Israel.
Mr. Abbas took the word after the U.S. president, insisting that the subsequent negotiations should be "comprehensive and thorough" and touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others."
Olmert then spoke at the tribune, expressing the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it should be committed to closing them in the course of 2008".
Bush designated the end of 2008 as the deadline for the realization of his “vision of two states,” a Palestinian and an Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had accepted Bush’s commitment in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” said the Saudi prince in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper protected by the Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the black chronicle, the official version does not coincide with what is being told among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car passed through Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday shortly after 5 p.m.
“The vehicle was not in the interference mode, but was on guard and was driving at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, with no side lights on,” a police source said.
The green motorcycle of Kawasaki, "unregistered, and therefore without a permit to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, passed "at very high speed".
“The motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left after not giving preference to the right,” a police officer said.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the crew was negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, broken front glass, broken buffers) indicates the sharpness of the impact.
Marie-Thérèse de Givry, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of unintentional killing and non-assistance to persons at risk", which was also undertaken by the direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of the Val d'Oise District Police).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation led by IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
The three witnesses, who were interrogated on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police version, namely, that the minimotorka approached them relatively quickly from the left."
A sort of rift, undoubtedly caused by friction of the clips to the ground, yesterday revealed that both vehicles remained stuck until the police car managed to brake.
Vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical examination.
On the bodies of the two victims, an autopsy was done.
What happened, immediately afterwards?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, speeches spread rapidly among the people that police had to quickly leave the scene of the crime without providing first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN should, in all caution, also rule out “any serious misconduct” at this point.
“This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation that requires more investigation and with which we need to be very careful,” said a police source.
The daily "Libération" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed after the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident occurred.
“Immediately we and a cousin who is a nurse at the hospital ran down to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
I could do nothing.”
Then he saw “a whispering, completely frightened policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth was talking on the phone.
Faced with rapidly growing tensions and the confidence of those present that the situation of the young men is hopeless, police officers were taken away by the car of colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police departed."
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"No one should say that the police did not rush to help the young people.
These children were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions Increase in Pakistan
Pakistan's police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas grenades, which witnesses say were used by law enforcement forces.
The last men responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios to those in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
Some of them should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access roads to the Supreme Court were blocked by barricades on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were scheduled to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement gained the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president “invited the population to send flowers to the judges who opposed the state of emergency, and garbage to those who swore before Musharraf.”
“Musharaf’s promise does not apply”
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure declared on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election, which took place on October 6.
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, the president of the court, was removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is unlawful, unconstitutional and against the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the official told The News.
Musharraf’s promise to give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president “does not apply” after the state of emergency was introduced, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to renounce his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The deputy information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied the country’s ongoing speculation that the deputy chief of the army was to order President Musharraf house arrest.
More than one-third of pregnancies are unexpected.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one in three (36%) pregnancies are still unexpected today, according to a study led by the French Institut national d'études démographiques (INED) - the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
The legalization of contraceptives has only enabled better “fertility control,” the Institute says, noting that the rate of hormonal contraceptive use among women between 20 and 44 years of age has reached 60 percent from 5% in 1970.
Eight out of ten births are well-planned.
One couple in five has a birth even calculated for the month exactly and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
Remodeling the Space Station
More than seven hours in space took astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to repair the broken solar panel, necessary for the station’s further scientific work.
It was a risky space trip that set records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned, and the amount of "spirituality" the astronauts spent on repairs.
Problems arose on Tuesday as astronauts from the Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit intended to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of landing mole for modules-laboratories.
However, they need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move the 17 and a half-ton module that produced electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to anchor at its final location.
After moving it, the crew began disassembling the module’s sixty-seven-meter solar panels.
And in that one of the panels, laying as a pulling harmonic, due to the attachment of the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
The disassembly was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to make a check-out on the Discovery, and subsequently go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was selected to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, attached to the arm of the station, and to do the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (spacewalker) of the US Aviation and Space Administration (NASA).
High, strong, very agile, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original vocational physician was commissioned to “operate” a “injured” solar panel.
After thoroughly examining the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and attached a kind of "dlahy" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by another "spacewalker" who remained near the balance chamber, and also from the inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the commander of the crew.
The tools he used, namely a mini hockey clothed with an insulator to prevent an electrical shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "written out" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely disassembled and then invented his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts returned to the Discovery spacecraft to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris stock exchange after the aviation and defense company announced it would have to spend between 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delay of the A400M.
EADS lost 4 percent and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The Financial Group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 due to delays caused by slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for launch flight.
The cost for mitigating delays in delivery of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at "1.2 billion to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European constructor EADS said.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new earnings outlook before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) next Thursday, when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS production results in 2006 fell by 86% mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380.
The group originally expected to deliver the first A400M aircraft to the French military in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday’s elections will take place without much expectation: the Russians will vote for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Reaffirming thus, after the very few free campaigns, its tendency toward stability, even toward authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will give voters a pre-titled television message on public channels, whose content is kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that appears to celebrate a overwhelming victory.
When he was receiving a foreign ambassador yesterday, the president didn’t let anything out of him and contented himself with another attack on the West accused of interference – his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we wish for fair, as transparent and open as possible elections, without the slightest defect in beauty,” he said.
This is not the case in the eyes of the opposition.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zjuganov says that "no such dirty elections have ever been held, not even under Yeltsin."
After the repression of last weekend’s demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, has a visit ban, according to his lawyer.
“Russia has a Homo Soviet mentality.”
Behind these parliamentary elections of mere tense expectation, two far more open questions are posed:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper announced the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, who was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, is unable to run for a third term in a row.
No followers appear.
What role will Putin play after March?
Will he be prime minister?
Or the leader of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful United Russia party, which will choose a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the whole line in parliamentary as well as in presidential elections.
It is tradition.
“The Russians have the mentality of homo sovietica, they don’t feel like they are masters of their fate,” says Lev Gudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg notes a more distant context in time: the civil society, in this country Christianized five centuries after Europe, has been delayed; this glorious common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, and this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by some economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today “voluntarily give up their personal responsibility” which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
“Why think?”
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) rule the local candidates of United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
The public preferred stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a fifty-four-year-old professor: "Why to think?
Those who are in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
loaded memory
After more than sixty years in the confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are being opened to the public.
47 million archival documents stored over a length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were until then accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and namely, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
In May, eleven countries, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archives to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all countries is over, the opening came into effect yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to examine “especially the movements of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, opposed the disclosure of these named documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What is the presumption of homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding the deported or forced labor of civilians subjected, bringing them evidence of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Antisemitism at Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India amounts to almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of India’s foreign trade.
The EU and India are expected to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission a green letter to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of India’s foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth trading partner of the EU.
“The free trade agreement will greatly boost both economies” and “India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner clarified.The Asian and European giant jointly exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" annually, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regreting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential." EU and India will meet at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England offered £10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England on Thursday announced its intention to alleviate current fears that credit market conditions will deteriorate again by offering £10 billion in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an exceptionally long offer.
“In an effort to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavorable at the end of the year and to give banks greater confidence in how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period that starts on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market operation,” it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that £10 billion (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6, at 12:15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Usually lasts a week.
The BOE said in a statement that it was "still ready to take further measures to keep interest rates" on interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interbank interest rate was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fees that have deterred banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the evolution of the pound against the euro, many preferred amounts placed on the financial markets by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for a Popular Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address Socialist (PS) proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss individual paragraphs of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, which equates to a rejection of the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the bill came within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which was the increase of the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of the oscillating TIPP, traffic check or rental regulation.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the session was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an occasion to exchange views, sometimes more vividly, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television appearance on purchasing power.
PS Chairman Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his club will re-submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act, which will be discussed in the House next week.
A New Festival Is Born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer announced Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Republic Festival by British organizer Melvin Ben.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” said Charlie Jones of C3 for Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from 8 to 10 August at a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, made him one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Beginning in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also been in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever experienced and says his firm and Melvina Benna’s firm are working together to give the region a festival event of European style.
“Originally, we chose Philadelphia as our marketplace, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to set up a festival in the heart of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“I talked with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in politics because of the current leadership of the city, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Grant Park, Chicago in 2005, after standing out on the festival stage in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both events take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benna festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more on green spaces in the cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a way that creates the impression of a country festival in a European and a city in a American way.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The public of Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the realization of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims "that they are profitable enough to allow investing in such an event and welcoming a festival that, hopefully, will have a long duration."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s capacity is “very high,” similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which can accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is yet to be printed.
“Vineland will be rock-like, but the music there will be varied to attract as much audience as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator itself stands against it.
This mission of persuasion is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is “politically challenging” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns “runaway productions.”
Is it hard to get the "Governor" into the cloths?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he will go there.
Our job is to offer those that they consider to be the best,” he said.
Hunting for Festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcottea’s priority is the promotion of local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, whether it’s Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s going to be about introducing Quebec films, bringing them to mind and making sure the directors provide interviews.
A few weeks ago, Dark Age had a good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be featured at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be featured in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also presented four short films and four full-length films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Will it happen at the end of the year on the stock market to the marathon? experts split 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors are already holding hands in anticipation of a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
However, experts are not sure if this will happen this year.
Bank Banif believes that "statistically the month of December has a positive course on the stock market."
However, it is inappropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, especially because, in the current context, the markets have certain doubts, at least in the short term.”
These experts do not predict that the stock exchange will boost in the last few weeks of the year, stating that “the stock market isined by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income affected by the effect of turnover to high-quality securities, both in long and short sections.”
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "mostly because the impact of a likely downturn of the Fed (Federal Reserve System) is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of incentives to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI Bank in Spain, agrees that it’s not the right time to make bold statements that there will be a marathon.
"There is not much reason to be happy," the expert assures.
Ibex lost 4 percent from its November 8 highs, when the index closed at 15,945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year slightly closer to 16,000 points due to portfolio rearrangements and the traditional retirement insurance deposits that occur every year at this time.
This expert, however, suggests that this year will be a little different, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market direction.
Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and “therefore we could observe the index’s reflection triggered by reports from the U.S. about the impact of the crisis on the credit market.”
The analyst believes that the results will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that will take care of bringing Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that “this year is a row on strong titles.”
This expert would include both major banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, “because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive.”
Inversis Banco’s Federico Olucha, on the other hand, assures that growth will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich in this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year due to increased sales during the Christmas season.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also do very well, even though they are not very represented in this field in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a month of declines only in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis triggered by a technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained back 28.17%, December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be its fifth profitable year (for now Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
The same goes for other Spanish entities, as they are the first group to decide to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of their branches until 20.30 a.m. and open on Saturdays from 10 to 20.30 a.m.
BBVA, another group that has also assured several times that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
Meanwhile, it intends to reach an agreement with trade unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, though not for the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be crucial for other entities to join or not this initiative, which promotes trading opening hours.
This is precisely the purpose of the project that the Bank Popular has set out.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, businessmen and shops from selected streets where branches will be opened.
The bank intends to open 200 of these branches across Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank is modernizing the branches it already has in the trading zones by adapting them to the profile of the clients in the individual streets.
This extension of the opening time is complemented by a different concept of branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
Commercial Director Ángel Rivera assures that this restructuring will not mean a big investment, but a greater recruitment, as it moves from six employees to eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with meeting spaces for small and medium-sized enterprises and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in Madrid’s streets of Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía and, according to Rivera, it seems to have been a lucky choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialized immigrants, which are operated under the brand Mundocredit, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivera said.
The company has agreed to sell mobile phones through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock exchange doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We have done it.”
Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the transaction when he stated that the television he runs has doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
There was only one thing that ruined his joy: 'what I regret is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,' he said.
And he stressed that because of the weak market, “we have fallen less.”
Telecinco closed trading with a 2.54 percent shift yesterday.
This gain increased their loss for the past half of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (an additional 13%) so according to Bloomberg data reaches 4.488.88 million euros.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52 percent yesterday and since January totaled by 40.5 percent, has a half-value of 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were valued is 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518,53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 offers, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do on the same market, at what price and how we evaluate it in tracking.”
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first TV channel to surpass a billion gross advertising revenues this year, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, a branch that provides the group’s advertising.
If the forecast was met, the TV channel would see a 3.6% increase in advertising revenue this year, up from 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors analysts focus on for Telecinco’s best relative development on the stock exchange is the increased pay out it has so far retained: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after acquiring 33% of Endemol jointly with his parent company Mediaset.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50 percent, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already increased Endemol’s value by 33 percent.”
According to analysts, the market is currently on the rise.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered Telecinco’s earnings forecast by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
This is due to the fact, they explain, that it stopped expected income growth from 0.5 percent to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna 3’s expected profit by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves implementation of MiFID from 1 November
Parallel to parliamentary talks, which ended today with a congressional vote on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has undergone a public hearing of the regulations developing the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of MEPs and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernization of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services companies (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities brokers and portfolio managers.
In addition, the number of systems for carrying out transactions with financial instruments is being expanded by connecting multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stock exchange brokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges companies providing investment services to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and methods of coping with risk, and requiresining a report of all operations carried out to facilitate supervision by CNMV.
During the negotiations in the Congressional Trade Commission, a number of adjustments were included, among which stands that securitised receivables should be regarded as a "complex" financial instrument given the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what happened in the U.S. with high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
Furthermore, the transposition of the Directive has been used to legalise the functions that may be held by undergraduates in the field of economics and business management 30 years after a royal decree in 1977 established the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate also included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as a broker who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide products trading and customer acquisition services for different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process used for the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, but using different methods of statistical modeling to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE) has recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore may not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will come to light on 14 December this year.
"ISC will continue to remain at a relatively high level"
Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the November increase in ISC to 4.1% was a "temporary figure", but predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in congressional columns that "even if it won't be a favourable figure," Spain's inflation differential versus the monetary union is still "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
“We expected a value of around 4 percent,” the Minister of Economy said at the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make €42 billion from Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion ($16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually decreased over the course of two and a half months due to customer distrust, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity’s name with its trading financial brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of revenues invested in British banks over the next three years in order to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
Richard Branson, a group known in the UK for its striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week marked an offer by the Virgin consortium, which comprises three other companies, like this one that will prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged corruption in construction
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of Murcia’s city of Totana (of the People’s Party) early this morning for his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices revealed this week.
A police officer and a police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May of this year Juan Morales, the current MP of the People's Republic and then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources addressed by Cadena SER, could be the "head" of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission and no further arrests are excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, the main suspect, was charged with corrupt construction practices revealed earlier this week.
As Cadena SER yesterday, the lawyer of the 'humanitarian' MP Juan Morales, who was being checked, was arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
Moreover, according to investigators, Morales is being investigated for allegedly collecting commissions for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction firm, which overqualified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono has accepted an offer to lead the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to chair Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to stand at the next general election at the head of the candidate list of the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party) in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the general election, to become chairman of the Congress.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapater, which took place today at noon in the federal headquarters of the party.
The head of the executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be a candidate of the Socialist Party to the chair of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Congress President Manuel Marin, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run for the next general election and to leave his active political career in order to engage in the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister had repeatedly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He also said that just as citizens know who will be the deputy minister of economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to "transparently" announce who will preside over Congress.
If Bono gains the post, he hopes to turn the House into “a house of respect, not of insults or screams” and to “get more and more like citizens.”
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk peacefully is Congress, the prime minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
Likewise, he pronounced praise to the current president Manuel Marin and “his good work” and did not want to imagine himself in his place so as not to reduce himself to what his opponents might consider “greatness.”
Climate propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is subject to ruthless persecution of both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, it must demonstrate strong cohesion.
And besides having a leader of the movement who is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a “new treaty with the planet”.
This proposal forces him to explain why the actions or omissions of his government have significantly contributed to Spain’s lead in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it is happening, and why its government, the government of the treaty, hasn’t prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which will be damaged by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
We have not seen such explanations, nor will we expect them.
It is necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Action against climate change, real action, is unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one centimetre of the gasoline price proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) seemed to Zapater so risky in terms of elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it costs nothing, pure propaganda, slogans lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not blame, does not demand anything, but is an ornament of mítings and arouses tenderness.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor and does not ask us to ride a bicycle and cool off with a windsurfer.
Mayor and local police chief arrested on suspicion of corruption in construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totana, the "people" Jose Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located along with a number of police officers who also appeared at the Commission for Construction and the City Enterprise for the management of industrial land and apartments.
These three arrests were added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into land suitable for construction, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 homes there.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but are charged in a short-term trial at the Totana City Court of First Instance.
The first six detainees were brought to court today.
According to sources, the investigation is being conducted against the former mayor of Totana and now a member of the autonomous parliament for the People’s Party (PP), Juan Morales.
Further, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate office registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were charged.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to that group and through which bribery was handed over.
The investigation is carried out by a crime group in the construction of the Central Operational Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, have also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Totana.
At the time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, namely, in the area a very well-known owner of a poultry meat company, who could have served as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two "spa" hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was over-qualified and its project was to double the population of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and on Fernando el Católico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s issue of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn’s book happened to appear there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public debate in connection with the tragedy at a school in the city of Jokela.
The murderer of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the council for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that the professors take a critical stance on Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in high schools.

One colleague reports on the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime at a rate from six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you sell plates at a price of less than EUR 400 in the store, this is considered a mere offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1 000 from the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for withdrawal (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal the car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for the withdrawal (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than a compact shift.
To participate in the disturbance has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts the rate would be from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious in accordance with Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than the download of a film on DVD.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic material to minors (§ 186).
So if my colleague is not wrong, someone has taken a hand, and it’s fine.

My treating doctor strikes me one of his articles on strange research titled “Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less.”
Or the feelings provoked by the monthly salary in employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the Life & Brain Institute’s Neurocognitive Imaging Group in Germany, “The greatest activation occurred when the study participant responded correctly and his colleague wrongly.”
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, activation was moderate, but when one got double, activation was higher.
I really don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the State Prosecutor’s Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her term will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are on the list, from which the title was taken by the Swiss director Marcelo Schüpbach’s documentary “Carlin’s List” (2006, not listed in Spain), which follows from Belgrade to New York the work of a Swiss prosecutor in pursuing fugitive criminals and pressuring the relevant states to tighten the network.
Which insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, represents a considerable expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of holding a driver’s license, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive an agreed insurance amount in a certain amount for taking care of paying damages in the event of an insurance event.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, status, gender, length of holding a driver’s license, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the greater the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that married people have fewer accidents than self-employed drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of rides, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
With increased frequency, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the premium price.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose such insurance that best corresponds to his profile of the insured.
We will show you the most important variable for choosing this or that type of insurance, which in addition to meeting the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five encounter various disadvantages such as low driving experience and short driving license holdings when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discounted premiums in order to obtain insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the insurance event payment that the client will provide will be predetermined when determining the premium price, which will be the higher the lower the participation would be," explains Luis Noguera, chief executive of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in traffic so that the client insures against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
The Recommendation .
If you are under twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
Malus, on the other hand, is an increase in the basic rate.
“Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” Noguera explains.
After the limit of twenty-five years, it is easier for drivers to contract insurance because the customer’s risk index is reduced, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to contract insurance against all risks with a discount.
“Young people usually can’t take advantage of previously acquired experience when an accident occurs, or even when driving,” the director of the European company in Spain assures, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the “fear of the newcomer” has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their rates will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discounted premium (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the traffic, starting the third year from the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their driving is quieter and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford the luxury to get the highest discount,” says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended insurance against all risks with a discounted premium (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would most suit us given our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point to AC Milan, which means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will match their strengths this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as for Italy it would mean being first and for Scots it would decide the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured progress in their fifth match by a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to make sure that he does not get the six-point Chess who will play with Benfica, who has four.
The two matches of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where it will first enter the thirteenth in the semi-final in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed earlier than others, and an indecisive outcome at the stadium of Giuseppe Meazzy seems most likely, even if both teams try to fight for victory because the Italians won’t want to tactize at home and Celtic knows that after winning it would be first and secure a better place in the eight-finals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could be enough to advance even a defeat if Chess won’t, but it can’t rely on it, because with the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won in the first straight match (2:0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening to the Scots, who believe they will get to the semi-finals in the reorganized Champions League for the second time just as they defeated them in the same match in the previous competition by scoring Kaká in the extension (1:0) after the status of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
To hope that the "rossoners" will win will be the Chessman, for whom it is worth winning only if Celtic lost, both for progress to the eight-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being the last and having no chance of continuing in the highest European competition, could have reached third place with one win, so it would play in UEFA.
Spice Girls' first concert in Vancouver attended by 20,000 people
The Spice Girls launched their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in the wake of their breakup in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver declared that the reunion of their band is "great".
Approximately 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which included a video depicting the history of the band, which caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
Return and the world tour take place at the same time as they release a new album released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their major hits, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets donated to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though nervous Victoria banned him from doing so a few days ago.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he'll think about the show."
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the band in 1998 "due to disputes between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness when meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
“I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world’s public opinion has changed, the view of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the reunification of the group, which she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have settled and we all love each other very much.”
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV television, the group flew to Vancouver with a special Virgin Airlines.
At the arrival, a caregiver was waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4), and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
It will be held in Madrid on December 23.
New gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
Russia and Ukraine are currently facing a dispute over the price of natural gas, increasing the risk that Russian gas supplies to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is conducted by pipeline through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two countries last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it gets from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinech told Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused Gazprom to cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a drastic decline in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-fourth of all gas supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underused.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must check out foreign employees'
The inspector said the Scottish NHS chambers must improve criminal records checks on non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report highlighted that other key checks went well on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was interested immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow airport in staff recruited from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, a twenty-eight-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after someone hit the door of the main terminal building with a jeep.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of linking to attempted bombings in the UK.
NHS chambers are expected to check foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK before hiring them.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for criminal records checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with checks in several countries.
"Al we found that some of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS is in much alignment with its own policy of pre-employment checks, but also added: “Our report highlights areas in which the system could be improved to ensure accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel is available.”
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
“The report suggests that current pre-employment checks at the Scottish NHS are working well and it’s not clear what additional value those comments will bring,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office noted that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commission had a problem identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that established control procedures at NHS authorities in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign NHS workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to handle this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
She also added that the Scottish government, in agreement with the health committees, will consider the recommendations of this report and will ensure that best practices appear in updated guidelines for pre-employment checks of all staff – including foreign ones – that it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five British Independent Film Awards, including the Best Film Award.
The awards also won star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and in the side role Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller The Scandal Notes.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety award for getting a British film to the world stage.
The prizes were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film – whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie, and New Order – cost just £3 million.
But he won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of U2’s album Joshua Tree – for best director and for best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner - as the film by Julien Temple about singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for Best Documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the prize for Best Actor for his role as the driver of the Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s London thriller East Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of hard guys, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
This fifty-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another episode of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he is proud of this award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me,” he added.
“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He’s my man, a great actor of his time, I’m very honored.”
The Independent Film Awards, known as the Bify, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 For Terrorist Plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the largest oil exporter said one of the cells wanted to paste missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda supporters have been campaigning against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A television report that an alien-led cell of eight militants planned an attack on a oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid response unit to defend facilities from al-Qaeda’s failed attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report cited an internal statement from the ministry: 18 of the arrested were members of a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” who slipped into the country.
She also said the militants planned to smash eight bullets into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees were charged with planning murders of religious and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting with allied troops and a U.S.-backed Shiite government that conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have coopted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants – supported by the calls of Al-Qaeda’s Saudi leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government – targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
“This war has been a huge effort by the security forces over the past... five months,” a spokesman for the ministry told state television.
A 16-member “media cell” in Medina was also arrested, aimed at promoting “takphirian thinking” – an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as non-believers and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
Climate on Venus may be a glimpse into the future of Earth
Scientists have announced yesterday that Venus could once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from an orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more similar to the swinging twin Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are roughly equal in size and orbiting on similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the sluggish greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower rotation rates have sent Venus on a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by storms and hurricane-powered winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has studied the planet for one year, offer a blatant glimpse of how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said: "It's becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
“Our new data allows us to compile a scenario in which Venus started just like Earth, even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago.”
Police arrest ‘enriched uranium’
Kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was arrested yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people have been arrested and the material is being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still Docked
Mitt Romney said it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer questions from Snowmen.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to a video and handed them over to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28 was as comic as a snowman asking Democrats about global warming in the opposite party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party heading for next year’s elections.
It is unclear how exactly the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This issue is one of the strongest republican topics.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the scroll when they heard something pleasant: the speaker recorded peak consensus when candidates spoke of a tough approach at the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the leading national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who moved forward in key early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shatter the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two fought fiercely when questioners asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Secondary candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on this topic.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game because they started beating the alarm about immigration sooner and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same opinion: more stringent on borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to be very annoying when other topics came up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani, through this, came to the conclusion that although the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn’t believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — who is now opposed to all assumptions at the top of a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Pressured to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to run, making him laugh.
The match remains extremely open.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise in Iowa goes hand in hand with recent money-raising achievements and Ron Paul’s loud joke during Wednesday’s debate.
The two have rebounded from the bottom, as the two wings of the party are still unable to agree on the more familiar and traditional candidates.
In the 1980s and 2000s, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with the victory report of America’s size on his lips, squeezing on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from unambiguous.
Labour Pain
Gordon Brown has again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is a common practice in British political scandals, this is not spicy.
No orders appear to have been sold, no bills in the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no out-of-marriage fingers have been blotted.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would go by without being discovered that some wealthy businessman for four years masqueraded contributions to the ruling Labour Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by surveys, there was hope to ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly funny liberal-democratic leader formulated, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unscrupulous rescue of the troubled bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
The poorly thought out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed an unimaginable administrative barrier.
Three retired generals launched a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending because they claimed that being a commander of the armed forces is part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abraham; Peter Watt, Labour’s secretary-general (and their former guard of internal discipline), has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards his end.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a point of overthrow behind which they find governance difficult.
The people don’t trust politicians and don’t like them, but they mostly remove their mistrust when a new party takes over it.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to do anything better, and may not even be in office for a long time, this shift is gone: the government becomes rotting, ministers begin to make briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one sense, Mr. Brown’s position is complicated, as he cannot take the position of a new leader compared to other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the Treasury Office records are linked to the decisions Mr. Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s troubles, such as a long investigation into political party financing caused by “value for money,” voters can safely assume he was.
Still, Mr. Brown’s trouble is not as bad as it seems.
That is not as terrible as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The recent turmoil around political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
It may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham’s action but didn’t know it was illegal, will surely be thoroughly questioned; likewise Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-gatherer, who learned about the overwhelming donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not in any way involved; there is nothing to suggest that he was aware of these tricks, even though most of the payments were made only after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half of the job.
He quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but he diluted his determination by seeking a proven tool, a commission to investigate the matter, led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not difficult.
If the law is violated, it is a matter of the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which hasn’t had one for six months, and move forward with a real reform of political party financing.
This would require Labour, who are in the narrow, to cooperate with the Conservatives and even give up their special financial relationship with the unions – bitter pills for a devout party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in polls; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to win is with unquestionable integrity and high competence.
Card Shark
Does the mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the backflies begin to stir around naturally.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is shrinking, predators have focused on the credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer loans were infected by underlying mortgages.
Signs of tension are obvious.
There is an increase in the number of cases of failure to pay (with more than 30 days of payment delay) and depreciated accounts (accounts that the provider considers non-executable).
HSBC last month losses of $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market, also due to insolvent credit card loans.
However, it is still too early to panic.
There are still very few unpaid bills and unable to pay.
According to the rating agency Moody’s, the third quarter’s insolvency rate of 3.89 percent was almost a whole percentage point below the average.
The deteriorating rates can be explained in part by technical reasons.
A change in the U.S. Personal Bankruptcy Laws of 2005 has led to a sharp decline in the number of bankruptcies, making a large part of the credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of amortizations) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders have deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good repayment rate, showing how much consumers pay off their debts per month.
And trust in securities secured by credit cards is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
There are definitely direct pathways to spread the infection between the underlying mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when real estate loans dry out, consumers are more likely to become indebted through credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, look at cash flow rather than the values of guaranteed items, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of lenders.
They can even be advantageous for lenders.
Consumers’ motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets drops below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up the list of priorities to repay.
Card issuers can also react faster and more flexibly to more tumultuous conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid changes in the prices of guaranteed items.
“It doesn’t happen that one beautiful morning we’ll just rethink all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Even though the risk of an explosion in the style of underlying mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Be careful of the backflies.
British Bankers Admit Guilt in Enron Case
Three British bankers who were supposed to be tried for their roles in a fraud linked to former financial chief Enron Andrew Fastow on Wednesday changed their testimony and admitted guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially denied guilt in seven fraud charges, in which they had joined Fastow in 2000 to participate in financial fraud -- to get rich on account of their employers.
They were due to stand in court in January.
However, during a trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been on the front page for two years, which lasted the issuance procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The charges raised against them in 2002 made Mr. Fastow aware that he was the target of the government’s investigation into Enron’s collapse.
The prosecution against the bankers -- who earned the nickname of the "NatWest Troika" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to summon the scam together with Fastow and his former chief affiliate Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron’s affiliate branch controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a bunch of enron scams that pushed Enron into a spiral of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch at zero, but our three British knew it actually had a considerable value.
The company under Kopper’s control bought the bank’s stake in this branch for $1 million.
The accused bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misleadingly informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in the Greenwich Branch of NatWest.
But those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others received approximately 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted guilt in two conspiracy cases for his role in the Enron collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
The three British were released on bail of $1 million, ordering them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country’s seventh largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks made it impossible to hide billions of debts or report failed speculations as profitable.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving more than twenty-four years in prison.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow’s powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for a nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the rich Russians, however, it is small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream spokesman.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgia of spectacular consumption at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping to attract newly wealthy Russians to everything from mahogany-loaded yachts to diamond-decorated car compartments that 50 Cent’t be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stand.
“It’s a nice car, but it’s five and ten against us,” he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
On the waves of oil, money runs into the Russian capital just as it did when it was in Dallas.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans became enormously wealthy and moved to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the 1970s Saudis and the 1990s Japanese, Russians are becoming the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part on this Klondik.
In another place in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford, and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH Group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total wealth of $282 billion.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research, the local main institute in the field, released a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-class" millionaires in Russia, whose wealth in total gives $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jewellery David Morris.
She was on the trade fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are perfectly arranged and every man is for all his wealth.”
As they walked through the halls in their evening dress on Sunday evening, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovcov, five years older, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at those cars and I can't choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who dressed in branded clothes as a veteran of the red carpets, next to which Joan Rivers looks like a home bucket.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed primarily at fresh rich, brand-driven Russian shoppers who are willing to sit down for a few hours in road traffic to walk around the warehouse that screamfully blends Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai, Gund plushes and a stream.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stall of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt’s painting from hand-painted blue stoves in survival size.
“The Russians are more interested.”
And indeed, local sellers say that the Russians with old money (according to Russian standards is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known brands of limited editions that would never appear on the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether they were millionaires, millionaire ambassadors or ordinary tourists, flooded the trade fair halls day by day.
Some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with golden threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer, said on Sunday afternoon that he had sold three car grids in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantom for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for the Russian casino owner, which had a fence coated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four such.
“The Russian millionaire who wants a wheel of pstrass skin or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconium doesn’t have to ride those wheels,” Karapetian said.
“They’ll store them in their garage for thirty to forty cars.”
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean anything very exclusive at the moment, given the great rise in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more than you think.”
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at a stand run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has erected four British-style red telephone boxes filled with a column of fake bills worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Walkers stopped to throw around a bunch of money, or to let friends take a photo of themselves on their cell phones as they rested in the midst of a replacement wealth, or simply to pull out a pocket of a couple of millions.
“You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a faulty operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out the big windows of the restaurant O’Smile Healthy and watched the ambulance come to the white new-English house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police car soon joined.
And then another.
“Then I saw the delivery of a forensic doctor arrive,” said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant inspector.
At that moment I knew someone was dead.
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant of the director of the Newark police department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked in house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Miss Arroy's death, and hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness to the leadership of the Newark police.
Miss Arroy has been an assistant to police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, stubborn and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
She was my shield.
She would protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy stated that Mrs. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Commission on Alcoholic Beverages Control, and that she left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union District Attorney Theodore J. Romankov, said detectives are trying to find out if Miss Arroy died from the consequences of an unauthorized surgery.
“It’s one of the options,” Ms. Walsh said.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house around three o’clock in the afternoon.
In November, they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh did not say whether the authorities had heard Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro’s house, with a ruined rose bush in the yard and a Dalmatian licking in the back, no one responded.
Next to the door leading to the basement, in the open garage, there was a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain bikes on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the New York Police Department, Miss Arroy provided him with invaluable help in bite with the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
“She said, ‘You should be careful about this or that,’” he said.
She was there whenever I came and she was there whenever I left.
It was embarrassing.”
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to strengthening global exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank will try to soothe lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by reassuring statements by the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second behind Ben Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman, said that in response to the continuing pressure on the financial markets, managers must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an apparent effort to calm the irritated markets amid signs of a resurgent credit burden, Mr. Kohn said the recent upswing “partially reversed some improvements in market functioning at the end of September and in October.”
He also said that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of further deterioration of the financial conditions of households and will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh donations of capital to the U.S. markets, and possibly further cuts in interest rates to stabilize credit conditions.
These notes also helped calm Wall Street amid further bad news on the U.S. economy, as apartment sales recorded record low figures in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cutting costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the unsuccessful betting on providing inferior housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to be shut down in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and closed to 13.289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index strengthened by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index boosted by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed to 6.306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions on the markets showed full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month money packages were auctioned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release over-the-counter money to London’s money markets has increased with the three-month British interbank lending rate “Libor” rising after uninterrupted growth since November 12 to its highest since the end of September – 6.59 percent.
England must choose: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
There are two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six behind England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who has to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the selection committee, who holds this post best in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, captain, with decision-making help, and because the table of Hugh Morris, chief manager of the English team, begins to fill with applications for the post of the national selection officer, though not necessarily full-time.
He who is not in the sixth place will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It’s not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets through a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, the choice is challenging and requires a judgment that must always be subjective in the end.
Is it time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to the Shah, if so?
We could ask the same in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and industry insight, should be promoted to the commission - the place is only for one.
Who can tell which level is right for a cricketer when he has no chance of falling or floating to the next level?
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In a team, the cricketer has to capture the captain’s look at the right moment if he wants to take the wicket, and the cricketer needs regular chances at starting positions if he wants to ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the selector is more complicated.
For example, last season there were a lot of better ones than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and overtaken as an artillery.
Anderson took 32 wickets in the first class with 33 overtakes on each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at an equally modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
Whether he will play at the Asgiriya Shah stadium or Bopara can be just a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or end the career of both, or it may not have a big impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class gave good performances, five wickets and 40 vacancies, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who is also, although he recorded twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia, still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, after another discussion following today’s training at the Asirgiya stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah’s greater experience to Bopar’s youthful buoyantness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha speaks his sparkling and valuable debut Test Shifts at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in the first class versus six Bopar’s, who is, at twenty-two years old, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin overheads.
However, Shah made only ten overruns in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home field in Middlesex, along with the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan wanted to re-occupy him for the next match, his launching seems to have taken some of the momentum that was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex universe has a joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket pitch and his behavior outside the pitch symbolizes the recently overturned car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the automotive sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He ran out with slight injuries and apparently a shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his fellow player watching it from a distance, to ask him excitedly, “Have you seen it?”
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed slide overhangs on the local fields, which he seems to suit, distributes effectively and fires confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Per that is the art of choice.
Personally, I’m inclined to give Bopara a chance now, but I don’t want to say that Shah won’t excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it’s him who will play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, sending out refugees who had lost their money or had expired their visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy with a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Kubajsi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspapers, because of what happened in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
“They say that Mahdi’s army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to cease fighting.
Kashim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amarya, has returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amarya called him and told him that the local rebels with the support of the U.S. military had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, urging him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is a leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribes who have been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"A few friends called me yesterday and told me that he was launching a militia against al-Qaeda in the Sheikh, and that he needed the support of me and my boys.
That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have talked about the appeal of the calm in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local “groups of prejudiced citizens” who, with guns in hand alongside the U.S. military, defend their neighborhoods.
But more was said to have been driven back by visa obstruction and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a fifty-one-year-old father of three children, voiced the suspicion shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on visas for refugees, forcing them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to return to Iraq," the Sunni retired man said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left.”
A partial reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunni were pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will once again stir up sectarian tensions and lead to further struggles.
Small Sartre, Good Education
The smallest federal state of Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, even exceling in the international focus of its universities.
In one area alone, Saarland is concerned about the same shortage of education as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who is not from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftyth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sarian education system, which is ranked fifth in the monitoring of education at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a fairly high percentage of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
Indeed, the above-average number of Sarian children are admitted to university – many of them even without studying in high school.
"The professional education system is being used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at IW.
With more than one in five youths entitled to study in a professional school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland has a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
Opportunities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Sarian Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotion campaign for engineering disciplines.
“After the first Pisa study, we have carried out a number of reforms in general education schools,” said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as early as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal states take on as well.
Whether the results of the students are significantly improved will be shown by future comparison studies.
In the 2003 PISA study, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
They know how to count better.
And to Saras’ disappointment, Pisa studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages – otherwise Saras could score in this area.
The language of the neighbors is obligatory in the schools - even if the inhabitants of Saras are not French.
Chávez moves clocks
It will be different in Venezuela than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will let the clock in this South American country go half an hour back.
In Spain, Chávez has become a ridiculous figure.
The official Venezuelan newspaper that according to the new law, the clock will be shifted by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, explained his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States has forced the world to divide time zones for hours.
On Wednesday, Chávez announced that he was breaking ties with neighboring Colombia over the hostage case.
This leftist nationalist has declared that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
“I can’t do it anymore because of my self-esteem,” Chávez said, advocating a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must vote on Sunday.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia on the release of the hostages.
Uribe spit Venezuela in the face with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Everyone is talking about Chávez.
A new mobile ringtone here sparked a riot: "Por qué no te callas" (Why are you no longer silent?) - this is the phrase that has already been downloaded from the internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by the Spanish King Juan Carlos, whom at the recent Ibero-American summit the loud remarks of this leftist populist angered so much that he silenced him in this way.
German workers face lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, German workers are threatened to reduce their real wages this year despite strong economic conditions.
Experts justify their pessimistic forecasts for a number of reasons.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees can expect a lower salary in 2007 than they did last year.
“The blame lies in the slight increase in wages, the increase in value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) told Bild.
Employees may also be faced with unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment benefits to 3.3% for the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again fall into such difficulties that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspaper quoted the social-democratic politician.
On Tuesday, it was that the explosion in food and oil prices drove inflation to its highest level in thirteen years.
In annual comparison, prices increased by 3 percent.
Venus is Earth’s twin.
Despite its life-hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought.The European spacecraft Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomena that appear on Earth in the winter: lightning in the atmosphere and winds on the poles.
For three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is flashing.
Now the European Venus Express spacecraft has brought evidence – it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the formation of primordial matter, life could have arisen on Earth thanks to lightning. storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
"If life ever existed there, it must have been a very long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere on Venus is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 degrees Celsius.
“Venus may be a hellish twin of Earth, but it’s a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve completely differently, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
Since no spacecraft has been sent exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to the scientists, the latest results of the research, which came in several articles in the journal Nature, not only emphasized the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
“They also showed that our neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than previously thought,” Esa said.
In addition to the already known windstorms on the North Pole, scientists have found a cloudy windstorm on the South Pole that rotates much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the Earth’s northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 km.
This planet, known as the Dawn or Evening, orbits the Sun in about 225 days.
A day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Despite the fact that Venus has a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, it does not resemble Earth, scientists believe that the two planets were formed under very similar conditions.
But on Earth, it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it evaporated into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler advocates Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is demanding an end to party disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama as Chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the chancellor after a joint meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls on the big coalition to end the dispute over the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
He also expressed his understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to receive the Dalai Lama in September.
“Al I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me,” Köhler said.
The federal president stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but that didn’t stop him from standing up to Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
“The Federal Chancellor has not given up on the traditional policy of united China.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the reception of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, of the coalition’s “predictive” foreign policy.
After the acceptance of the Dalai Lama as Chancellor, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government canceled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China will not endorse when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed the position of China.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions, which are also in China, is trying to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burned cars.Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that erupted in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow into violence on the streets.
The barricades were burning, the gunmen fired gunshots at the police.After severe youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is concerned about similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful not to create such a social tension that it breaks out in violence.
We have to take it seriously,” he said in the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to solve the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, we are seeing the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In the past nights, youths and police were waging harsh street battles in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings burned in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts of the German government was demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a “imitating effect”.
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from immigrant families, the unemployment rate is “over-average”.
First and foremost, more study opportunities should be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to give young people hope.”
The head of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike in France, there is a greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
He said, “H, we have to be careful.”
We need to “allow young people to work and learn quickly.”
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorities three arrests and several burned garbage baskets and cars.
Approximately 1,000 law enforcement forces have been deployed since yesterday.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The next night, the riots hit Toulouse.
The unrest was triggered by a car accident on Sunday in which two young people died.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of minors.
In the Empire of Angels "The Clouds"
The Chancellor’s distant outcome to reality documents that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it itself.
In what country does the Chancellor live?
After her relentless, indifferent-sounding and content-poor appearance at the General Debate of the Bundestag, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should ultimately govern.
To the grievance that she is focusing too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded once with a very arrogant phrase.
That’s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the Federal Assembly, she clearly demonstrated to everyone how much regret she deserves.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a sense of concern for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela “Cloud” presented herself: a politician who stands out above others, who fled to foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: he continues to praise the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets should be achieved in Germany.
And in general, such an samochvála - so much indiscretion would have been forgiven by the CDU chairman two years ago.
Now she is restricted to plain phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, he damages his image of a pragmatist who does not need to laugh because he solves problems.
But in the Empire of the Angels “Clouds” internal political problems are a marginal matter.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
There are a few secondary sentences on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel overrides when it comes to child allowances.
Three times Merkel must start from the beginning in order to be able to pronounce at least partly the correct sentence.
As soon as things start to be too concrete, they climb like in a completely foreign terrain.
Division Attack
The Republican presidential candidate debate on YouTube, in the case of favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitte Romney, has sparked a sharp debate - and both now have to worry about an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first topic.
Mitt Romney tells his rival Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp grievances: "I think his own house was just one such shelter," he replies, prejudicing the former Massachusetts governor that he had privately employed immigrants without papers.
Since the Republican base has no clear favourite yet, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos, filmed by Internet users and sent through YouTube, serve only as such help on a key topic.
“It’s precisely this policy of isolationism that allowed Hitler to take power,” McCain told his rival, Ron Paul, who is the only one to push for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain doesn’t spare his grievances on Romney for refusing to condemn the tormenting method of interrogation called “Waterboarding,” which simulates heating.
Public reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important themes of the campaign.
The public applauds whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
This will reveal the weaknesses of the two players.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explained, asking the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for advocating abortion in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in a civilian state
The day after his resignation from the post of chief commander of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Parviz Musharraf has sworn in on Thursday and will serve as president for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcasted a ceremony held in the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to work for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as chief commander of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyanim, thus subjecting himself to international pressure, from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, a former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
Withdrawing from the position of chief commander of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
Prosecutor-in-Chief Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would lift the state of emergency shortly after his oath, fulfilling other Western demands.
The country’s Supreme Court, which occupied Musharraf with his favourite lawyers after the declaration of the state of emergency in early November, in the past week rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the attack on a military convoy in the tribal region of North Vaziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
A military spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
Fathers of Krautrock Returns
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again.Three members of the group Harmonia took back their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a remake of the band’s most successful period.
They were well known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three sitting gentlemen, who at first look like they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and mainly buttons.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
Behind him is the 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
Seventy-three-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentratedly slides over the synthesizers, is from the viewpoint of the audience to the right.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, without any doubt, it will become a traditional song.
It doesn’t seem to bother the musicians.
Among the lovers of krautrock, the revival of the band Harmonia caused a considerable upset.
Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective consciousness of pop, but it is definitely not so flawed that this band is painfully missed for twenty-three years.
But why can’t even the German celebrate their still-living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, is valued more in England and America than in their own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for Lifetime Work, the hall was filled with the questioning views of German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu in their speech, the audience’s amazement no longer knew boundaries.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band Harmonia unnecessarily overloads the memory, this trio existed for only two years and at that time did not have such an influence as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
They originally performed in the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramofon company run by the Church.
Rother briefly worked for the Kraftwerk group, but gained a reputation as a guitarist for the Neu!, which at that time was the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to work as a babysitter.
It was rather life in such a spitzwegovic artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the singing choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose emblem was allegedly found in a garbage house.
Much of this harmony has been preserved.
The first album was titled "Music from Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting roses did not serve only self-awareness.
Now released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been cut off at a concert in Griessem in front of a record small, barely fifty-member scene.
Rothera then expressed a wish for the members of Harmony to hide and occasionally exercise.
For Roedlia and Moebia, this was a completely disgraceful requirement.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and insured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
For the live album from Griessemer, we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording firm, Grönland, had the goal of caring for Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The performance at the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
The British will be present, Julian Cope, an old puncher and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Love Parade founder Dr. Motte is also present.
Thus, we outlined the overall breadth of the impact of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Ene’s phrase, accompanied by the most strange sounds, floats in the hall: “Unique true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are pictures of the producer with Harmony in a peasant seat.
To create the legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photographs, on which the set of instruments are wildly connected cables.
Previously, the three veterans were once again employed by improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to organs and drums to remove those never-before-heard self-made tones from the instruments.
Electronic music is like electronic music.
Three technicians in the field.
The House of World Cultures does not change this.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, under the sound clouds she whispers, and in one beautiful place she emphasically sings "Aaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
Rather than in blues, we would find roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who cries "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not even now be let out of rest.
Even the most obvious things are thought out thoroughly on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question will either prepare a person for nerves or allow him to experience passing moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical.
With the introduction of the films The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convincing.
The subjects of the films either put too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
In The Hunting Party, there is no such actor as Richard Gere.
The good news first: War criminals Karadžić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the dark backdrop of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost this most beautiful man of the eighties from the eye, not only because he played in many pleasant, unserious roles in cool female films, but in conjunction with his press conferences eternally on the theme of Buddhism, one will take the appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes a prey (Why must movie titles be so long and confusing nowadays?).
His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is essentially what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who, although his best years have long been behind, still retains a certain remarkable charm like a ruins-like monument.
But despite this trumpet, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also comes into theaters this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the Balkan war.
With Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is praiseworthy that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this televised shallow film too soon turns into shooting and action.
The film will be similar to the Cobra 11 series, without a highway, but with war.
In the film The Hunting Party, you can explore why the Balkan War hasn’t been a really good film so far.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who marry the “Lish,” a Serbian top war criminal, could in a different time and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (here is both Richard Shepard) become a new “Apokalypse.”
Both stories are surprisingly similar: a small group goes to the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the wretched and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can finally be written off after reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film do what NATO, the CIA and all the criminal hunters in the world have failed in the last five years: catch the criminal and leave it to the just revenge of Bosnian Muslims.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth it to turn to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a profound human message.
It condemns that Karadzic and Mladić are still free, and suspects Americans and French (here they are exceptionally united) that they are not engaged in persecution intensely enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women think of the famous poetry of Brecht.
In it, it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer’s desk: “I compassionately look at the inflated veins on my forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil.”
In films like The Hunting Party, there are exactly such head-to-head performances, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This issue is not limited to the issue of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was written in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
One thing to add is that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always: When a star rolls through a crisis area or walks through a mine field, films like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Frontier of the Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio are created.
Per all these conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust – Schindler’s List.
A lot of the film has apparently matured - films that are now considered to be classical Vietnamese works - "The Hunter of Eagles", "The Apocalypse" or "The Lead Jacket" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Screenwriters do not have the skills needed to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Per he has to form a sarcastically measured artistic outlook like novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel “Lempierre’s Dictionary” and “The Balkan War”, he stated: “The only likeness is that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in terrible ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust criticizes abandonment of the Olympics
The resignation of the mayor from hosting the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has encountered sharp criticism from politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in estimating chances.
Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz called the decision "unfortunate from a business point of view."
No other project in recent years has aroused in the city as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not have been possible to maintain this sports and political enthusiasm at such a high level."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a modified timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his earlier statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic until 2028.
“Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic candidacy,” von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
At the beginning of December, the Sports Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
“This preference for us means that with a timetable for 2028 we have no realistic chances.”
Nevertheless, this dream has not yet ended, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust’s remarks regrettable.
Hamburg will not host the next 25 years of the Olympics.
“It’s too early to destroy this chance by calling plans buried at this early stage,” said HSB President Günter Ploss.
To renounce the candidacy would be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate, which he delivered at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Sports Union.
Von Beust did not announce the candidacy of Hamburg for the 2015 Universiade as a substitute for hosting the Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association of Hamburg just nominated the candidate city last week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate has blamed it for wasting precious time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on the organization of the Olympics and excluded the construction of apartments," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region still planned the Olympics with the entire area later being used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympics took place in Hamburg.
Hamburg crashed in Leipzig.
This is not Warhol’s box.
Whoever combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or yes ?
The wooden boxes currently manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows on the list of Warhol’s works.
Most of his listed ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeit.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo boxes", an internal research by the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; the six "Brillo boxes" that in 1995 were donated to the Museum Moderna Museet by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most of the other "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type that are in circulation on the international art market.
The preceding events are a messy, confusing chain of artistic and curator events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes, which were based on the red-and-white design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
The exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's permission - hundreds of Brillo carton boxes. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their subjects, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to manufacture several wooden Brillo bins in Sweden, but these are not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time now talk about fifteen boxes that rightly entered the history of art and auction as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred bits were manufactured and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén barrels were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
At that time, Warhol was three years after his death.
Lars Byström, chief conservationist at Moderna Museet, explored, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968, and after their plywood plates were painted with the basic color and brown, they were painted with oil-white by the brush.
On the contrary, from the structure of copies from 1990 it turned out that the paint was applied directly to the cartridge plate by a painting roll without the prior basic coating - in addition, it is an acrylic paint and not an oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo box list," said Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies."
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these “main charges” raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
Until now, the organization has remained silent.
Rebels in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel troops forcibly fortified in a hotel in Manila and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for election manipulation and corruption, told reporters at the hotel that he denies responsibility for the bloodshed.
Previously, soldiers devoted to the government attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were brought to trial for a failed 2003 coup attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his approximately 30 supporters.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Government-loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The President has convened an emergency meeting of the Security Council.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the attack.
“People have had enough of it,” Triallnes said.
“We encourage people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other military units will join the march in the near future.
Critics of the government have called for large protests against the president on Friday.
The government has been accused of corruption for months.
The financial district of Manila has already become the main scene of a revolt of about 200 soldiers against Arroy in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the uprising crashed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versailles
United Internet owns more than 20% of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company on Wednesday that the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.5% of the share capital.
There has been speculation about the acquisition.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its share in Versailles.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After the bank Berenberg increased its stake in the company of this network operator in Düsseldorf by another 5% to 15.1%, claims of accession appeared on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this money institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a 10% stake in Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put another 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros on sale.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a spokesman for United Internet explained.
In order to acquire competing Freenet, the companies jointly established a joint venture for SMEs.
On Thursday, United Internet announced that the two companies would satisfy themselves with more than a 10% stake in Freenet for now and would not use their right to take over another 18.49% of the enterprise.
It is considered that companies remain open to all options, in particular the possibility of further increasing their share in Freenet AG.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
This months-long and hardly transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische so far held a 6,01% stake in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will get approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of Vatas was agreed in August.
