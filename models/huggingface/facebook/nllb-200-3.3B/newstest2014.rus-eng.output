In Kineshme and the district , two men committed suicide
One of the hanged had previously attempted suicide.
On October 30, at about 1:00, in the village of Lugovye, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he has previously attempted suicide.
What drove the man to such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11:50 a.m., a 41-year-old man from Kineshma committed suicide by hanging himself.
No signs of violent death were found, according to the press-service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky".
You have a black box in your car?
As American road planners struggle to find the money to fix the crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and relay that information to officials, are at the center of a controversial effort to modernize the outdated highway funding system of America by Washington and state planning agencies.
The usually boring arena of highway planning suddenly gave rise to intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use little boxes to track how many miles you've driven and maybe even where you've driven them - and then use that information in tax returns.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues regarding privacy.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states aren't waiting.
They're thinking about how, over the next decade, we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have satellite tracking capabilities.
It's really necessary for our country.
"This is not an issue we can have a choice on", said Hassan Ihrat, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is planning to start tracking the miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology for that already exists.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funding from the Government Highway Fund, which is funded by taxes Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars are doing more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn't been raised in 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax even one cent with gasoline prices so high.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable", said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on cars to test its underpayment system.
"It's the best alternative in the long run", he said.
The Zunads call it a missed user fee.
It's no wonder that this idea appeals to urban liberals, because taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California's planning authorities are looking at this system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious global warming laws.
However, Representative Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free marketers at the Reason foundation are also excited about making drivers pay per mile.
"This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole", said Adrian Moore, Reason's vice president of policy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who in 2011 urged Congress to move toward the wrong payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel many miles to get to work or the city in their daily lives.
A few states and cities, however, are going their own way.
The most enthusiastic response is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are being recruited to take part in the largest trial in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for mileage instead of gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project is already complete.
New York is looking into it.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation departments in 17 east coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is looking at how they can make this change.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteer vehicles were recently fitted with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government might be tracking their every move.
"The concern about 'big brother' and things like that is a big problem", said Alauddin Khan, chief of strategy and efficiency management for the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
As the trials were underway, the Nevada chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of individual citizens' daily movements.
Nevada is one of several states that is working hard to find a low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of driving miles without any information about time or location.
If you can do that, the Khan said, the society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small startup in California called True Mileage.
Originally, this company was not engaged in the collection of state taxes.
It was looking to enter the emerging market for a form of auto insurance where drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices she's testing are attracting road designers because they don't use GPS and they provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded by a modem.
"People are more likely to do this if you don't track their speed and you don't track their location", said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilots.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can opt out altogether, choosing instead to pay a flat rate based on the average number of miles driven by all residents of the state.
Elsewhere, they're hoping to sell the idea to a wary public by making the devices do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxing device that would also accept payment from parking meters, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be attracted to the benefits they will be offered", says the city's planning document.
Some transportation designers, however, are wondering if all this talk about wrongful payment is just a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, officials at the city's transportation commission say that Congress could very easily have overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take an aspirin", said Randy Rentchler, the commission's director of legislative and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a backup plan to provide Ukraine with gas, and to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
The IMF is in talks with the IMF about a standby loan, and another EU official directly involved in the talks added that they aim to have an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing disagreements over funding terms.
The international rating agency S&P, which on Friday downgraded Ukraine's sovereign rating by one notch to "B-" from "B", also does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to receive aid.
However, EU officials say the IMF may be able to show flexibility in its lending terms, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the financial support plan, the EU has a backup plan for supplying Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which now comes from Russia.
It could be gas from Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, officials say, is the most feasible and acceptable way if Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supply to other regions.
"EU countries and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but by other routes", the source added.
Russia out of the fight for polluting cities with cars
Attempts to solve the transportation problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world's megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about rebuilding and expanding the highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The well-known example of Singapore is that it has a strict quota for the increase in the number of private cars, and the right to buy them is bought at auctions.
It can cost two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee to enter the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only vehicles with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuel or electric cars) are allowed to enter.
Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012 with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau's Transport Pollution Control Division, Li Kunsheng, told Kommersant, the five-year plan's main goal is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (currently 5.2 million), and increase fuel consumption by no more than 5% per vehicle.
According to the agency, Beijing's motor vehicles are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program - the restriction of the use of automobile transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
The urban measures of the "green five-year plan" include, among other things, the accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, the restriction of cars entering the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs, the replacement of old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include the ban on all private cars within the fifth transport ring (there are six in the capital of China) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle number plate), as well as the issuance of registration marks for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of permits for the registration of private cars in Beijing amounted to only one third of the number in 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011, "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, automobile emissions are ten times those of industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg, nine times.
In Russia, they are only just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car trips are obviously unpopular, and can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem arises, connected with the structure of its car park, where there are two clusters weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, whose total number is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of the car park of Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM Center in St. Petersburg produced a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between housing, road surface and the amount of motor vehicles.
The researchers' main findings: the city center is provided with roads twice as short as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storage, not to expand, but to shorten the driving part (so that the streets become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the protection zone of the historic center (the total area of about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trading in Vologda will increase several-fold
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines will help to bring order to Vologda and free the streets from tenting and loafing.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell are often not subject to proper sanitation.
And that means that the health of the people of Vologda is in danger.
So, the lower limit of fines for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, according to the press service of the Administration of Vologda.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
These are primarily the crisis of non-payment of consumer loans and the mass layoffs.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been driven by consumption, which has hardly slowed down", said Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia, Clemens Graffe, presenting the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
At 6% inflation, it will be able to meet future consumer demand at about its current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But Russian companies are losing profitability, so they're probably going to be optimizing their personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, explained Mr. Graf.
Companies faced a decline in profitability.
If it doesn't, it could lead to layoffs and unemployment.
Russian business cannot afford not to raise salaries, comments Vladimir Pantyushyn, chief economist for Russia and the CIS at Barclays Capital.
Unemployment is near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
To attract or retain employees, employers are forced to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is also being supported by very rapid growth in consumer credit.
According to Mr Graf, the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans do not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth in consumer credit, money is not distributed in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments", said the economist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs is expecting more delinquencies on its unsecured loans.
They're mostly taken by the poor, the ones who don't have anything to put up.
Interest rates on these loans are high.
As a result, they are often not returned", Mr Graffe said.
So the second threat to Russia's economic growth is a possible credit crunch.
The director of the Banking Institute of the Higher School of Economics, Vasily Solodkov, is already seeing signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, lacking access to cheap resources like state banks, were forced to raise funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went to war and started to lower interest rates, the economist continues.
Small credit unions can't lend at the same interest rate, or they'll have a negative margin.
If the state banks do not abandon dumping, Russia is threatened with a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The economic expert believes that the loss of the licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks is a harbinger of a mass collapse.
"Government banks alone will not be able to cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis", warns the head of the institute.
But consumption growth will slow down without the default crisis, the investment bank believes, because of the refusal to index civil servants and military salaries, laid out in the current draft budget.
The consumption shock will be partially mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, by lower inflation).
But only in part: if investment does not increase (and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushyn of Barclays Capital does not see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios yet.
"The main risk is the continued fall in oil prices", he says.
He estimates that Russia's economy will begin to shrink if oil prices fall below $90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
The paradox is that inflation has fallen and banks have raised rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting", said Clemens Graf.
The central bank's interest rate policy does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, this is the end of all hope", said Clemens Graffe.
The money raised at the Central Bank auctions is used by banks to manage their liquidity, not to lend to the economy.
As soon as the rate is reduced, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later the central bank will realize that this strategy is not working", Mr. Graf said, and recalled that the government plans to put the ruble into free float by the end of 2015.
But we will have to either do it earlier or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
He estimates that the ruble is now artificially inflated by 10%.
"There is only one way to go", concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank casts even a shadow of doubt on the financial community that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it could bring the ruble down much more.
The II Congress of the peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is timed to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The work of the Congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national-cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities - in total about 350 people.
The forum is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or disagreements.
We live in full mutual understanding", - says Feofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were discussed, including the upbringing of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
The congress adopted a resolution.
The unofficial part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
Here was opened the exhibition of national-cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany on matters pertaining to U.S. intelligence.
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of U.S. intelligence, has said that he is willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, cannot answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strebele met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, on Thursday to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection".
But it's not a crime to tell the truth.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible".
Relations between the US and Germany have become strained following allegations that the NSA has been tapping the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing intelligence, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting him in danger and without destroying relations with the US completely", it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strobel said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "harsh and persistent" campaign of harassment that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to his political statements.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level officials - including in the United States - have found it socially useful to expose the rampant surveillance system.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for bringing hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said they'd charge $25 if the fare is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers pay only when they're at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers take care of paying in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it", she said.
Airlines began charging for first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees stuff as much as they can into the hand luggage that is stored in the upper luggage compartments, often leaving them empty.
Charges are one way to make passengers carry less.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't really about making money.
The fact is, Frontier's most loyal customers say it's getting harder to find a seat in the upper trunk.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the Frontier check-in line can get a free bag, while the next passenger in the line can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change in procedures on Frontier's website and check-in desks is designed to ensure that passengers are aware of the charge before they reach the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee won't start until the summer, though a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and that passengers who need the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern the charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand baggage fee three years ago, and another discount Allegiant Air later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage drive was bringing Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew on a Spirit flight and wondered what he would find at the gate when passengers encountered the unusual Spirit handbag collection.
"The boarding process was the smoothest I've seen in my career in the airlines", he said.
I expected to see a grinding of teeth and a fight at the landing.
The plane was full, he said, and the landing was fast.
Frontier also follows Spirit's lead on the $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive a soda or juice can keep the entire can and that a coffee refill will be provided free of charge.
She'll still give out free water.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008, but abandoned it seven months later after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed its lead.
Frontier's initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest move to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers such as Orbitz between $10 and $25 for every ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than going to an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further than anyone else in this area.
In September, it began giving twice the frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut her mileage premium to 25 percent of her mileage.
So, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier purchased from an online travel agency would get you 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a seat in advance if they buy tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue was down 9 percent, and flight capacity was down nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
The NSA blames an "internal error" and not the hackers for the shutdown
The shrouded in secrecy National Security Agency said Friday night that the shutdown of their website for several hours was caused by a technical malfunction, not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update", the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack are not true.
Earlier tonight, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA website was down for at least six hours, and the site remains inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network "was not hacked".
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online hacker activist group has claimed responsibility for taking down the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the targeted website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site goes down.
The hackers' tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly top-secret NSA, once dubbed "No Such Agency", has been in the spotlight and under fire in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive foreign and domestic surveillance programs -- all in reaction to top-secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disgruntled former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has led to speculation that today's incident was the result of a deliberate act of hacking.
Bombardier's profits are falling with the drop in deliveries and orders for planes.
Bombardier, the Canadian manufacturer of airplanes and trains, reported a 15 percent net profit decline on Thursday, driven by lower orders and deliveries of airplanes in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not released any flight test data for its newest CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information on whether its ambitious plans to bring the aircraft into commercial operation by next September will be met.
Since the first test flight of the aircraft about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions about whether the test phase is on schedule.
The results were not what the forecasts predicted and led to a drop of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from above-market to mid-market on Thursday, believing that equity growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the profit figures for the transport department", said Doerksen in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we anticipate that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family will allow it to gain a foothold in the lower-priced segment of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, firm orders for the CSeries are not yet too high, as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to verify the company's claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economics of the new liner.
There are 403 orders and agreements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the program is moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected", Boduan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the plane's downtime.
All manufacturers plan their tests differently.
We decided to hold the first flight and take a break for updates, which we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks, with all the others to follow shortly, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the operational timing and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015", Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same at 9 cents.
Gross revenue declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents a share and a gross profit of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace department's order book was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of incoming orders and general market conditions were a disadvantage", said Baudouin.
Gross revenue from the aerospace segment fell 13 percent to $2 billion .
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross revenue in this sector increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order book in the transportation unit stood at $32.6 billion as of September 30, slightly above the December 31 figure.
The revenue of the transportation division was negatively affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares in Bombardier, which also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichett will join its board, fell 8.5 percent to S$4.83 in mid-Thursday trading.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony Corporation, which ended the quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, has cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more disappointing than expected, due to a drop in demand for TVs, cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's TV business, which brought the company its first operating profit in three years in the second quarter of the year at ¥5.2 billion, fell again to ¥9.3 billion in operating loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through a difficult time, especially due to the decline in demand for TVs.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of this difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here the company's sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to have a net operating profit of ¥179 billion, up from ¥230 billion previously expected.
According to Thomson Reuters, analysts had expected the figure to be much higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to recover from the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In mid-July, a Japanese company announced the launch of a smartwatch with a number of fashionable features that will make it possible to eliminate the need to take out your smartphone 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and revenue forecast, the company's shares dropped more than 11% to a low of 1668 yen per share at the Tokyo morning open.
The speech gene was found to stimulate synaptic formation.
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that makes the "speech gene" Foxp2 function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and a summary of the study can be found on the journal's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 when a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other was discovered.
The researchers found that the family members had a faulty Foxp2 gene, but the exact way it works was unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that Foxp2 performs at least part of its function as a stimulator of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with speech formation.
It does this because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by searching for factors that stimulate synapse formation.
SXRP2 was one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 is the only one that is activated.
That SRPX2 does indeed affect vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in an experiment on mice.
When the gene activity was artificially reduced in animals, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds it made was restored.
Earlier, a link to the vocalization of Foxp2 itself was also shown in mice.
The animals injected with the human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
However, scientists still do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled by it is associated with purely "mechanical" properties of sound production or more subtle processes.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a crime boss about police investigation jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta was passing information to the criminal authority, Neel Scarborough.
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A high-profile lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was sent to prison for three years.
Basharat Dittha, 42, was handing criminal authority Neil Scarborough classified information about his drug trafficking investigation after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and known to criminals as "the tough lawyer", was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police sting operation on Scarborough, whom he had represented earlier in a drug-related trial.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three packets of cocaine at the home of a solicitor in Blackburn, Lancashire, while the solicitor was at a bar association dinner with his colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditt had been a "regular Class A drug user" after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
For eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance as part of a wider investigation into the activities of a criminal organisation involved in heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditta was passing information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today at Liverpool Crown Court, Ditta, who works for Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, was shamed after pleading guilty to two counts of obstructing justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to cocaine possession in one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer's exposure came after police investigating Scarborough's activities found that he had been regularly talking to Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him walking to Deet's house in Blackburn and putting drugs in a black golf glove with a 60% purity underneath the lawyer's trash cans.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough was repeatedly called by Ditto, who was at a dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer came home for the drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditt was a regular user of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards.
Ditt was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted "advocating secrecy".
During his detention, Ditt took out his wallet and tried to pull out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken from him.
When questioned by the police, he said that in addition to his workplace, he had a home office, and clients came to his home for legal matters.
But the court has learned that after major arrests, he called major drug traffickers, some of whom he had represented in court, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be broken, it is a criminal lawyer".
Mr. Ditt has been accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly be legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
But this is far beyond the normal attorney-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, he disgraced it.
He's been getting too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and has let his disinterestedness be questioned.
Ditta denied the charge and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately".
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditt turned from a criminal defence lawyer into a criminal offender once he started buying drugs from organised crime".
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the aims of the gang's top members, who assigned him to extract valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire public trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover it with his profession.
Mr. Deet's case was investigated by the Lancashire Serious Crime Unit, who had already secured three convictions for cocaine possession, and now another for obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to fair punishment for the perpetrators.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Sam Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the scheme were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug-related offences.
On his website, Ditta hosted a Q&A where he talks about his dream job  being a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his perfect dinner companion  Muhammad Ali, and motivation at work  being inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, said the police officers who attended the meeting of the RFS CCD.
The ticket program is overpriced, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with "Spartak" only a thousand stewards were involved, with the regulation norm of nine thousand.
Spartakov fans were entitled to 2200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This was announced by the head of the KDK, Arthur Grigoryants.
The Americans were eavesdropping on Japanese high-level officials .
On Friday, November 1, a US intelligence official, who declined to be named, said that the United States had been eavesdropping on the phone calls of senior Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several listening points in the Land of the Rising Sun.
He noted that the US, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during World War II, when the two countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, despite its postwar alliance with the Americans, is a target for intelligence, NHK reported.
Officially, neither side has commented on this information yet.
As you may recall, news of the US intelligence agency's surveillance of the German Chancellor surfaced last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to tap Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself reportedly took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, which in her opinion are the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of the government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden has said he's ready to share the details of Angela Merkel's wiretapping with the German prosecutor's office.
The German had flown to Moscow to meet a former CIA operative.
The region may put grain on the auction not before the beginning of 2014
The state procurement intervention in the region may not put grain on the market before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of agriculture of the Republic of Nikolay Kovalenko.
At present, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the market is high, there's a demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year", he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year the sown area of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550 thousand hectares were planted for the 2014 harvest (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area under the wheat and triticale harvest has been increased, rye has remained at the same level.
There's no "Brotherhood" in the M.I.D. database, which Leps was assigned to in the U.S.
The Russian security services database does not list the Brotherhood group, to which Washington has assigned singer Grigory Leps.
As noted by "Interfax" in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported that the US Ministry of Finance had included Grigory Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle", all databases were checked, but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, according to the security agencies.
"Even the name itself, 'The Brotherhood', has a certain element of mystery, a hint of a secret lodge.
"It's all very similar to a PR campaign", said an interlocutor of the agency.
The US Treasury Department announced on October 31 that it had placed on its watch lists three people suspected of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherhood" - Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsweridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Shlykov.
The individuals on this list are suspected of having ties to Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered to be influential members of criminal groups and have been on US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
The production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "ridiculous".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama designated the Brotherhood as a "significant transnational organized crime group" and ordered the Treasury to "undermine and disrupt their global criminal operations".
Blacklisting of a person by the US Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the US and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons residing in the States.
The video of the scandal has reached the police
Toronto boss Rob Ford, known for his outrageous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
The police of the Canadian city said they had the video and were ready to investigate the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
The information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use has appeared on the Toronto Police website.
Local law enforcement chief Bill Blair held a press conference to discuss the situation.
The sheriff said he wasn't authorized to share the footage with the public, but he did vouch for its existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during a drug raid by the law enforcement agency in the summer of 2013.
The existence of this video was previously reported by the Canadian press, but until recently, there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself has not commented on the matter.
He's just saying he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to resign.
The video footage found by police is one of the pieces of evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of dealing in illegal drugs, extortion, illegal profiteering and criminal conspiracy.
Lisi was the driver for Rob Ford.
The people of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken state, allowed himself to make racist and sexist statements.
Rostoaeroinvest OJSC has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the object's general designer.
The amount of the contract in "Rostovaeroinvest" is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state expertise in the spring of 2014.
The winner will design the new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of the airport complex.
The first phase of construction will cover an area of 50,000 m2, and the terminal's interior will be expanded.
According to "Rostovaeroinvest", the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time of the tender, the architectural concept of the South Airport complex, developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been determined.
The project of the main terminal building embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in implementing large projects, the company designed the C and E terminals of the Sheremetyevo International Airport and the new airport terminal complex at the Knevichy International Airport in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex "South" will be built in the Aksai district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the urban development.
The start of construction of the airport terminal complex is scheduled for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - for 2017.
Turkish politician goes on hunger strike against wall on Syrian border
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of a separation wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
The local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, on the border with Syria, Ayşe Gekhan, has declared a hunger strike in protest against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the Peace and Democracy Party (PYD) press service told RIA Novosti on Friday.
The police have repeatedly broken up protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Güler initially denied the construction, then stated that the wall is being built to ensure the security of the borders.
"Mayor Nusaybina Ayşe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle", the party's press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the wall's construction is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, as the Kurds have crossed this border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation that Kurds will never accept", Ayşe Gökhan quoted the party's representatives as saying.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaybin.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of ten thousand U.S. dollars a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars they have purchased in the country upon departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be determined later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost nearly 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was nearly 50 percent.
Petroleum Industry Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramírez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining prices on products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
This spring, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrei Belmach, the director of Yugra, said it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation happened only a few hours ago, so I'm not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach, - Belmach quotes ITAR-TASS.
A day maybe.
Maybe a month.
We're looking at all the options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find a coach, but someone who will work at our club for a few years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
This is a scary place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?,  the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which owns one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media judiciary "will always be biased as it is an extension of the government" and that the restrictions on content and advertising will harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies", he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to "take the media by force", while The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had received a "serious blow" and criticized the bill as "dragon-like".
The bill is part of a broader effort to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists on the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media has angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops who were sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
The reaction of the police chief David Kimayo was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the summons was canceled after mass media protests.
The new law allows publishers to be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists  up to one million with the added risk of being  excluded from the lists, i.e. banned from receiving official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the infringer's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations".
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on what she called Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
Politicians realize that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, characterizing Kenyan media as a key source of the restraining and balancing forces in public life.
"The self-righteous politicians will ruin the country and return us to hunting and gathering", he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the National Pay Commission and restore their huge salary of around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
The communal payments of the Voronezh residents will include a new line of expenses - the allowance for the capital repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the regional government.
But when to paint the driveway, fix the stairwells, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the residents themselves.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "In this case, too, it is necessary to establish order - to establish the order of the capital repair of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, it will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings".
The state controls the share building now.
The law protecting against fraudsters is approved by the board in the final reading.
The document was not born in a vacuum.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems were solved.
By the way, the new law stipulates rights and obligations for all participants in the share construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this sphere too began abuses, related to the fact that in the 98th year the same shareholders were caught, and in the 2000s the same shareholders".
People started making money off of it to cover up the loophole, including passing these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens who are subject to deportation.
The provincial legislature passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems of illegal immigration in the region are nothing to sneeze at.
So, last year, just over 100,000 foreigners were registered for immigration.
But only one in five had a formal work permit.
Where the rest of them work and pay their taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional parliament, said: "They have broken the law, but they are not criminals".
There's no trial, and they're being deported. They need to be contained.
The federation decided to equip such places at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - it is the Old Olshanka of Semilyuksky district.
And finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents of many children.
First, families with five or more children are exempt from the transportation tax.
That's a loss of $3.5 million, but it's a savings for a parent with many children.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt three or more children will be given housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
A family of six, for example, a father, a mother, a child of one and three adopted children.
For them, according to the regulations, the state acquires a dwelling of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
Left Bank or Southwest is a good option.
Well, you could buy a whole cottage at the fairgrounds for that.
Baumgartner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkali.
The current board of directors of OJSC "Uralkali" has proposed the candidacy of the general director Vladislav Baumgartner, who was arrested in Minsk, to the new board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bagertmuthner is on the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 29, where the new composition of the board of directors will be determined by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
However, later, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated at a press conference that the accusations against Baumgartner were re-qualified as "kidnapping".
The goalkeeper of "Neftekhimik" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikhunov from the post of the coach of the Nizhnekamsk.
The goalkeeper believes that acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys a great reputation among players and will cope with his duties.
We'll remind you that today "Neftehemik" has dismissed Krikhunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikhunov, - quotes Dalton RIA "Novosti".
I can only say that Dmitri Balmin will cope with the obligations placed upon him - I have no doubt about that.
He's a big authority on the team, and there's a great future for this young specialist.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming Italian Championship match against Parma.
As Football Italia reports, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the game's application to save for the match of the 4th round of the Champions League group stage with Real.
Also not participating in the fight with "Parma" Liichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quagliarella has recovered from his injury and is ready to play.
The tax maneuver will increase the fuel price, which provides for an increase in the extraction tax (ETT) on oil at the same time as reducing export duties and increasing excise duties.
According to experts, these measures can bring an additional 619,3 billion rubles to the budget.
The president of the Krasnoyarsk court was robbed of his ID by hitting him on the head
Unknown assailants attacked the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court Vladimir Dvoyekonko, stole his identity card.

US Secretary of State: Intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far" in gathering data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that the intelligence agencies had "gone too far" in their data collection and eavesdropping, but the politician said that the media reports of the eavesdropping of 70 million people were not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was wrong.
I recognize that, as does the president... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future", the secretary of state is quoted as saying by AFP.
Italian workers with experience give way to younger workers
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
The data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country's population is now unemployed.
Things haven't been this bad since World War II.
Among young people, the figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
One solution to the problem, Italian authorities believe, is to retire older workers early.
The country's largest energy company is already experimenting with this, and the laws passed allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement benefits for long-term workers.
On the other hand, Italy faces the ageing population problem that is common to Europe.
And economists are not sure that premature turnover is a viable strategy.
What will the construction of the TPU in Moscow lead to
Every year , the capital promises to equip more and more transportation hubs .
It is planned to put into operation 255 TPUs until 2020.
Our correspondent was able to find out what the project is really about.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was erected at the Smolensk Metro on the Arbat-Pokrovsky line.
The sign said that the transport hub was being built.
All this was very strange, since no ground transport stops near the "Smolenskaya" and, therefore, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolley bus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to overcome about 130 meters, including the overland crossing through the Karmanitzky Pass.
Smolensk is almost done.
The flower shop is gone, the newspaper stand is dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance is replaced with a brick.
So this is the whole transportation hub.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the capital's transport department.
No major T.P.U.s as yet.
The flat ones involve the construction of parking lots, the removal of commercial facilities that impede the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, flat-bed TPUs are not even transported, but professional developers from the capital repair department of the city of Moscow.
A transportation hub is not necessarily a complex construction, explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof overhead and a board to indicate the time of arrival of the transport are sufficient.
For example, a fully-fledged flat-bed interchange node has recently been opened at the Yasenovo subway.
No canopies, but with intercepting parking spaces and a sign indicating when the bus is coming.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials are writing down everything they see in the TPU.
Back in 2011, the city planned to build a total of 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now, the plans for the period up to 2020 include as many as 255 TPUs.
A hundred and fifty of them are promised for this year.
Although there is a program for the development of TPU in the city, no qualitative criteria have been identified, - Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport" states.
They report on the number of sites, but the quality of the transplants on each of them often deteriorates.
The expert believes there should be two criteria: first, reducing the transplant time, and second, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change transportation without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, the reverse is sometimes the case when the TPU is being built.
A vivid example of the VDNX metro.
In the past, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway used to come to the square in front of the main entrance to the World Heritage Center.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to Kosmonavtskyi Street.
Far from the subway, far from the monorail, but closer to the housing market.
In vain did the residents not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
The capital of the TPU in Moscow was not immediately clear.
The first one was built five years ago at the Planner station.
The project was meant to be exemplary.
And it really is a model of how a transit hub that was given away to investors to buy back becomes a trite shopping center.
No, there's a bus platform, a canopy to keep you out of the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
True, the Chymkhin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU were not given a place in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
But there's more room for trade.
There are 32 clothing stores alone, and there's almost everything from pet stores to car dealerships.
In fact, what if some of the passengers on the bus needed to buy a new car on the way?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason, it always turns into a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot was put on the market.
Now, on the third floor of the Plannerna parking garage, there's a fistfight in the parking lot.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards looking at our photographer with a grudge.
The transshipment hub has finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, there used to be a market at the Planneria subway, but it was torn down.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were allowed to enter the parking lot of the transfer station.
It's always empty because of the high prices.
The funny thing is, the market was torn down to build a new flat-top TPU.
It's like this.
The distance from the entrance hall of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly the TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it's closed, you have to go outdoors.
However, the structures on the "Planer" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon show flowers.
In mid-September, the city-planning and land commission of the mayor's office approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25 stories, not counting two or three underground levels.
The main monster will grow at the metro "Tushino", it will be 418,7 thousand square meters.
Representatives of the Russian Railways' railway station directorate, which is responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told journalists that shops, hotels and apartments will be located in the future multi-storey buildings.
Officials say that multi-storey car parks will take up from a third to half the area.
Take the example of the "people's" garages.
Say, the 258-car garage that was recently built on International Street is 8,015 square meters.
So, for a parking for 2,600 cars at the "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "square".
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let's get one or two floors for bus platforms.
That leaves at least 150,000 square feet of commercial real estate.
And that, for a minute, is almost two GUM.
If the capital TPUs at the stations and stations are built by railway workers, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by metro workers.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow City Property Department recently told reporters that they are working on a draft resolution that would allow investors to apply for a plot of land for TPU directly to officials.
No competition.
Because they say transportation is a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadayna station in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is convinced.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the metro level, and the approach distance from the metro car to the tram is only 50 meters without going out into the street.
There's no trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
We either don't build anything, or we're gonna tear down 25 floors of office and condo space.
Esser proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremism
To protect citizens' patriotic feelings from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Just Russia" proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activity and punish it with five years in prison.
As Izvestia newspaper reports, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheyev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government for approval.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, there are sanctions in the domestic legislation for violating the formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
In the opinion of the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be hurt by insulting state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not worked out enough in the Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the annual Victory Day debate, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the USSR people in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day, May 9 - a real baking party is held every year.
Some journalists, practicing wit and "alternative views" of history, have come to the point of saying that it is a pity that the cultured Germans did not conquer the savage Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual stronghold" of the nation, "says Oleg Mikheev indignantly.
In addition, according to Mikheyev, there are far more patriotic people in Russia than religious people, but the law punishes offending the feelings of believers, and offending patriotic feelings can go almost unpunished.
According to the elected representative, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to write in article 282 of the Criminal Code the appropriate punishment.
The bill provides for a penalty for insulting patriotic feelings: from 100,000 fine to 5 years in prison.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reports.
The quake's epicenter was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 November 1 in Moscow).
There have been no reports of casualties or damage from the quake.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismically active regions on Earth, so earthquakes of varying magnitudes are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
Then an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and its accompanying tsunami killed more than 550 people and destroyed 220,000 buildings in Chile.
In addition, Chile experienced the largest earthquake in recent history, a 9.5-magnitude quake in 1960.
More than five thousand people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Friday that the Greenpeace activists' case will be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can rest assured that the case will be held in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee the observance of the law", Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the Greenpeace activists arrested is a French national.
Pierre Pizanou, like the other activists, is charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture in relation to the detained citizen", Mr. Eero is quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to violate the law", said Dmitry Medvedev.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He emphasized that these objects are "like a powder keg", and reminded of what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN announces new goals to end poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to end global poverty.
Australian diplomats have been instrumental in pushing for the MDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that kicked off in Rio de Janeiro last night.
They were included in the final version of the document that world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, will sign at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the summit participants last night that it was time to put national interests ahead of the national interest.
I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals SDGs, he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, and they will be an integral part of the post-2015 development picture.
I will do my utmost to use the mandate given to me by Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing due to a conflict between powerful people
Under a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, looking down on them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant slogans for peace in one of the rare demonstrations.
"We want peace back; we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, the chief executive of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt emblazoned with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and the Renamo , some of the most violent since the ceasefire more than 20 years ago.
RENAMO was once a well-known rebel movement that was supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the Northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The governing Fremo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government was the instigator of the latest clashes, attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group's leader, according to Fernando Mazanga, a Renamo spokesman, to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
Guebousa told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "all the remaining strength" to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have grown after reports that Mazanga has announced Renamo's withdrawal from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to the failure of the Frelimo party to comply with the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness", Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two powerful people (Gebusa and Dhlakama) facing each other", said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither is a good negotiator, and neither is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reform, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to win concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The vote share for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party  Movement Democratic du Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Gebusa, who is due to leave office next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency", Mazzanga said.
It's unclear what Renamo's capabilities are, but it has already mounted devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south highway.
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo but includes Beiru, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railroads for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazzanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique", Mazanga said.
The instability has exacerbated discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is the government and the president who should find solutions to these problems", he says.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads", he said.
The series of premiere cinema shows "Art-mainstream" will be held in Moscow
The Art-Mainstream series, which will feature one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they go on sale, will be held at the Rolan cinema from November 1 to 5, RIA Novosti reports, citing the project's organizers.
The program "Art-Mainstream" will open with the French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost".
It's about a model working in the French capital, Mayet (Sam Kerichi), who is deported to her homeland, Morocco, because of visa problems.
In addition to the film Kerichi, the audience will also see the new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk "Mebius", the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: a love story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Adel Life" in May by Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian participant of the "Art-mainstream" will be the winner of the "Kinotavr" festival, the film by Alexander Veledinsky "Geographer globe of propyl" based on the novel of the same name by Alexey Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavr".
Children should learn myths and legends as "models of a way of life", says the author.
The sayings of the Torah might show that "brute force cannot defeat subtle cunning", and the legends of King Arthur show the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught in schools", Crossley-Holland advocates a "careful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been advocating for them to be part of the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the "excessive moralizing" of authors and teachers "diminishes interest" in children, and the main ideas are "sublimated" into entertaining stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon, and also wrote "A Collection of Norwegian Myths" for Penguin and "British Folk Tales", said: "You may have intentions, of course, but you'd better keep them to yourself".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything has to be easy or have a happy ending, but it does require an innate sense of right and wrong.
And it should be sublimated; revealed through history, not explicitly stated.
The old saying: show, not tell.
Football fan who smashed a window in a train station waiting room in Voronezh region detained
At nine o'clock on the evening of October 29 at the station of Gryasy-Voronezhsky transport police officers took off from the passenger train two football fans - native of the Moscow region.
On their way to a game, the boys threw a drunken party on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty station of the line police station at the station of the mud for the preparation of a protocol on administrative offence.
There, the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued an administrative file and let them go.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and waited at the station for it to arrive.
At 1:30 a.m., the fans left the train station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old man, suddenly returned and kicked through the front door of the station's waiting room.
The sound of the broken glass was heard by a transport police officer and a security guard of the Russian Railways.
They managed to apprehend the assailant, who was trying to flee the scene.
The South-East branch of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is conducting an inspection.
The question of initiating a criminal case is being considered, said the senior referent of the information and public relations department of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport, Sergey Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: What are the watermelons?
I think we're back to 15 years ago.
The Minister of sports Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots on the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartacus".
I'm all for the responsibility of the organizers of sporting events: the clubs, the league, the RFU.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They're waiting for someone from outside to come in and clean up.
That's a very good position, but not quite right.
We need to organize the fans, the clubs need to invite their stewards, not let the case run its course.
We've now developed a special government regulation on stadium conduct.
Once it's passed, we'll be looking into the matter.
But I'll definitely invite all the organizers of the football process to my place.
I read the interview with Leonid Fedun.
The government, please, make the law quickly.
I feel like it was the Bayern fans who came to Yaroslavl and set this all up.
We're just outside the door.
It's just awful to see the stage being sprayed with fireworks.
And this is in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back to 10-15 years ago", Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former US intelligence official Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify in the wiretapping case against German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from the representatives of the German prosecutor general's office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In that case, he would lose his refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by countries that are US allies", the source said.
"However, in principle, the German prosecutor general's office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden", the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of the wiretapping of the German Chancellor by the US intelligence services.
Snowden is prepared to give evidence to German law enforcement either in Moscow or on German soil.
The ex-CIA agent made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, to do so, we must clearly define all the conditions for his arrival", Shtrebele told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the Interfax source's statement, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how would be his own decision.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, and then leaked information about the secret operations of the U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, who had implicitly brought serious charges against him, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in "a large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported last week by German media.
According to journalists, the Americans began to listen to the phone conversations of the chancellor in 2002.
The surveillance station was supposedly located in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
German authorities have stated that the surveillance of Merkel violates German laws and sovereignty.
He left Fair Russia before he was old enough.
The deputy of the State Duma from the party "Fair Russia", member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev, filed a statement on the withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he submitted the statement to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "JustRussians".
We sit and drink tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal in this", - the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the "esers".
Meanwhile, the mandate of the State Duma deputy Ilya Ponomarev is not going to give up.
He explained that, despite his withdrawal from the party, he remained a member of the faction and by law could not leave it.
The news about the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the party "Just Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave the "SR" together with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of the conclusion of a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of the peace treaty", Kisida said at the meeting.
The Japanese foreign minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the two countries became warmer and took on a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, said that Russia would go to Japan to solve complex political issues, RIA Novosti reports.
The conclusion of the peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the solution of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today, demanding that the country return the land lost after World War II.
Cars in the Japanese capital are loudly proclaiming: "Return the northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protesters, they just make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker is a comedy show that is a part of the New York Comedy Festival.
It's safe to say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, stand-up comedian Frank Fay, a resident of the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in a conversational manner.
Fae's innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hersch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started in the Carolines and then they've gotten bigger, gotten to the point where they're too famous to perform in the club", Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sikes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mar, as well as a "Standup for Heroes" annual musical-comedy benefit concert for veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in unconventional ways, such as through shows on small TV networks like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll first gained fame for his role in the comedy series on the little-known cable channel (notably the fantasy-football-themed FXX sketch show "The League"), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been cast in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for her viral series Marcel the Crab in Boots.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with their own unique style (the surrealist-pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, the scheming, racially-focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comic, but later became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 he was the host of a show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the central element of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down the street between the two houses and thinks, "If I'm completely broke, maybe I'll live here".
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The Pakistani Prime Minister made the statement about the talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has announced that dialogue with the Taliban has begun", the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
- He said that he hopes and pray that the dialogue will work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan", - added the diplomats.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allied with the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwestern areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic state.
Earlier, the Islamabad government had attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only negotiate if the authorities would move troops stationed in Taliban-held areas to their permanent locations and release Islamist prisoners.
Nawaz Sharif is in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government, and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil has dropped to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about large reserves overshadowed a report that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The benchmark US crude was down 14 cents in December, and its price was $96.24 a barrel late morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was down 39 cents, which in total was a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The oil reserves have influenced its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. reserves have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was a hint of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after the third quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent from a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, the benchmark international oil used by U.S. refiners, has fallen 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the London Intercontinental Exchange.
Head coach Patrick Ruah, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, transferring from Dallas to the co-founder of SE Natalia Shmelev.
"Why should we wait?" Roa said after the morning roll of the Lavin.
Of course, we're all concerned about what happened, but we're confident in him and we feel it would be good for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely certain that the situation didn't affect the goalkeeper's condition in any way?
We'll see about that tonight.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him guard the goal, as they have done in previous games this season.
The important thing is, no one on the team is going to jump to conclusions until this situation is settled in court.
In Siberia, you shouldn't be a vegan: a greenhouse tomato is no substitute for a soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, a RIA Novosti correspondent found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here, they cannot survive the winter without health losses, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, according to the Novosibirsk dieticians and doctors surveyed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drinking oil by the liters
Strict vegetarianism, whereby one gives up not only meat and fish but also milk, honey, eggs, is becoming a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are convinced that such strict dietary rules are not good for health in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities.
Abstaining from animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids that are very difficult to replace with plant proteins.
"We have to be sure that we are not eating only milk or eggs", says nutritionist Marina Bogoi.
She cites fish as an example of the essential omega-3 fatty acid.
The most abundant vegetable oil is linseed oil.
"You need to drink a gallon of it to get the amount you need", says a nutritionist.
Doctors believe that Siberians should pay special attention to their diet during the winter.
Vegetarianism is especially in question this season.
The food we eat is highly demanding.
You need a higher calorie intake to keep from freezing.
"If you limit your consumption of animal products, you're not getting enough of these calories", says the expert.
This is the view of nutritionist Olga Pozniak.
She adds that imported fruits and vegetables are not the answer.
It is better to eat food that is grown in the area where you live or where you were born.
The genetic code is tuned to better digest and digest these foods.
And in winter, people don't want to eat cucumbers, but rather hot soup or something more nutritious", explains the doctor.
She says that vegan foods include grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples left over from winter, and frozen berries.
But that's definitely not enough for a full meal.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have their vitamin levels only from mid-August to mid-September.
In our harsh environment, where temperatures can change by 30 degrees a day and snow falls in May, it is not feasible to go completely vegetarian.
The body needs energy to live, and that is primarily fat", says the doctor.
Doctors point out that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Kids grow up, they need building material, including amino acids.
And by being vegetarian, we give them substandard.
Pregnant women also need more protein, vitamins, and trace elements in their diet.
"Vegans don't get it", I swear to God.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play with whatever toys he wants".
He has a fully formed body, skeleton, organs.
And yet, children need to be fed properly.
If parents deprive him of some micronutrient or amino acid by choosing what he eats, it's just a violation of his rights.
"The lack of certain substances for brain, vision, and bone development cannot be repaired tomorrow", she says.
All medical experts surveyed agree that the quality of winter greenhouse and imported vegetables and fruits is poor.
What we get from our farms and grow in greenhouses has less of the micronutrients we need than what we grow in open ground.
"The quality of the products is not that", says Bogoi.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of the producers to harvest more is detrimental to quality.
"Apples don't turn brown when cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, and tomatoes are tasteless and odorless", he said, adding that they are likely to be over-fertilized.
And they become suppliers of fiber, not vitamins.
This is not agreed by the head of the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, the candidate of science Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and all the rules and regulations, it's possible to grow healthy vegetables in greenhouses.
If you try to get more out of a square meter, you'll also have to water more and fertilize the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes grow fast, they are large, but watery and not sweet", she explains, adding that the question of quality is primarily a matter of the conscience of the grower.
The court has suspended the execution of a stop-and-search order on the New York Police Department.
On Thursday, the federal appeals court suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the NYPD's "stop-and-frisk" program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has stated that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin's decision will be suspended pending the outcome of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way it had carried out its program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city appealed her decision and the corrective action order, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police department change its practices and its training program.
On Thursday, the appeals court heard arguments from the parties in a motion to stay the case.
The appeals court said the judge had to be dismissed for violating the US judge code of conduct and for not considering the need to avoid showing bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unjustifiably targeting blacks and Hispanics under the Stop-and-Search program.
It appointed an external auditor to oversee the extensive changes, which include policy, training and oversight reforms, and decided to launch a pilot program to test the body cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York City decided to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases had been closed after police review.
The city's appeals hearing is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The "stop and search" tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Stop-and-search has been practiced in one form or another for decades, but the number of documented stops has skyrocketed under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an all-time high of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the "stop-and-seek" program at the New York Police Department say the changes will end the unfair practice, create a more reliable and effective police service, and could affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale rather than crime rates, will lead to unnecessary waste of money, and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police force due to the reduction of the number of officers by several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that it does not stop stop stop-and-search, which is constitutional, but it does change the way the NYPD stops people.
A pedestrian zone has been opened in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has been created in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a two-kilometer stretch from the Novokuznetskaya metro station to the Bolshevo Square.
Throughout, street vending machines, flower boxes, benches, urns and toilets have been installed, and dead fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushynsky alleys, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars - the Orda impasse, the Big and Little Tolmachev alleys, the Kadashev Embankment and the Swamp Square.
Traffic on the streets of Marousek and Petrovka is not restricted.
On the section of Friday Street from the vestibule of the station "Novokuznetsk" to the Klimentovsky lane created conditions for pedestrians without removing the movement and cutting the roadway, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the martyred Pope Clement, museums, libraries, monuments and other sights.
Previously, the Tver Pass, the Stoleschnikov alley and the Kuznetsk Bridge Street were completely pedestrian.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, has been closed to cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check the confidential message .
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a false report about the affair of then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
The Crown Prosecutor, Andrew Addis, told the Old Bailey that in May 2005 the News of the World newspaper had received false news that Clarke was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The paper had private investigator Glenn Mulcaire hack into Polby's voicemail and was watching her at home to conduct an interview, but Coulson was also calling her and leaving voice messages, the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, "is not the kind of person who would stand by someone's house, hoping to catch them by surprise, "he is the kind of person who likes to offer a story to people to see what they say", Mr. Edis said.
He said the News of the World used three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second one, the stakeout, he just has to.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yeah!"
The rumour of Clarke's affair first came to the attention of the News of the World, when a source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A tape of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcaire's home in August of 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private detective's computer that listed Ms. Polby and her sister as "Projects".
During the time she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Addis said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weiserrap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we're planning to publish tomorrow that I'd love to discuss with Charles".
Mr. Addis said that Coulson's involvement in this story was following the same pattern as other powerful people, such as former Secretary of the Interior David Blankett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had engaged in a confrontation with Mr. Blanket over an affair with a married woman while he was dating his female counterpart, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlbeck and Weaserrap have admitted to hacking phones.
Snowden says he's willing to talk to the German authorities about the wiretapping case.
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden is ready to travel to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so and meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
The former CIA officer's letter to the German authorities was presented by Bundestag member Hans-Christian Streubelle at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday, through whom Snowden passed the message to the German authorities.
Strebele had met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured in the fire on Tverskaya Street
As a result of a fire in a collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street, four passers-by were injured.
Interfax reports citing a source in the emergency services that one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, the victims were passers-by who were in a smoky underground passageway at the time of the fire.
According to the head of the capital's fuel and energy department, Pavel Livinsky, all houses on Tverskaya Street have now been fully restored to electricity.
A fire in a thermal collector near the house at 15 Tverskaya Street occurred on the evening of October 31.
Heavy smoke came from the storm drain, and a smokestack formed in the underground passageway located near the "Armenia" store.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were cut off.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
The U.S. is cutting food aid for the poor.
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 a month .
Starting Friday, the U.S. government's food stamp program, known as food stamps, will be cut back as the government's food stamp program expires.
Food assistance for a family of four will now be $36 a month less than before, officials say.
It's going to affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, the average monthly benefit for one person in the 2012 fiscal year was $133.
Food aid spending in the United States has risen to $80 billion a year because of rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food assistance, called "food stamps", which dates back to the days when they were paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
But Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be targeted at those who need it most.
Grocery store owners across America are worried that the cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. lawmakers continue to debate how to further cut government funding.
Blizzard has released a free 19-year-old platformer
Blizzard released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne for free on the PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available on Battle.net in the classical games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers have noted that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is also not yet available.
According to media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is not different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remains unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
It is set on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants are divided into the dark and light kingdoms.
Once upon a time, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlarose, Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Thule to fight against the followers of Sarlak and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its rebranding to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
New vending machines are coming to the Moscow Metro.
But they won't be selling tickets to passengers for money, they'll be selling tickets for seating.
A single trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 sit-ins.
The number of seats will be calculated by a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be installed at the station "Exhibition" on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new sportsmen will be hosted by the president of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and the Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
The NSA 's recognition is reinforcing corporate paranoia about state surveillance .
On a warm August afternoon, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence service, his assignment was to photograph the roof of the US embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the listening devices, and the actions prompted talks between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the US National Intelligence Service, reiterated in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of US companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But ever since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-contract worker, began releasing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate executives have been unsure whether to trust the director's word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency had been monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have raised corporate paranoia over state surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for perhaps a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then of course business leaders are potential targets.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence and companies.
I think it's very likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi association, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about it.
Someone in the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"This is not an option", says Gass Platner, president of German business software provider SAP.
If there is a need for a strong European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Still, the reach and technical sophistication of U.S. spy agencies made famous by Snowden's revelations came as a shock to some companies that had previously thought China posed the greatest surveillance risk.
A big shift is happening in cloud technology, where European company executives are becoming more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants dropped plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. intelligence analysis program Prism.
Jim Snape, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: "We're seeing that consumers are asking a new question that didn't exist a year ago, namely: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports only confirm what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What happens is economic espionage, not surprising.
It's always been there.
"It's been a topic of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy", says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we spy on them because it's in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders don't usually like to brag about the retaliatory measures they've taken, because it can give the enemy an advantage.
Big companies have long embraced the idea that taking a free flash drive to an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, to say the least, reckless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of Audi, says that for many years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service of Germany recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during trips abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their specific niche.
Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorised access,  warns the BfV report.
The U.S. is warning its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate in February placed France along with Russia and Israel in the second-highest rank of violators who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, The Washington Post claims.
A board member of a prestigious German company has confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Skarsini, the former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies".
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a "ridiculous accident" believe their son was murdered.
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up gym mat in his high school gym believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertical mat, leaning back against the bleachers in his high school gym.
Investigators with the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office have concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he did.
"They think it's against logic, against the laws of physics, and against common sense", said Kramp.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned him in a body bag", he said.
US attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that a preliminary autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia".
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed a different cause of death.
"There are some issues that need to be resolved or clarified", he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to release all surveillance video footage that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hope the video footage contains a key to uncovering how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about the people who hung the fascist symbols
On the official website of "Spartacus" appeared a statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance on the tribune in Yaroslavl fascist flag.
"At the Cup match between Shinnik and Spartak on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbols.
We ask that anyone with credible information about the perpetrators of this crime please provide it.
"Reward is guaranteed", the statement said.
We're looking for the fanatics who hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl.
In the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup, the match between Shinik and Spartak was interrupted several times due to riots on the stands.
Also, the fascist symbols were displayed in the Spartac fans' sector.
As a punishment, Spartacus can play three games without spectators.
There's a committee meeting on Friday.
If you have any information about whoever planted this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a recommendation for schools regarding allergies in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in school children.
This is the first such guideline issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies grows.
Now, one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools keep a supply of adrenaline  most commonly used for injections is the automatic medical syringe EpiPen  to assist in potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently amended the ordinance to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have developed an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I feel like something is sticking my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue", or "My tongue is pinched".
Intersex parents can choose their own gender
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate-type external genitalia.
No longer will newborns be assigned male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate the gender as undefined or undefined on their birth certificates.
The law was intended to relieve pressure on parents who may make hasty decisions about sex-change surgery and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man or a woman".
I'll be a doctor-made shard with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 babies born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sex developmental disorder", a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or sperms), or abnormally developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still poorly understood, but most experts in the US say that if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to take all available information and appropriate it rather than wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before surgery, if it ever happens.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identity, said the new German law "sounds like a good idea".
Intersex children are creating an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don't have them", he said.
You can have sex without surgery and then watch the personality develop.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very clear.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery of why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their condition is related not to gender but to their biological makeup, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, but is typical for both at the same time or is not typical for either.
These characteristics can be expressed in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts, and physique; primary sex characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosome and hormone structure.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice-based crime.
There's a special camp for boys with gender issues now.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to use either male, female or third gender in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as "genderless", having defended in court his right to retain an "undefined" gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F  X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in France, a strongly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is being sucked into a new state where sex is a matter of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning over two more pillars of civilization".
A mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer that her babies be assigned a gender at birth.
"Raising a child is hard enough without any extra constraints, especially if you don't know the sex of your child", she told a website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites  after the beautiful Greek god who possessed the marks of both sexes.
And as recently as a decade ago, the medical community was still viewing gender as a piece of paper that could be erased and then re-drawn.
But now many are questioning the ethics of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice without knowing how a child will perceive their assigned gender when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency", Dresser said.
When you had these babies, you didn't call a psychiatrist -- you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily modifiable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental cues, including social cues, how parents raise a child, interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether a person will consider himself male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a careless circumcision to castrate the child completely, removing his testicles as well, and to raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it was not so", Drecher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors still "apply this model" today.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex reassignment operations described themselves as "not satisfied with the outcome".
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate genitalia.
The doctors couldn't tell whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that he could never live "the life of a man".
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genitalia and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He started taking female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
He had a vaginoplasty when he was 18.
But when he was depressed and realized something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a developmental disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he found out, he became a man again by getting testosterone injections and removing his breasts.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he is an advocate for others in an organization called the Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersex people.
Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "incentives labeling and stigma".
Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an "undetermined sex", she said.
We fear he will facilitate the intervention.
We think it's better to give a male or a female and then wait.
But we haven't seen how this law will work yet, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamara-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their formal gender", she says.
German law implies that it is conferred at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not be engaged in at this stage.
When they grow up, they'll be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based mammography radiologist who has a daughter with a developmental disability and who helps hundreds of other people in support groups, said that the German law "supports" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sex development disorder called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at 29, Katie is married and is a resident in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time to not make hasty decisions themselves", Baracz said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to understand the situation, and also a time frame before they write "male" or "female".
Then you're right to raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows the children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that drives the parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing", she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which floor he or she is most comfortable with, and that is wonderful.
It gives the kids a chance to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolay Habibulin emphasized that he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the Hawks' last two games, Habibulin missed six of Tampa Bay's first four shots, and four of Ottawa's, and was substituted in the second game after a fourth missed shot.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I didn't do well", CSNChicago quotes Khabibulin.
- I need to find confidence in my training, maybe approach it as a game, and try to get the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on any flaws that you have.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good in training.
But somehow, after a few goals, it all turns into a snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers -- I don't think I'm the only one -- always try to make the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens outside my gate.
I'm still working on my own way of keeping track of all the chips.
It's great to have my teammates support me, but the bottom line is, I need to play better.
Two games isn't a whole season, but I wanted to do a lot better.
But what happened, happened.
I have to put this away.
I'm just gonna try to play better next time.

Medvedev expects that the aircraft SSJ-100 will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be supplied to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will get such agreements for more than 170 aircraft of this type", said Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The Russian Prime Minister noted that there is a strong cooperation with French colleagues, as this is a joint project.
We've been discussing some financial matters today, which are related to insurance, but we hope that once this aircraft is established in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will one day be delivered to France", the Russian prime minister said.
The SSJ-100 is a jet airliner built by the Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment of 100 passenger seats.
Dnepropetrovsk power company has launched a unique program to save... the nest of storks
In the old days, to lure storks into the yard, villagers would mount a wheel from a cart on a tall pole, and the heavy nest would hold well on it.
The owl's special support has long been discontinued, so the owl has chosen to use the poles of power lines - the interlocking branches that support the wires, making the owl's house stand solid.
Grandmother Anya, whose family of storks has lived near her house in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovskogo district, for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds are putting new branches on top, and the bottom layer is already sandwiched between the wires, about to fall.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of storks that nested in the yard every year, raised and fed three or four chicks in the summer, but you don't want to be without light either.
As soon as the birds flew to the warmth of the land, Grandma Anya called the Tsarichansky RES, which owns the stronghold.
I didn't expect them to respond so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, - said technical director of DTEK "Dneproplaneurgo" Sergey Berezovsky.
The wires, which were actually already inside the nest, weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, began to corrode.
The birds could have been electrocuted at any moment.
And the locals were at risk of losing power because of the damage to the wires.
So the line installers began a nest rescue operation, not the first time in our practice.
Scientists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University helped, and they developed a scheme for moving the nest.
They've been training the district network staff.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
First, it was estimated that there are more than 50 assisted living units in the region.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded, reminiscent of a funnel.
The foundation was covered with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
Experts say that the old branches can be used as a base for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
The vultures will finish their nest by themselves.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka, Novoskovsky District.
Next to the electric pole, a new concrete pillar was erected and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The whole operation cost the power company 9,000 hryvnia.
And the other day, a similar move took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, in the courtyard of my grandmother Ani.
Here, the platform was fixed in place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that careful, conservative birds will not even notice that their "apartment" has been overhauled in the spring.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected to be carried out in four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichan districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some people save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
The news of the tragedy that took place in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostol district, on the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot a family of swans living in the local pond for fun.
The noble birds were not afraid of humans at all - the locals fed them and did not harm them.
When the villagers heard the shots and ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead in the water.
Now the Apostol Police Department is trying to find out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The Russian March is becoming more popular
On November 4, the Day of National Unity, the "Russian March" will be held in Moscow, in accordance with the city administration.
According to a Levada Center poll, support for the Russian Marches is growing - 40% of citizens already approve of the idea of holding them to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens in different degrees approve of the "Russian marches": 11% of them are definitely positive and 29% - "more positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian marches" is gradually growing - in 2006, these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010, the holding of such events was supported by twice as many citizens (28%).
"Certainly negative" to the "Russian marches" are only 7% of Russians, "more negative" - 19%.
Another 35% were unable to articulate their attitude towards the action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed to hold a "Russian March" of up to 15 thousand people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital Alexey Mayorov said today.
This action of nationalists has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
When asked by sociologists "Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia held "Russian marches" under the slogan of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Now only one in five Russians (20%) know about this campaign .
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) had heard about the "Russian marches".
It will be recalled that three years ago on December 11th, a spontaneous nationalist rally took place in Manezhya Square, which turned into mass riots.
Levada Center also asked Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (People's Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of the population attends the festivities.
About the same number (17%) are willing to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow City Council coordinated the Russian March to Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the "Russians" association, the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
Besides the march in Lublin, a rally and a rock concert of the "Kolovrat" group will be held on the Day of National Unity, also agreed with the authorities.
How the Russian March 2012 went
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from the Yakima Embankment to the Central House of Artists, where a rally was held.
Organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6 thousand.
News: Obama campaign staff considered removing Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
The New York Times reported that President Barack Obama's closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ballot.
This is the opening of the most sensational and highly anticipated book on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Doubled the Stakes: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's closest aides conducted "large-scale focus group research and public opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's ouster could help raise waning hopes for Obama's reelection.
According to The Times political commentator Jonathan Martin, the book details the attempts of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the effect of former Secretary of State Clinton's appointment as vice president on the vote.
The possible replacement was a closely guarded secret in Chicago's campaign headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the replacement was under consideration.
The book "Double the Stakes" claims that Daly initiated the effort to replace Biden despite their "close personal relationship", but ultimately abandoned the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral roll would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was indeed considering a replacement for Biden Clinton.
"I was very vocal about looking at a lot of things, and this was one of them", he told the Daily.
You have to remember that at that moment the president was in terrible shape, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"
While Daley described the study as "a necessary test", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the campaign has invested heavily in studying whether this move will bring voting dividends.
"Pre-election campaign teams don't spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups unless they are serious about something", Martin told AK360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking into a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the possible mix-up.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president knew about the possible replacement, the former chief of staff admitted that Obama might have known.
Martin added that "Double the Stakes" doesn't provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political probing reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed Obama was unaware of the investigation into the possibility of removing Biden from the ballot.
"Maybe", Martin said, "but I'm not sure that's the case.
Would you like a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark jellyfish ice cream.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a luminous food.
He came up with the idea after reading a scientific paper on jellyfish, and he convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person eating it, raising the pH of the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, that means that the more you lick it, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me, I'm Delicious", says, "It's an amazing thing, but it's still in the very early stages of manufacturing, so for £200 you get about 2 grams of the stuff".
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it will raise the pH and the ice cream will start to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect for Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the luminescence of the jellyfish is four times the price of gold.
So each balloon costs me about £140.
It's actually quite tasty.
The Bristol-based Charlie's Experimental Company is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of sucrose gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to design invisible ice cream".
That's not possible by definition because of the fracturing of the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The coach of "Avangard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against "Salavat", noted that the Omichi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that "Avantgarde" should pay more attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website of "Avangard" the words of Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed out on mistakes, missed game assignments.
We knew the other team had performers.
They've had five hits in a row, three of them home runs.
Very well executed.
Were these mistakes factored into today's game?
Me and the guys, we're going through every game, talking after the game, getting ready for the next opponent.
The important thing is that the installation is done.
Everybody saw the first period of the game against Metallurg.
The game was played, and the score was 2-0.
They missed a goal in the locker room and they started to make mistakes in the third period.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in putting defenders in.
It's a team effort.
The Avengers are having a long home series, and the games are a day late. Is the team tired?
All teams are in the same situation.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and complete the game's mission.
Hockey is an emotional game, and if you do the setup, it's not that complicated.
Because of new regulations imposed by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been waiting in line at the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets
Hundreds of vans have piled up at border posts at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose because of a change in the rules for customs clearance of cargo.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the Russian side is creating the queue, which did not warn in advance about the innovations.
Since October 28, the Russian customs authorities have begun to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the Deputy head of the Eastern customs Vladimir Denissov.
The new document is used in countries that have joined the convention on international carriage.
The checkpoints are working in high gear.
FACT's correspondent visited the border and talked to the truckers who were held hostage.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are rising every day, as is the line from the van.
The trucks are lined up in rows, stretching for about a mile [2 km].
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veseli-Vozneshenka provides one of the most important transportation directions from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here the cargo is sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, they let us in until midnight, and then they introduced these rules, - complains Alexey Golovanev (pictured), a truck driver who transports cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need a supplementary package of documents and a cargo insurance payment.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4,5-5 thousand rubles (about 1,100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who are going to a nearby place (say, Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and travel.
And the rest of you are stuck, because nobody has that much money on them!
Imagine if a driver were to carry a cargo worth only $4,000, but to get to Moscow, he would need to pay 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 hryvnia) for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border are nowhere, lament truckers who eat near their cars.
The stores and cafes on the border are always expensive, but we've never seen anything like this!
The vendors quickly got their heads around the price of the bags: 15 hryvnias for a piece of bread, 7 hryvnias for a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias for a bowl of soup.
And the coffee is one.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet there.
No washing or shaving...
I can go a week without getting out of the car, my wife has everything ready for the road.
"I'll be here for a week", says another truck driver, Victor Skorarenko, who is trying to console himself.
I wonder if my car will be in line for a week?
We're interested in the only shop on the border.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnia.
What, a crystal bottle or a silver-plated water?
We're a coffee shop, not a store.
"Take it while there's still something", says the saleswoman.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the regional authorities.
The leadership of the Amvrosiye and Novoazovsky district state administrations received an order to provide drinking water to all those who stand in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, - said Sergey Dergunov, acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration.
The checkpoints are now staffed by ambulance crews.
Bio-toilets will also be installed for the convenience of the people.
According to the official, the problem with the queues will be resolved in the coming days.
As reported by the press service of the Donetsk Oblast Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were parked at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk" respectively.
The FACTS will be watching the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to smear the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such statement to BNS was made in the state security department of the republic (DGB).
The information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, Moscow is planning to "talk" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the special services, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the department for the analysis of social processes of the administration of the Russian president on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian people's party.
Also allegedly involved in the operation is an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the special service, Smirnov regularly visited Lithuania under the guise of scientific work until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the country.
The day before, Lithuanian President Grybauskaitė said she knew about the information attack being prepared on her.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the "aspiration of the country to energy independence".
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities more than once.
She said that the Kremlin was not treating Lithuania with enough respect.
In addition, Gribouskaitė accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of putting forward "only one demand" to Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
The quality of the products was reported to be inadequate to meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
The Lithuanian leader then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the country's government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, a school principal shot teenagers.
The principal of an American high school has literally driven teenagers to despair.
The man, he says, was forced to take up his weapon and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw toilet paper at a man's house.
The school principal fired at the teenagers, injuring a 15-year-old boy in the leg and arm.
Since the bullies were not on the principal's property, he's being charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from jail on $125,000 bail.
It's important to note that the targeting of civilians in the United States is becoming a frightening pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest, California, U.S.A., directly at a passerby on the street.
After that, the perp took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier today, a shooting took place at a Newtown Elementary School in Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
Gunfire in an American school: 14-year-old girl wounded
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and perform a masquerade for our neighborhood.
I'm more of a scrapbook now.
I haven't been called to give out candy in my apartment for the last two years, and I probably won't be this year.
But the statistics show that I'm a white-washed Halloween crow.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans - 158 million - will be celebrating Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations.
The one thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent on costumes will be spent on clothing.
This year, the hot topics are the sexy, uninspired items.
Women no longer have to be sex workers; they can also be sex food, like pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for the men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I'm sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will be in our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are searched the most are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet suits this year.
That means a lot of funny dog-dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't cut corners.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey's chocolate, candy, Milk Duds, chewy Twizzlers and the Clark Bar candy bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-eating children who have prepared to take over our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and - let's not kid ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate on Halloween.
The one thing we don't want to eat is candy in the form of cornflakes; and yet, according to the National Pastry Association, nearly 35 million pounds of it is sold on Halloween.
That's about nine billion individual corn kernels.
It's a mystery I have yet to unravel.
Nothing says Halloween like a haunted house.
They have amazing names, like "Fear Behind Walls" (which is actually a prison, by the way), "Wow and Scream" and "Shock House".
In fact, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in revenue, and there are those amazing pictures of you almost getting wet that your friend posts on Facebook and you can't get rid of, and then the guy you like sees that photo and leaves a comment like, "Class face".
And then, finally, we're going to talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we've done since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the baby pumpkin trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
The Jack's lamp slowly drying on your porch probably came from the state of Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you want a more challenging task, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Estonian Ministry of Defense restores site after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The Estonian Ministry of Defence website has been restored to working order after a cyber attack this morning, the ministry's press service reports.
According to the vice-chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for information and administrative issues, Taymar Peterkop, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our technicians quickly fixed everything, and the site is now back up.
"The damage to the ministry is minimal", Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it's too early to say who organized the attacks.
"We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents completely", he admitted.
On November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted a message on the Internet confirming the hacking of the Estonian Defense Ministry website and opposing the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians don't want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should be nobody's slave.
We are for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine", Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the naval infantry company of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian naval infantry will take part in the command-staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
The violence of the evil forces has forced the closure of several schools and hospitals.
Four schools in the southern province of Matabeleland, Zimbabwe, have been forced to close because of attacks by... goblins.
The local elder said that the children would panic and that it was impossible to continue the study.
The story of the goblins may sound like a child's story to a European, but in Africa it is a serious argument for closing schools.
Adults are afraid of evil forces, too.
In Zimbabwe, for example, a hospital was closed in the summer because of the goblin attacks on the medical staff.
The Land Rover series is announced.
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communications system.
Additional benefits include upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and car storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally participants who are calling Bowler have changed".
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are delighted to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as preparing participants for the challenging conditions and realities of rally-raid.
We've been working very hard on the Defender Challenge car, and it's going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces have no knowledge of the Brotherhood group - Novye Izvestiya
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement bodies of the Russian Federation.
"After media reports emerged that the US Treasury had put Leps on the watch lists for suspected membership in the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brotherly Circle', we searched all databases, but found no such group", the agency's source said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As reported by "NI", yesterday the US Treasury Department published a list of suspected members of the "Brother Circle" criminal group on its website.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He's listed as "Grisha" in the list posted the day before.
The data of the popular Russian performer coincides.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
Besides Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another ex-Soviet citizen whose citizenship is not specified.
The US believes that Grigory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, was transporting money for the bandits on their orders.
The message is accompanied by a photograph of the singer and all his data, which corresponds to reality.
In fact, Leps has recently bought a house in Phuket.
The department said they intend to impose sanctions on Leps.
Blacklisting a person by the US Treasury Department entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps's assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications had been received by the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the Grigory that everyone is talking about in connection with the scandal in the United States now".
All Leps knows is the media coverage.
Officially, there were no notices to him personally, although I don't know if they are in such cases.
"And of course, it's all funny on one hand, and surprising and unexpected on the other", she told RIA Novosti.
She says that Grigory Leps doesn't live in Phuket, but the US Treasury says he does have a home on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had caught up with him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
The one who ran out of the "Shinik" game.
Some details about the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during the 1/16 final match of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslavl "Shinik" and the Moscow "Spartak" became known.
As stated by the head of the KDC of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He's in custody at the moment.
"Grigoryanc also spoke about how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this, let's call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He walked into the ambulance, the paramedic confirmed it.
And then he pushed the two escorts away and ran into the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South stands to the corner of the East and North stands.
He ran across the field.
The stewards are responsible.
Until the sports law comes into force, this is the steward's zone, the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the grandstand, climbed over the East Stand.
And at that time, riots started on the East Stand and on the running tracks", the head of the KDK said.
Recall that by the decision of the KDK, Moscow's "Spartak" will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian Championship against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenita", as well as pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire crews were called in to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry.
Cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after being in a minor car accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in a quarry, and a man walking her dog spotted her.
Firefighters rope down a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death.
The puppy was lucky to escape after fire crews were called to pick him up and transport him to safety after he somehow got stuck 50 feet up on a dangerous slope.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after being in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days in solitary confinement before being rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were frantically looking for their missing dog and posting appeals on social media sites after she ran into a quarry after a minor accident.
At approximately 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a keen dog walker spotted Ruby stuck on a 50-foot ledge in a quarry.
The technical rescue team from Clackmyton Fire Station rushed to the scene, descended on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a stretcher to lift her up the hill.
Rescue squad officer Andy Clayton said, "She was in a dangerous position".
It was right in the middle of a steep slope about 50 feet to the top and down to the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during the rescue, she was frozen.
But she's okay now.
Then she ate a cookie.
It was a very unusual call.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue squad specialist officer Peter Law said: "Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued".
There was a chance that she could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and it was determined that she was all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was terrifying".
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing to have her back in our arms.
The vet said if she had been knocked unconscious, she'd have probably fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them has been absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson, of Keetley, added: "We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there".
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she ended up there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star revealed that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard".
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rock star, and noted, "He flirted with me when I was 18".
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind".
In a statement Thursday, a spokesman for Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies that he ever hit for Katy Perry".
The spokesperson added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else".
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Carevan: the break with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the European Free Movement Area as a condition of EU membership.
There's a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the barbed wire border along the Adrianow ramp.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although  predictably  it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time twisting their formal rules to suit their own convenience.
Since Scotland is now outside the Schengen area, continuing to flout the requirements would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a story worth telling.
And so old that it's become a fossil: I first heard the joke that "independence is passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting point lost in retelling the old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland obey Europe's orders at all?
Why trade London's yoke for Brussels' yoke, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or in favor of abolishing the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded just this year, emerged from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially ousting the Free Democrats (analogous to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a watershed moment.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles placed on national economies through the maintenance of the single currency, have led many people to think that the 'Europe' project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits, and that was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has locked its members into exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe is already at a disadvantage in terms of production potential compared with Germany.
The only lifeline is to cut salaries and public spending, which Berlin is actively supporting.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper problem of Europe's productive capacity.
As a result of the package of 'green' energy measures introduced by Brussels, a 'code' that means subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the US.
It's a paralyzingly unfavorable price situation, as we've seen before in Grangemouth.
No wage freeze anywhere in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
The result is a riot brewing, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needed Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and had already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France's shattered economy in a mess.
The result is that the right-wing, anti-EU Marine Le Pen party, the National Front, has just won a decisive by-election, knocking the ruling Socialist Party into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote a timely warning to British Labour that it is not possible to assume that a split in the right will automatically be reflected in the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - and this is very likely - anti-EU parties win support in these elections, the bloc could for the first time take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
My view is that soon the growing anti-EU and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to the sort of vague "Europe of nations" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and a few dependent economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I suspect the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to draw closer to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests the possibility that Britain will be left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
What position does that leave Scotland in?
We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland can thrive in a freer European arrangement, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating the Norwegian experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is  oddly  the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity, having won an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections to the spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence now just to accept austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging before the age of puberty
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, studies show.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is near.
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty.
The tendency to early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter's breast and pubic hair begin to form at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent the new normal.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents", Kaplowitz said, "but that doesn't usually mean full puberty is coming soon".
Obvious signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and arthritic hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there's been only a small shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 years in 1970.
"After the breasts start to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the menarche", said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: how to deal with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate way to check how puberty will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes actual puberty, but it is considered "premature" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in height until the age of 8.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone ageing, which can eventually lead to stunted growth and poor growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental level, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is cautious about medication, but admits that "suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers".
The other big problem is obvious: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle the hygiene issues", said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating when she was 10 years old.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many widely publicized theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environmental chemicals, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Both boys and girls reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise that holds the most weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, early puberty appears to be affected by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys develop facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency toward full puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and toddlers are prone to acne and pubic hair.
"We have to be careful about how we define true puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryea Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not feel uncomfortable asking their pediatrician for guidance on how to talk to their child.
"This could mean an earlier than expected conversation", Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need to be reassured that even when it happens before their due time, it's a normal part of life.
An American Boeing stuck in Cheetah is preparing to take off.
The American aircraft, which had conducted observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Wednesday, will leave the city's air harbor on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time.
The airport authorities have authorized the departure of the boat, having received money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will be flying to Ulan-Ude.
Other reports say he's headed for the United States.
It was reported that the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Transbaikal Territory due to fog.
Unpaid bills kept him from the Chita airport.
The plane was carrying 30 people, including the crew, who spent two nights inside the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
As reported in the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the terms of the Treaty on Open Skies, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to leave the limits of the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only in two Russian airports - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and has 34 member states.
Observation flights are made over the territories of Russia, the USA, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to develop transparency, facilitate monitoring of the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, and expand the possibilities for preventing crises and resolving crisis situations within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do deceased celebrities earn - MK in the US MK
The highest-earning living celebrity in 2013 was Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was outflanked by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous earnings from October 2012 to October 2013 totaled $160 million.
It's lagging behind other celebrities who have died, who last year "earned" several times less.
The second most "stable" celebrity in Forbes' year-end list was Elvis Presley, with $55 million, and the lowest was Peanuts author Charles Schulz, with $37 million.
Elizabeth Taylor, who was last year's leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million) also made the top five.
Also included are Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
Igor Gulyaev 's first boutique opened in Moscow
On October 23, the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now they can be appreciated even more by fashion fans - in Moscow finally opened his first boutique, which the designer and hosted a party in the style of dolce vita.
I'm sure that Russia has the most beautiful girls.
So I'm especially glad that I opened my store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's a real part of me.
With these words Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted to try on the models they liked!
Jet manufacturers are fighting over seat width when big orders are at stake.
A bitter dispute has erupted between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, with the size of the space allocated to them playing a key role in the claims of efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would require a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class, but its main U.S. rival Boeing says that's for airlines to decide.
The dispute comes as aircraft manufacturers compete to sell ever larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the event on November 17-21.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft  especially whether it seats 9 or 10 people in a row  is central to the claims of economic efficiency of new mini-airbuses projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will seat 406 people, based on economy-class seats over 17 inches wide, arranged 10 in each row.
Airbus says that a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats arranged in a row of nine.
Aircraft giants often exchange punches on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is turning directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to lead with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new advertising war could be like by showing a slide to the financiers showing three people in a restaurant clutching each other, titled "Would you agree to this?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than those of regional turboprops", said John Leahy, Airbus sales manager.
As people's diets change, they gain weight, but the seats on planes have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American male age 40 to 49 gained 10 percent more weight, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The average waist circumference of a 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to the U.S. Public Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the seat concept of the 1950s, when the average waist circumference of those recently called the "reactive public" was already.
Airbus says it commissioned a study showing that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' seat size figures and says manufacturers should not interfere with airlines' decisions on how to balance fares and comfort.
She says that research shows that comfort in a cabin is not just about the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they need to do to be successful", said Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver.
They don't want us to decide what's good for them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it's about increasing the space on the sides, but for suppliers, it's increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race to order planes worth at least $700 billion at list prices over the next few decades - enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As first reported by Reuters in July, the seat layout is what's fueling the rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent increase in profitability per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's stated characteristics are partially based on comparing the 10-seat 777X rows with the original 9-seat layout of the 777's structural solution rows.
The gain in the specific cost is reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout currently used.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make their aircraft more competitive compared to our designs", said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus' passenger comfort division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the full 10-seat cabins for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating arrangement that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"Eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial standpoint, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat of the 777", said cabin interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't supply seats, but they do offer a catalogue of suppliers that airlines can choose from.
Jet vendors traveling the world even carry their wheels to check out competing layouts.
All manufacturers also offer airplanes with very dense cabin layouts for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a 10-seat A350 but says it hasn't sold one yet.
Until recently, Airbus had emphasised the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider aisle spaces on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern aircraft, experts say her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from the 777X sales surge.
A new nicotine vaccine may make smoking less fun
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could make smoking a pleasure-free experience.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from lifelong nicotine dependence.
More tests are needed before human trials can begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early results are encouraging.
"We are very hopeful that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried all the methods available on the market today to quit, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to be overcome with these modern tools", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued their normal activities.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine were "relaxed", a sign that nicotine had reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be done so frequently that they were expensive and impractical.
But the new vaccine will probably cost much less because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the urge to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get the pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that may help them to get rid of the habit", he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: one third of Moscow suburbs are fully subsidized
Vice-governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
In total, 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 are 100% subsidies.
Within the budgetary provision from the regional budget is sent about 25 billion rubles", - said Oleynikov.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many districts is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough at all".
The expenditure on the maintenance of the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is over 70%, "while the quality of services is declining", said Oleynikov.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of the municipalities of the Moscow region to consider by the end of November which settlements need to be enlarged, united into urban districts or changed the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Before that, the governor of the Moscow region stated that within the framework of the administrative reform in the Moscow region it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
There is also a request for the enlargement of municipalities in Mojai, Kashir, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomenskoye, Lubertzach and Kotelnik districts.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Moscow State Duma Igor Bryntsalov also stated that it was planned to unite about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region within the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidized.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she derives from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenina now devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to mess with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their education, but also entertains as much as she can.
Twice in the last week, Diana has testified to her fans about her teaching talents.
First, she posted a picture on Facebook of herself teaching children to read.
And then yesterday, she made a huge splash by showing off how she dressed Artemis and Martha for Halloween.
"We're ready for the broom race! Our first halloween" - that's what Diana called a photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is not surprising, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have a connection to this holiday, because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe to introduce "genderless" for child registration
Germany will become the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born to hermaphrodites, instead of male or female, to indicate "undefined".
Parents of the child will have the right to leave the gender field of the birth certificate blank for a while.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents can temporarily write "X" (undefined).
This decision is designed to avoid parents being rushed into having sex reassignment surgery.
According to statistics, one in every 2,000 newborns in the world is born a hermaphrodite.
Tripod denies being influenced by Obeid.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Trippody will be a suspect in an investigation by the state's anti-corruption watchdog.
Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi denies changing the lease of the coastal properties at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obed lobbied several state ministers to extend the lease on Cerqueular Key, where the Obedids own two restaurants and cafes, without passing a tender after it expired in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's clandestine involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynn Ashpoole on Thursday.
For several years, starting in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for open competition.
The landlords were against it, and they wanted longer leases.
In 2009, the lease of the enterprises on Serkyular Key, which brought the Obeids about $2.5 million a year, was extended without a public tender.
Mr. Tripoli, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially favored open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, was strongly advising changes to the government's rental policy.
The ICAC transcript of the phone conversations provided was a conversation between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr Obeid in the Fisheries Department, in August and September 2007.
'Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing policy?' asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley to Mr Trippodi.
"No", said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the targets were Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
On at least two occasions earlier this year, Israel has launched airstrikes on missile cargo inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas may be tested for authenticity
The "authenticity" test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it envisages expanding repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, would be applied to criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457 visas to fill unqualified positions or as a loophole for family and friends to move to Australia.
The government's submission for discussion was released today, while former Labor MP Maxine McQua criticized the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
High-profile statements like "foreigners  at the end of the line" and "Australians have a job" represent a very unpleasant throwback to the times when unions demanded a protected labour market,  she told the Australia  India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor was the one to be protected  and if some in the region saw echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document presented for discussion outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday meeting with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes, with the rest being considered.
If the 'authenticity' criteria is accepted, the visa applicant can be examined for authenticity in circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of subclass 457 visa holders, as previously, businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of an apparent heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat in Christmas Island this week.
The man's grief-stricken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his journey to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Semen Varlamov's girlfriend said the hockey player is an alcoholic
The friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamov, Evgeniya Vavrinyuk, said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking", said one woman.
Vavrinyuk has filed a lawsuit for beating Russian goalkeeper Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by the hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her arms, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came to Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing the incident in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete's movement around the country, but forbade him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study to improve the economic impact of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The HS2 project will provide high-speed connectivity to Scotland and the north of England, with Phase One starting in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "unite the UK".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "thrilled" at the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be extended to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements to the railway's capacity and reduction in journey times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim with HS2 is to create a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together".
We're developing HS2 because the benefits that it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we're facing a capacity crisis on our rail network.
But it's also about connecting cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better connectivity thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown has called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: 'The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scottish economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK.'
So we are pleased to be working in partnership with the UK government to explore options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating a win-win and continuing the Glasgow to Edinburgh railway that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to discussing the findings with the UK ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Torium is the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world are still thinking about how to meet their energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy requires large areas of land to generate.
Nuclear power costs nothing, but it leaves a lot of expensive waste in its wake.
Recently, scientists have turned their attention to thorium, another radioactive element in the Mendeleev system.
It is found worldwide, and experts say that its decomposition does not leave a residue that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers on Australian airlines will continue to be required to switch off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite the easing of regulations on these devices in the US.
The Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in "Flight Mode".
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which required American airlines to do a huge amount of work to comply with the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The FAA also said it was reviewing the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
"The FAA currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft", it said.
This is governed by regulations requiring air carriers to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety rules as communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already been discussing with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its onboard Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not opposed to the change, but said it would follow the regulator's guidance.
"We would welcome the CASA's consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that we have it on our planes", the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would stick to the rules in place at the time.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no plans to change that anytime soon", she said.
The FAA's decision applies to all U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the FAA's decision and the reasons that prompted it.
For US carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, and also review manuals, training materials, hand baggage regulations, and passenger instructions.
"Once the airline has tested and confirmed the noise resistance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude", the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the flight crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, the group recommends that heavier devices be placed under the seats or in the overhead luggage compartments during takeoff and landing.
The head of Dagestan is hearing the notes of extremism in the Kuban anthem
A football match between "Anji" and "Kuban" turned into a political collision between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kuban anthem sounded differently.
Dagestan President Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday suggested that the republican parliamentarians should file a lawsuit because the Krasnodar region's anthem is allegedly calling for ethnic strife, in particular, for war with the Basurmans.
Take the anthem of Krasnodar Krai, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a disgrace, and nobody's doing it.
"We are going to the death fight, remembering you here as a mother, an enemy, a Basurman" - why write such words in the hymn, to poison some believers on other believers", - expressed solidarity with Abdullatipov, the chairman of the parliament, Hizri Shikhsaidov.
Putin has secured impunity for his friend Assad.
And now, news from overseas, namely, from Syria, where we learned today that Israel struck a Russian-made missile that was reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of a Russian-brokered agreement that allowed the US to avoid a military operation that they came close to this summer.
For more on the weapons and what it means for the Syrian president, see our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from the poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal that Assad's friend Vladimir Putin made.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is a milestone.
A group of international experts has reported that Syria has shut down alleged chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term, more difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
We understand that's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
It's not a question of if it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer legitimate and he has to go.
But Assad is staying.
And he feels more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are scattered and ill-armed.
His people are forced from their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad has escaped punishment for his mass murder.
The chemical weapons deal is being hailed as a diplomatic success, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made an impression of a cooperative man.
In Washington today, the US ambassador to Syria was asked some tough questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is not relieved that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is holding.
He's trading his guns for power.
President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing and Communal Services
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry overseeing construction and housing and communal services and offered to head it to the ex-governor of the Ivanovo region Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and communal services are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development.
Mikhail Men is the son of the well-known Orthodox priest, the archpriest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Chemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995 his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergiev Posadsky district, was a State Duma deputy, first vice-premier of the Moscow Regional Government, vice-premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanovo region.
Singapore pawn shop owners are doing well, while the middle class is struggling.
In a pawnshop at Singapore's Bendemeer Mall, Janani Amirthaligha puts a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested in it", says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its business, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
A jewelry loan  is not only a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, slightly above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, the advantage of the pawnshop is that it does not require credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
So millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and the rapid growth of household and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by loose monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for diminishing incomes as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, pointed to the increase in household credit, largely due to the growth in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely emerged from a technical recession.
Thursday's data showed continued decline in exports and weaker consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income brackets] will look for ways to supplement their income wherever they can", says Song Seung Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people pawn their personal belongings as they take the opportunity to cash in on their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold items.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month".
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest operator of pawnshops, has seen a rise in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemire branch and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also beyond Asia, says Yeh Li Ching, ValueMax's executive director.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have been criticized for their high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the pawnbroker not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.
"Customers are mortgaging items they already own, and monetizing personal assets is not increasing household debt", she says.
Zakar is gaining increasing public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And it is not just those in financial distress who use pawn shops.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary cash difficulties", Ms Yeh says.
Sometimes they just need money really fast.
The issue for the population today is not the number of health facilities and their status, but the quality of care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernisation of health of the Tula region for 2011-2013", reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure of medical assistance to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant and women giving birth.
Thus, after the merger with the maternity hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the GUZ "NGKB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity hospital was significantly improved, modern equipment corresponding to world standards appeared.
Over the years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the capital repair of the premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased for the amount of 42 million rubles.
The newborn intensive care unit is equipped with the latest equipment.
In the operating room, a SELL-Seiver machine is used to collect blood from an operative wound and return it to the woman after special treatment, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
The clinical laboratory diagnostics department is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women's clinic has an electronic registry, and it is planned to introduce electronic medical history and medical records in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, women giving birth and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens have beaten and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechen nationals arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation had been underway since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The gangs reportedly recruited prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then beat and robbed them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old woman, a previously convicted Chechen.
The defender of "Bavaria" David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he outperformed the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the mountaineer Marcel Hirsher, and the third by the ski jumper Gregor Schlierensauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the German Cup and the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavin's ex-wife is having a good time with actor Andrei Chadov.
The former civil wife of the footballer of the St. Petersburg "Zenit" Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends her vacation together with the actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadarognya, her fiancé - figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrey Chadov.
The couple's photos from their joint walks were published on Anastasia Zadarognya's Instagram.
This isn't the first picture of Andrei and Julia together.
On October 5, Zadarzhnaya published a photo of the couple standing together on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the "Zenita" havbek Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civil wife Yulia.
Let's remember, Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003 and they have three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to a top corporate executive.
A $325 million rescue package for the health of Tasmania
The federal government is insisting that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system be supplemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanja Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and systemic limitations.
The decision to fund the four-year programme was made after the government consulted with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state", Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a planned blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help to overcome the backlog.
There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston to improve outpatient care, train health professionals, mental health services and introduce personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
"This investment will go to the best doctors to deliver ideas on how to better support the Tasmanian health system", Ms Pliburseck said.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian Government would operate in a strictly accountable and accountable manner.
The state would need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds, and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person committee will be formed to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million is not going to solve anything unless it is followed by real reform that puts Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing.
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first addressed to the prime minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will be a significant contribution to bringing the state's health care system out of crisis", Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional selection procedures largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But federal healthcare opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement represents a "decision, similar to a Band-Aid".
"The reason we're here is because the state's Labor government has taken $430 million out of the health care system", he told ABC TV.
When the state government is cutting almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth is putting in 300 million, you can't pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton has asked Mrs. Pliberecek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout will be spent on extra bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niclou's screen adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts exceptional staging and historical detail, but it's also harder to take than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sex-spoiler and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
A film never descends to vulgarity or sensationalism and that's the problem.
Because of its solemn gravitas, the narrative risks becoming a test of the will-o'-the-wisp for the audience as well.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says monitoring group
Syria has destroyed major chemical weapons production facilities and poison gas munitions, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as fierce clashes raged in the north of the country near a facility believed to store toxic materials.
Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the country's civil war began nearly three years ago.
The statement from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The Hague-based organization has set a November 1 deadline for Damascus to destroy or "decommission" all chemical weapons production facilities and the mechanisms that allow chemical agents to be mixed with poison gas and used to fill munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of the destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that sets out to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of its existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The statement came amid fierce fighting on Thursday in the town of Safir, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production facility and storage site, according to the Britain-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracked the deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, as mentioned, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said 29,954 were members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 were pro-government militants and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead, the statement said, were 2202 army defectors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a UN estimate on July 25, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
That number hasn't been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting for weeks in Safir against rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides Thursday, but didn't provide specific numbers.
The fights highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are being driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team was "now satisfied that it has inspected and seen all critical production and mixing/fueling equipment" claimed by Syria destroyed.
She added that "no additional inspection activity is currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections, visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two locations for security reasons, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... chemical weapons program items located in them were moved to other reported sites that were inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether the Safir site was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW executive committee.
"I applaud the courage and bravery you all have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization", said the Observatory's Director General Ahmet Uzumcu in a commentary published by the OPCW.
The civil war has been raging for three years, pitting the mostly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are made up of members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shi'ite Islam.
As for other events, the center's director Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Latakia, Syria.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over sentence for Bali attackers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 victims of the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators to stand trial, saying that Omar Patek should be executed by firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly a decade on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the creation of the explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released for 15 years if he gets parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Coota, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also convicted of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for life, though they could have insisted that a man dubbed "the bomber" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker should be sentenced to death.
The decision compounded the painful memories of June Courtin, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He should be brought before the firing squad, Ms. Cortine told AAP.
 I have to live every day knowing that I will never have grandchildren again and I will never see my daughters
The Sari club was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in an outside van was detonated just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's bar where a suicide bomber had detonated a backpack packed with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he went into a coma for a month and died three times while on life support.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of the three other members of the terror cell responsible for the bloodshed, Jamia Islamia, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not that much.
Patek is the last of the Bali terrorists to appear before the court.
He went into hiding for nearly a decade, but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent revealed that intelligence evidence indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He did not give up", said Mrs. Courten.
Until recently, he had no regrets about the pain he caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be commemorated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year", says Mrs. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his conviction.
FAW: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from mobile phones) 
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on their mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Wuerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft are meeting the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device stacking regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon", the FAU said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They're not supposed to restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aircraft is being lowered for landing and must not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and cruising, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gulading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that), it will be a win-win situation, Gleeding said.
We're frankly tired of feeling like "school watchdogs" when it comes to this issue.
But Internet access for surfing, emailing, texting or downloading data will still be prohibited at altitudes below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
So, still no  Words with Friends  smart internet game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when a high-profile incident occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was on the approach to land.
And heavier devices, like laptops, will still need to be stowed in the trunk, as they can injure someone if they're flown around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory authority over phone calls is the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the national expert on transportation safety for CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
Cell phones this is a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air, Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been mounting on the FAA to relax restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Democratic Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no sound security reasons for the bans.
It is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce these restrictions as the use of devices becomes more widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigational and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers  the high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA as being resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Wirth said.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when they flip through pages.
But the signals get stronger as the devices upload or send data.
Among those who have pushed for easing restrictions on passengers' use of electronic devices has been Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-reader devices and flew it around to check for problems, but they never found any.
Members of the FAU advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports from pilots that the devices could create interference with aircraft systems, and most of these reports were very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off their devices during instrument landings in low-visibility conditions.
A group of travel industry representatives welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step toward the passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security", said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Auto schools will be able to conduct driving tests
Driving tests will be taken by private companies that have their own computerized driving test.
This is reported by Kommersant, citing the draft government decree "On the admission to driving vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are now about 30 such tracks in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" driving schools will be counted as internal testing results.
The State Motor Inspectorate will monitor the passing of the exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the pitch students fail the first time, that school will be denied privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft government resolution will come into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for learning to drive two-wheeled vehicles.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take the test in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign licenses.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian licenses after passing the exam.
A bird airlifted to safety from a North Sea drilling rig is released back into the wild
A bird airlifted to shore after being found in a depleted state on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was put on a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month and then flown out by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at a rescue centre in Alloa.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "This water-herder is most likely a winter migrant from northern Europe who has been caught in the high winds over the North Sea".
It appears the bird has lost its strength and found shelter on an oil rig.
He added: "She was unable to fly again, so we were called in for help".
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Are the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and identify the changes that Britain's wealth and job creators want to see in the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to share their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders representing a wide cross-section of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for opportunities to export outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritise new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in Europe's trading zone,  even 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed.
The latest and most telling finding from our survey of business leaders is that a clear majority want the UK to pursue a treaty-reformed course and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is pushing for a "significant change" that will bring power back to the UK.
The stakes are high  achieving a change in the treaty and more favourable terms for the UK would provide a 16 per cent swing in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
It also shows that business expects the overhaul to result in a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British businesses are possible and increasingly necessary as the euro area embarks on the path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as our survey shows, for business this means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory activities of Brussels.
US intelligence is listening to the Pope 's personal phone .
The Vatican's activities are closely monitored by the US intelligence community.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection reveal that U.S. intelligence has been bugging all of the previous Benedict's talks, and is now closely monitoring Pope Francis.
His phone was tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The election of a new pope was also monitored.
What the U.S. was all about.
The Secret Service tapped into the cell phones of the cardinals who were in Rome to elect the next pope.
The phones of the residence where the conclave participants lived were also tapped.
American spies have been listening to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the emergence of a figure undesirable to Washington.
The Panorama magazine reports that "the big ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the end of the conclave on March 12.
It is claimed that the United States has nominated Argentine Archbishop Bergolio as the next Pope of Rome since 2005.
American intelligence also leaked the negotiations surrounding the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
An Italian magazine reports that a secret CIA/NSA team is still operating in the U.S. Embassy in Rome, gathering intelligence on political and financial movements.
The Vatican, in turn, has conciliatively declared that it does not care about the American "tapping", even if it is taking place.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the U.S. government.
The snowboarder for the Olympic ticket was photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday released a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, which will host the Olympic Games this winter.
The denomination of the bills is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively poking fun at the commemorative banknote.
After the Olympic coin was unveiled on October 30, they noticed that the snowboarder's image on the bill was found in photo banks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo repository, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
It's also been used in RugGear smartphone ads.
The Olympic banknotes are in a blue-blue range.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and the Hot Bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and trampoline jumping, but snowboarding was chosen as it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is concerned about the public's opinion regarding the widespread distribution of the image of the snowboarder on the Olympic banknotes and is currently studying the situation.
The government isn't too concerned about the Olympic bill.
The head of the press service of the State Flag, Natalia Nikiforova, told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
Snowboarders on the banknote are turned to the right, in the photos on the network - to the left, - Nikiforova said.
A person in a photo shoot to create a bill was photographed from different angles, then the final image was selected, which is the characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknotes, as the artist received a salary for the work.
Experts say the debate over the image on the Olympic coin is positive.
Recognition of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion, - said the executive director of the NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovich.
It's difficult to prove that the images on the bill and the banknote are 100% identical, so it's unlikely that intellectual property lawsuits will be successful.
The first time an Olympic banknote appeared in China was at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, when a commemorative 10 yuan banknote was issued.
Russia has decided to continue this tradition.
Legislative bans have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
They predict that the beer consumption in the country will remain the same next year, at best.
Although the businessmen originally expected growth.
This year has been a bad one for them, with sales down 7 percent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Shepps, told all this at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Tovars of everyday demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It was about government regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, as the country has seen a significant increase in regulation of the brewing industry in the last few years in terms of the production and circulation of beer - a beverage with little alcohol content, Schapps told listeners.
No other country in the world has such a tight restriction on the beer market, with the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are supposedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many of the laws designed to reduce alcohol abuse are not having much effect, but new initiatives are constantly being introduced.
The biggest blow to beer producers was the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks, which was introduced this year.
"We lost 35,000 customers in one go", said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two predictions for next year.
The optimistic one, the one Sheps was talking about, is that the sales of the bubbly will stay the same.
Pessimistic, another two to three percent.
To keep their profits, businessmen are forced to move from mass-consumer beer to premium beer, which is less but more expensive.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of the drop in sales of small amounts of alcohol are yet to be seen.
"My observations show that the rate of alcoholism is about the same", said narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who use substitutes for strong drinks and those who "snap" into alcohol-containing tonics like "Yaguar" has increased, whereas a decade ago it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 workers were laid off from the Ford plant in Vsevologsk.
The unions say all the redundancies were compensated.
But more acute than the problems of the workers is the question of the decline of industrial production in the region.
The regional deputy of the Zaksa Alexei Etmanov at the meeting said that the factory of the company "Ford" in Allovolazsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened back in September: then, under the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the trade union organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to quit voluntarily were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left their jobs voluntarily.
However, according to Etmanov, that number of people is a whole night shift.
I think it's going to be more than that.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support the regional enterprises in difficulty in the next two years", he explained, adding that the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs when adopting the budget.
Ford has not confirmed or denied this information.
We're waiting for the company to respond, and as soon as it does, we'll be sure to publish it.
There's been talk of cutting jobs at the Ford plant in Vsevolovsk for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to lay off 600 employees were announced in September.
Earlier, the plant announced that it was suspending car production.
The reason for this was the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4% in the first nine months of 2013.
Vehicle and equipment production declined 11.5 percent.
In the United States, you can use your mobile phone during takeoff and landing
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of airliners have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC.
U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets on flights, with the new rules to take effect by the end of 2013.
However, internet connections for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometres.
Due to the risk of interference from aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will remain off-limits.
This will allow passengers to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of electronic devices in flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that they can handle the supposed effects of mobile phones on aircraft equipment and controls.
The source said that, like the US, the UK may also be reviewing its current regulations on the use of electronic devices in flight.
The Russian mafia in the US has finally adopted a new name - "Brotherhood"
This week, the blacklist of the Russian mafia in America has been updated with four new names and companies.
The US Treasury Department has admitted three Russian representatives, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli to the "Fraternal Circle".
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, who the US suspects of transporting money for the members of the group.
In total, the United States has blacklisted 22 people connected to the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts doubt that such an organization really exists.
"The Brotherhood statement is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups", said Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor and organized crime expert.
In his opinion, "Brotherhood" reflects the popular perception of "Russian mafia".
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who can confirm the existence of such a criminal organization", Mr. Galeotti is quoted as saying by the U.S. Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti is joined by George Mason University professor Liz Shelley.
"If they are acting together, it is more like a criminal network than an organization", says the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brotherhood is more closely aligned with the Russian thief in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Granddad Hassan.
The criminal authority was murdered in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashova, who added to the list in 2012, were closely connected with Ded Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoyev, was a nephew of Ded Hasan.
Nevertheless, Mr Galeotti notes that some personalities are not related to Usouyan.
He felt that they were all more likely to be united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - in the "Frat Circle" has drawn the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why he was included in such lists, "said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Lepse) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Just like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Gazprom's head Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the Gazprom chief said.
"Today marks a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun", Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which holds most of Russia's gas destined for Europe, raises the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price once the entire project is operational in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries along the pipeline's route by the end of the year.
The pipeline's annual design capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staff have been accused of sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord were brought to the Royal Commission.
Two YMCA NSW staff members were accused of child sexual offences before charges were brought in 2011 against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse reported.
But the commission's opening statement said it had "never dealt with any cases of child sexual abuse within its organization".
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case where a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the attorney assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but he didn't know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA had also been inaccurate in its opening statement to the commission, arguing that "there have been external audits by the YMCA that have acknowledged that the YMCA is at the forefront of ensuring the safety of children".
The submissions indicate that the YMCA was informed that it had received the second lowest of four possible scores from the Department of Education and Communities' quality audit in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and his subordinate leadership made mistakes in hiring Lorde and failed to ensure that staff clearly understood their obligations to report violations of child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offenses against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was sent to prison for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that the YMCA's corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting Lord's child safety violations.
The employees testified that they witnessed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally babysitting them, putting them on his lap, saying he loved one of them, and allowing them to play on his cell phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under the Lord's tutelage and asked to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child welfare manager of the Caringbah branch of the YMCA, who was the Lord's tutor, "very frightening and often difficult to reach".
The CEO said he doesn't accept employees' explanations that they were uncomfortable reporting the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord had put them off the thought of reporting him.
Mr. Hare said that he had presented to the New South Wales YMCA board his view that the lesson for the organization from the "incident with Jonathan Lord" was not about the provision of information by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA General Director of Child Care Liam Whitley.
He said it was to prevent evidence from being tampered with, but that it was "over-exerted" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-safe organisation during the tenure of Jonathan Lord from 2009 to 2011, child abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbown of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearing is adjourned until December 20th.
It's the fashion week in Sao Paulo.
She's not just a model in her homeland, she's a star.
Although Giselle Bundchen has left her job for a while to focus on motherhood, she has come to this week's parade on purpose.
Her months-long absence didn't stop her from maintaining her place on the podium and the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she was in the Kolchi show.
Fashion week finals are usually the most interesting shows.
Like the one that the stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of pret-a-porter luxury class, the designer is actively working in theater and cinema, designing performances and designing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile and fashion industry participated in the closing fashion week in São Paulo.

Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
The night before, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician laid out his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussion of British politics, limiting most of his commentary to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East peace quartet.
Asked if he would return to the prime minister's office, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that it will happen, so ... "
Head coach of "Milan" Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the draw in the 10th round of the Italian championship against "Lazio".
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries to the leading players.
I'm very sorry that we didn't manage to win", Allegri said.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
We didn't let Lazio get anything in the first half.
In the second, the Romans added, but overall I can't say we lost focus.
We should have won.
Last season, we accomplished our goal of making it to the Champions League.
We're behind schedule right now, but that's because of a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
But we're still a good team.
Look at Kak who's had a high-level meeting.
The experts in the equestrian events, who came to Cardiff to compete for the 'Horse of the Year' prize, knew that the competition would be very fierce.
But no one was ready for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, having taken his first steps only a few months earlier, this toddler and his pet Shetland pony, Toffy the Fox, raced through three rounds to easily claim the top prize, leaving 30 adult competitors far behind.
This inseparable pair of the same height received high marks for their looks, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sannibenk equestrian centre in the town of Radry, near Cardiff.
As he stepped out into the open view of men and women in elegant bowler hats, he pulled his hat back and proudly led the two-year-old Toffy around the circle.
The judges praised Fenton for his age-old innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffy got a high score for looks and character.
Fenton got Toffy for his third birthday last March, and he's been training with the Shetland pony every day since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffey make a beautiful duo".
They had a lot of rivals, but these two went away with the gold cup and the rose.
It was only his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been displaying horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "The whole audience was amazed, and they all shouted and clapped".
He ran the length of the arena on the sand, and although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is an animal lover - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chicks to care for.
The way he's started, he's going to be in the "Horse of the Year" contest soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A representative of this annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony".
They make a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffey for their looks and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They're judging the consistency of the pony and the breeder. Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he looked really good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the call is subject to reorganization.
A Chinese newspaper that published a front-page call for the release of a defamatory reporter is to be reorganized, the press regulator says.
Guangzhou's New Express newspaper made a surprise public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yunzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he took bribes for writing false articles about a state-owned company.
Now, the new express has to go through a "complete error correction process", the regulator said.
The order to "correct the errors" came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group-owned newspaper New Express had published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial staff of Novy Express was disoriented", the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that it has been decided to "impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yunzhou by revoking his reporter's license".
He also directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to fully correct the errors in the New Express and recommended it to investigate the newspaper's officials and immediately make changes to the New Express's leadership.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, claiming financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page calls for his release, saying it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television to admit that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion, the entire news media industry and its ability to earn the trust of the public", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was hungry for money and fame.
I've come to terms with my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express published a front-page apology, saying the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of coercing confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to the law that prohibit authorities from forcing anyone to confess.
US-Mexico drug tunnel discovered with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail system.
U.S. authorities described this tunnel, four feet by three feet, as one of the most complex underground passageways they had ever discovered.
This zig-zag tunnel, almost six football fields long, connects the warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which facilitate the clandestine loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in the tunnel's discovery.
Three men, who law enforcement said were drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, they face prison terms of 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use the vast underground drains to transport the waste.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after the October marijuana harvest, which gave the drug cartels a tough task of getting their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard passageway with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of a home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions to be increased in Belarus from November
In Belarus, pensions have been raised since November this year, the main pension management department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection told BELTA.
From November 1 this year, the average salary of workers in the republic, applied in the previous pension recalculation, will be adjusted with an increase of its value by 5.4% and a corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be made in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 "On increasing pensions".
As a result of the recalculation from November, the labour age pension is estimated to increase by an average of 5.3%.
The average pension for old age will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November of this year will increase by Br274.3 billion in the monthly calculation.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of the labour pensions, the minimum and social pensions, the surcharges, increases and additions to pensions will be recalculated in November this year in connection with the increase in the budget of the average per capita subsistence minimum.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than that in the period from 1 August to 31 October.
The minimum pensions, social pensions and surcharges, increases and surcharges to pensions will be increased by 2.1% from 1 November.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion was set aside for pensions in 2013
British police handing Assange an extradition notice
British police today handed over a notice of extradition for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had handed the 40-year-old Australian an official "surrender notice" demanding he turn himself in to the police station, adding that he would be subject to further arrest if he failed to comply with the demand.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, seeking political asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard has issued a formal surrender notice to the 40-year-old man, requiring him to report to the police station at a time and date of our choosing, a spokesman said.
He's still in violation of his parole.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears extradition from Sweden to the US for possible espionage charges after the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
Driver driving 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined £1,000
A motorist was fined £1000 for driving at speeds up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police pulled him over, they found a drink between his legs.
At Colchester Common Court, Howie pleaded guilty to a charge of driving without due care and attention.
Adding seven penalty points to his driver's license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 in costs and an additional £100 to help victims of crime.
The tax on foreign property ownership will cause the London bubble to burst.
The Treasury has completed a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% rate of government duty on houses worth over £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own homes in partnership rather than as individuals.
At this point, the property tax on residential properties in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which was £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, is already greater than the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, the north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber together.
Mr Cook stated: "After the increase in the excise duty on expensive houses and the introduction of the related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated, regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system".
"But this move could result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy property in London or current owners being reluctant to sell", he added.
The value of prime real estate - the top 5/10 of the price-of-home market - in the affluent southwest London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady 5.6% year-on-year growth, but were overshadowed by the booming domestic market, with prices surging in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how a dog's tail movements are linked to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs wag their tails to the right (from the dog's perspective), while anxious dogs wag their tails predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the canine family can detect these subtle differences in tail wagging and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Valortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: "It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are involved in the formation of the stimuli that produce positive and negative emotions in different people".
Here we've tried to look at this in other species.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the tail wagging of other dogs, researchers observed the animals as they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the animals' heart rates and analyzed their behavior.
We may soon understand why their tails sometimes point in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We showed the dogs the dog videos, either the naturalistic versions or the silhouette, to get rid of any other distortion factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and point the tail more to the left or to the right".
When the animals saw that the otherwise unresponsive dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the tail-waving dog), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was tilted predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of a wagging tail dog), their heartbeat increased and they looked worried.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other by these gestures.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they should worry about and which ones they shouldn't.
He notes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and their tail wagging in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then the dog responds based on this experience".
The researchers say these findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animals' emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting research fellow at Bristol University's veterinary school, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a team of researchers at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads left when they see an aggressive dog, and right when they see a contented dog.
And in another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported that "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when their tail was turned left instead of right, rather than becoming agitated, the opposite of the Italian study".
He said that the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies didn't fully perceive the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to study how dogs respond to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is ample evidence in different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it's likely that we'll soon understand why their tails sometimes point one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys are postponing their Glasgow show because of Alex Turner's illness.
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a Glasgow concert after their lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was supposed to be playing the Hydro City Concert Ground on Friday.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will name new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will be appointing his first group of people who will ultimately be involved in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the papal election - a prerogative of the group of 120 "election cardinals".
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as a consistory, would be held before the inauguration.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the consistory in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline by February.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as it takes to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The concistoria next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis' election in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance", he said.
South America is home to 40 percent of the Catholic population, but it is represented by a tiny number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals - a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad used to do everything himself.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we've never been in this situation before. This is all new to us.
Valero said popes usually elevate to cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis is "full of surprises" so we don't know who he'll name.
GM is recalling a number of new pickups in the U.S. for reworking the backs of the seats.
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address issues with manual seatback tilt, according to a notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators filed Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the backrest tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"In a rear-end collision, a helmet may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury", says a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's pickup truck launch in June is the most important vehicle launch for the leading American automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.
GM notified the pickup truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider a notice to owners due to the 16-day government shutdown that slowed car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model lineup, rose by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups, which were the highest ever sales.
GM's shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The cry of despair of the Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to undermine commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify the problems with the website of Obama's health care reform, the drone attacks.
The memoirs of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would lift me up during my downtime in second year medical school and give me a new sense of hope.
It's called "Courage to Win", and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patient reports in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speaking could take your breath away.
The election was a resounding victory, and the news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists was about to arrive at the White House, and the people were ready for a change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his approval rating was 82 percent.
Then I close the book.
Coming back to the present is a rude awakening, like being plucked from a dream.
It's hard to recall those days of optimism, they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my ballot, change has indeed occurred.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I give Obama credit for his many and varied accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to pulling our troops out of Iraq, repealing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the ability to choose public health care, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay among others.
But after countless times I've sided with the Obama administration, defending it to colleagues and peers, I'm running out of explanations to offer.
I've reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain the permission to bug foreign leaders or the drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the NSA's collection of Americans' private information or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing.
It cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or the failure to respect public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusion that the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration".
And lately, he can't justify not being able to develop a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Was I supposed to understand at the age of 18 that leadership could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
It's clear that running for elected office is not a predictable agenda, as our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and by random events like the Newtown massacre.
However, all of the examples I've listed above show that they were largely the administration's own choices.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a vague and crude alternative, seemingly incapable of making a decision about his own politics or beliefs.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would live up to the expectations we've been hearing about for so long.
However, with Obama's approval rating dropping below 45% this week, going back to 2008 with this book has become much harder.
It makes me miss a lot of promises that have gone unfulfilled.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton handed Obama a roaring defeat in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of the failure, he told his staff that they should get back on track and stay true to their purpose.
"I want us to be attractive again", he said.
We must remember who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I agree with you completely.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris alone.
Clive Palmer claims that Congressman Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the matter of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made the statement as he tried to dodge questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's combined party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to scrap carbon taxes and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be in the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether they get the leave or not", Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast Fairfax by-election by 53 votes after a recount.
Mr. Palmer has called for a review of the voting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should the decision on this election be made two months after we vote?
"We need to have a more perfect system", he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you can come in, type your data into a computer, vote right away and get the result at 6:30 that same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for markers on ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil seems strange these days.
The Election Commission is studying the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would "take his new job very seriously".
Public office is a service to the community.
"We are not getting any awards, except for the thanks of history, for being able to serve this district at a critical moment", he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders from its currency trading unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, further evidence that a global probe by regulators into alleged currency manipulation is gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be removed in the course of an ongoing investigation that echoes the LIBOR manipulation scandal.
Refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received information requests from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation of this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the matter said that RBS had passed on the records of emails and instant messages that its former trader had received and sent to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, is on leave from his current position as head of European spot foreign exchange trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Asher's IM contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to people familiar with the matter.
UBS Bank announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust body Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking into allegations that bankers colluded to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are looking through instant messages and e-mails for years looking for cases of wrongdoing.
The news of the inspections has alarmed traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest sources of revenue for investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been hit hard this year as low currency volatility has reduced opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation by saying that a vast and highly liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that's not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the forex market, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the wider use of banks of their internal platforms means that "you can start to influence the market for a very small price".
The news comes on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it was firing one of its London Stock Exchange trading desk this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The bank has notified the relevant authorities immediately and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe that the trader acted alone and that the matter was localized", Credit Suisse said.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama 's health care law .
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health care law is constitutional, in a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that individual provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the government's taxing authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the Health Care Act's requirement that states increase Medicaid compliance or lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally compelling.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by every major Republican presidential candidate during the 2012 primary election season, including would-be presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the reason for the feud?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the "Open Tribune", politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals were the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because this game is all scandals and strife.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that to reduce "the degree of tension in society", politicians and the media should be correct in their statements.
He must have been referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who on one of his TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they didn't want to limit the birth rate...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion a tumble.
Maxim Grigoryev said that the events in Biryulyov - "a model conflict that could be predicted", but "for these questions we answer too many people and instances", and seven nanny child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced in relation to migrants, according to the publicist, has failed, and we need to find our own way.
Historian Yuri Petrov has high hopes for a new unified history textbook.
"We still need to create a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa", he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal liability for "calls to dismember Russia": "If in the USA you say on the radio that you should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "incite".
As usual, he blamed the journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: "In the dust of controversy, there is little to say!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasilyev, advised the journalists to sign a "charter" and agree to talk about this topic carefully, and then the same obligations can be taken by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole is established, said Mr. Vasilyev.
As an example, he cited a law that places responsibility for inter-ethnic peace on regional and municipal authorities.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share her enthusiasm about this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what is the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and limits.
So subjects will interpret the scope of those powers differently.
And the municipalities don't have the staff to deal with these complex issues, they don't have the resources, and the center doesn't give them the methodological guidelines that they could use...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Affairs, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the creation of a special department with the formidable name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who headed a similar department in the 1990s, which was subsequently abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have a special man at the federal level, a "minister without portfolio", to whom one could turn if anything.
"We are walking along the edge, shells are being thrown side by side, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support", - said the representative of the ROC for relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
There should be no state neutrality in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, in his opinion.
Here Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to be found, but they are pushed in the wrong way, not on that road", he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "Sometimes the football player is beaten by the whole crowd, sometimes flags are burned, sometimes comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"There is no one in the world like them in this sport!" the sportswoman said warmly.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus!
You'll have to offer them curling!
You have to know the national characteristics, it's like offering a Georgian "Zaporozhets"...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club were distinguished by their wild behavior on the stands - during the game with the local club.
Football has to be banned all over the country...
Head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation of Football Association Artur Grigoryants reported that the "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports from the House of football correspondent "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the torch-burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stand during the home match of the 14th round against "Anji".
There were representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We've examined all available materials.
For the misbehavior of the audience, Kuban was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei are being sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, which it overcame at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents cover technology that helps match keywords on the Internet to the corresponding ads, which is the foundation of Google's search business, the lawsuit says.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable for comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are all making phones running on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered Nortel's patents for an initial price of $900 million.
Google raised the bid several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this deal, the Motorola patent library was a determining factor in part.
Despite an unsuccessful attempt to auction off the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them, the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt's first freely elected president takes oath
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in, but the day of his inauguration is unlikely to mark the end of political strife in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he took the oath as the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are seeking a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life of absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability", said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence was a banned organization, a target for the tough actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak's time, traffic was stopped only briefly to allow his motorcade to pass along the usually busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi has been derided as the uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the "Brothers", his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and Friday's speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate of not only Islamists but all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today", Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-paneled courtroom where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra playing the national anthem, during which he stood on the "smirno" stand.
The military man was present, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan "Army and people are one", which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and promised to restore the powers of the president that were stripped from him by the military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the oath before a court rather than parliament, as is customary, he is fulfilling the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region was held at the Yaltorovsk Automobile Plant.
The event included the presentation of a new line for the production of electric steel welding pipes.
As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov told, in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market for the sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric welding pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production on it.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of produced products have been shipped.
The investment in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for thermal industry, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in personnel by more than 50 workers.
The company is in the process of retraining its staff and selecting the necessary specialists from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit for longitudinal steel cutting up to five millimeters thick, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another machine, with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company plans to master the production of pipes, which are used in housing and communal services.
The company's management aims to cover up to 70 percent of the Tyumen region's needs in this product.
Deputy director of the department of investment policy Leonid Ostrumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also the aim of the state support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its leasing.
This year, it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for this purpose, and two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The final committee, which will review the subsidy agreements, will accept the documents from the enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget covers the costs of local producers' participation in international fairs.
The budget for next year is 150 million rubles, which can be used to offset leasing payments and loans for new equipment.
$5 million will be allocated to fair attendance, $3 million to energy conservation programs.
The funds for the compensation of the ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostrumov, in the future this form of support will cease, since the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the tax on the extraction of minerals, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present they do not and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the regional government considers direct support of industrial enterprises as a priority, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget support will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation with the oil companies.
The subsidies on the equipment they buy are a competitive advantage for the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if they are abolished, it will be difficult to compete on price with the middle of Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the issue of the succession of the new owner of TNK-VR - Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The Uvatsky project expires in 2013 and no renewal has been requested.
At present, the enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil produced in Uvatsky district will be paid to the regional budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic will serve 240 hours for extremist social media post
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk has sentenced a citizen to 240 hours of forced labor for posting an extremist video on social media, a representative of the regional court's press service told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to court documents, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Russian Federation Criminal Code "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as at humiliation of human dignity committed in public".
"The Lenin district court considered the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, imposing a punishment of 240 hours of forced labor", the agency's source said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of goods prices after signing the association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this in a conversation with readers of his Facebook page.
I can say with certainty that prices are determined by a number of factors, among which are, among others, customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would have to come down.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries", Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, still, there should be no price increases there either.
Therefore, the messages on the billboards, which have recently appeared in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, this is not quite so, or to be more precise - not at all", Azarov concluded.
Investigators are checking reports of child abuse in Biesko .
On October 29, the media published a report that a nursery school teacher in Biysk had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently investigating the circumstances and giving a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After being accused of foolhardy , Evgeniya Vasilyeva spoke .
Evgenia Vasilyeva, who has been the subject of media attention for almost a year, has never commented on the numerous publications in the press about the thefts in the Ministry of Defense, nor about her personally - her relationship with the former Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her passion for valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the "Oboronservis" case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyev stated: "Originally, of course, the task was exactly the same: to extract from me any negative information regarding the former Minister of Defense".
There was blackmail to make me testify or I'd be thrown in jail.
As of today, those threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of winning.
However, the interview suggests that perhaps Vasilyeva was most offended by the words that she was not interested in taste.
Probably, the statement of the official representative of the Russian Federation's Security Council Vladimir Markin is meant that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the figure of the "Obronservis" case, fakes were found.
Among the seized property are a number of paintings that the mistress, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expertise appointed by the investigators after the seizure of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap forgeries", Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from the Defense Department, and said I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss my personal matters?
I think it is just a mess", says Vasilyeva.
At the same time, when asked if she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes she is accused of, Vasilyeva said: "Naturally, no.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading the public, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the Russian Federation's Investigative Committee that Vasilyev is refusing to study the materials of the criminal case, the defendant's lawyer stated that he and his client "do not allow the investigator to get acquainted with the materials of the case".
What caused the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and has not spoken to the press?
Perhaps the woman couldn't resist the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the Komsomolki journalists right, who a few days ago claimed that she "fell into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of news about Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
The well-known military commentator of the "KP" Viktor Baranec in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "The investigators do not exclude that after such a shock she may become more talkative during interrogations".
Earlier, Vasilyev was accused of illegally selling real estate to the Ministry of Defense.
It's the winter.

In autumn, it is better to choose a copper-containing preparation, such as 1% Bordeaux mixture or preparations of Abiga-Pik, Oxychom, Ordan, etc.
You think travel agents are history because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be going the other way.
The company has updated its full-year earnings forecast and is expecting record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its core full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 and $340 million, compared with a previous forecast of between $305 and $315 million.
If current benchmarks are met, this would represent a 1217-percent increase over the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/2012.
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had posted 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half with good figures, especially on weekday trips to Australia and the UK.
"We have been operating profitably in our 10 countries since the beginning of the year, and some of them are expected to record record profits before interest and tax contributions for the full year", he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are usually our biggest contributors.
In Australia, leisure business rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Her U.S. business has recovered losses incurred during a seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to be profitable for the third full year in a row.

The equipment was confiscated.
In the near future, the materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who brutally beaten two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to "New Region" in the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, on the eve of the day in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after the extinguishing of the fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Ural Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
The identities of the dead were soon established.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them - a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years old, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented the flat that burned down a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under personal control by the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs agencies are working out various versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons inclined to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose of the women's rent, where they lived before, what they did, and who they had relationships with.
Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar
School English courses will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British fiction from 1914 onward.
The exam will also feature "external texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English and English literature course will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final exam in language, with English literature being strongly recommended as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula in English and math tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
He's going to make changes to the other core subjects next year.
The separate examination regulator OFQUAL will introduce a revised structure for secondary school leaving exams, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to regain public trust", insisting that school leaving exams be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours per year, while Singaporean students give about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to give more time to maths in the schedule, sources in the coalition said that the large-scale school-level exams in maths, combined with an increased score on the rankings table, will likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on 'real-life tasks', including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2 200 rubles
From tomorrow, tourists will be transporting their boats on airbags from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe.
For those of you who want to go to China , that means extra expenses .
A ticket to the Puma is traditionally considerably more expensive than a steamboat.
According to the information service of the company "Amuraso", the cost of a normal ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
The ticket for the high-confort hall will cost 2800 rubles.
By the way, this season the tickets are not expensive: at the same price, the pumas were transported by tourists last spring and last autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes Russia's GDP growth rate is insufficient and believes the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy to focus on innovation, Reuters reports.
We've been planning for a 3% GDP growth this year, maybe a little more.
The real figure is just under 2%.
And in the context of the recession in a number of European countries, it doesn't seem that bad, but it's not bad enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, we need to have a higher rate.
It is very important now that Russian companies, Russian businesses receive normal loans at normal prices - this is the first thing that must be done", the head of government stressed.

Traveling through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bvelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Blewell and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
In this West African country, there are not many doctors  just one for every 5,000 people
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bvellet is one of the top 10 CNN heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 heroes to be CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bvellet watched his father come back to life and fall into a state of unconsciousness again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bvellet was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would haunt him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", Georges Bulle said.
If we had money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, for years, Bvellet accompanied his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
"It's not easy", said Bvelle.
You can leave your house at 5 in the morning, run to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people may die because of having to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bevelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
In comparison, the United States has one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they could afford to see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the health care spending in this country is private.
"Their only problem is poverty", said Bvellet.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his countrymen, Bvelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bvellet and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others pile into the vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs, and drive through the rough terrain to visit villages in need.
They don't always have the luck.
They had to push their cars through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: a celebration of song and dance and the finest facilities the locals have to offer.
The free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bjelle, with his wide smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to take in hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on each trip", Bvelle said.
They come from all over the county within a 40-mile radius of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these day-care centres provides a variety of healthcare services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get cribs, donated glasses, or free birth certificates or school-related documents that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
The surgery is usually performed in a school, a municipal building or at home; after the procedure, the patient stands up and walks to the post-operative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitary equipment, Bvelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's an unbearable pace, but the dedication of the band usually helps to support the village musicians.
"They beat the drums all night long to keep us awake and keep us working", said Bjelle.
On Sunday, the team members head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This team of doctors from Cameroon and international medical students have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can mean a lot to the people they help.
One man explained that his free operation to treat his hernia would enable him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family", the man said.
In addition to these clinical appointments on weekends and work at the hospital, surgeon Bvelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
This second work, he says, provides 60 percent of the funding for his nonprofit organization; the rest comes from private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping", said Kathy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, who volunteers with the Bvella group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that we can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe to join Buewell in his work, it's a practice opportunity they would never have had back home.
"We were able to assist in surgeries, where we helped remove blood stains or held instruments for Dr. Bwelle", O'Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medication.
But when they arrive in Yaoundé, it is Bvella who pays for their food, transportation, and education.
"He's a hero, without a doubt", said O'Malley.
He has devoted his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Blevelle, the almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is what brings him the greatest joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job", said Bevelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh, to make their pain less.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can do to help.
Snowden has agreed to testify about the wiretapping of Merkel.
Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebele has met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
The conversation focused on whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German attorney general in the case of the possible wiretapping of the German chancellor's phone by the US special services.
Snowden has expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, Hans-Christian Strebel said, that he knew a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, has blocked his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
But first we must determine the circumstances of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill that imposes additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Office of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, BELTA correspondent reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we agreed that the public administration bodies of the two countries will provide assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves", Vladimir Makei noted.
He stressed that the government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, and a protocol was signed.
The sides worked out a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the spheres of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as the search for new forms and directions of interaction.
"The protocol of the previous meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners", he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that the foreign ministers of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, should be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which should be further developed, as there is an untapped potential in this area, he believes.
Our countries have always had a very warm relationship, and we hope that it will be further strengthened and expanded.
All necessary conditions will also be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey", - noted Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama backs off on his health care talk.
Amidst the storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down from his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.
With hundreds of thousands of people getting service-discontinuance notices from their service providers, Republicans have in recent days criticized the president for misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original public promise.
"Most people with health insurance that works can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called "the news surge" in the shutdown, Obama urged Americans who receive such notifications to look for alternatives in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get better, more comprehensive health plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
"You will get more favorable terms", he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that the 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say directly to these Americans: You deserve better", Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been going "terribly" since October.
"I'm just as upset and angry as everyone else", she said.
I really want to earn your trust.
An angry Sibelius hurled the phrase, which was picked up on a microphone, at a backseat aide in yesterday's House of Representatives hearing after a heated debate with House of Representatives Bill Long, a Missouri Republican, about whether she should join Obama's health care program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily opt out of government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now forces on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt agency stripped of media status for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled that the license to register the agency "Rosbalt" was invalid, "Lenta" writes.
The agency was stripped of its media status by Roskomnadzor for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
The trial set an unpleasant precedent: the court found it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to raise counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"?
JSC "Rosbalt Information Agency" was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, "Rosbalt" has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was among the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement bodies.
The publication's close relationship to the security services has been discussed throughout the agency's existence.
In addition to the fact that "Rosbalt" had a large database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions spoke the fact that the head of the project was Natalia Chaplin - the wife of Victor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the management of "Rosbalt" is not entirely clear: most often she is called "the head of the project".
The agency's director general is Larisa Afonina, and the editor in chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Rosbalt has not been ranked by the federal media recently, not in terms of citation, not in terms of audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the ranking of visited sites of Russian media according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes on the Kremlin's impotence in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and joke", pogroms in the capital city of Biryulev.
The conflict between Roskomnadzor and Rosbalt began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law prohibited journalists from uttering uncensored profanity.
The agency found banned language in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers").
The sides describe the aftermath in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, based on the found footage, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the media law and asked the court to revoke the agency's license.
Rosbalt claimed that the claims of the agency were illegitimate: first, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The agency representatives appealed Roskomnadzor's claims to the world court - and when the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor's claim on October 22, 2013, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th, the world judge decided against Rosbalt: the chief editor Nikolay Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative offenses and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this was the outcome of the Mosgorsk trial - if you give up the idea that the outcome could have been decided even earlier.
On October 31, the court ruled that the Rosbalt registration certificate was invalid, effectively depriving the agency of its media status.
It's not like Rosbalt was alone in this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by the deputies of the State Duma (the application to the head of the Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CPRF).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov declared the publication's closure illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the Roskomnadzor leadership even gave him some guarantees that the case would not reach the revocation of the license.
The Rosbalt trial showed that the question of whose jurisdiction is safer for the media in Russia today is a big one.
Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria has destroyed all of its declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
Damascus has completed this first stage of disarmament a day ahead of schedule.
Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities designed to prepare weapons for use by November 1, BBC reports.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage.
The international inspectors went to Syria after a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 killed more than 1,400 people, according to the US.
The main objective of the inspectors was to keep the clock ticking - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munitions.
These facilities will now be monitored closely to prevent any damage.
The next milestone is mid-November, by which time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who's going to provide the equipment?
All Syrian claims will be carefully vetted by Western intelligence services.
They are willing to recommend new sites for inspection if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not being completely honest.
The U.S. believes this was a regular army fire.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia - destroy or put inoperative all facilities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and for filling shells with these substances.
Now that that's done, the next step is to destroy the chemical weapons that the Syrian army already has.
It is estimated that this arsenal may contain over 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisons, skin-numbing mustard gas, and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, the OPCW and the Syrian authorities need to agree on a timetable first - that's two weeks.
OPCW field operations director Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "were personally watching the destruction of the equipment".
"They have no ability to continue to manufacture or blend chemical weapons", he said.
The OPCW statement said inspectors visited 21 of 23 facilities in Syria and found that shell and poison plant facilities were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The other two sites are too dangerous to inspect, the document says, but the equipment has been moved and inspected by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the destruction of chemical weapons infrastructure was "particularly difficult" because it was necessary to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said the inspectors had no time to celebrate - they were too busy with their work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US espionage has gone "unreasonably far".
John Kerry has shown a softening of the defensive tactics of U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage has "gone the wrong way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "auto-pilot" during the emergence of Edward Snowden's high-profile exposés of NSA spying.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking by video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no doubt that the president and I, and other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things that were happening on autopilot, because that possibility already existed during World War II, and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, September 11th".
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far.
And the president is determined to shed some light on this issue and explain himself to the public, and is now conducting a thorough review to make sure no one feels abused.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Curry insisted, however, that the NSA acted in good faith and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is a radical extremism in the world, a reckless and determined to kill people, to blow up people and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and people being killed because we were able to know about these plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. spying abroad and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to quit anti-terrorism organizations because of frustration with the surveillance being conducted by the National Security Agency.
"It is really important to the national security interests of the United States that the Europeans remain our supporters in our joint counterterrorism efforts", said Democrat Murphy, who is in his first term and is the chairman of the Senate's International Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together on counterterrorism despite their anger over these NSA programs.
News that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe has soured relations with some US allies, though the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the US.
Other revelations have cited Snowden-leaked documents showing that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was common practice on both sides.
Amid the hype, Murphy said his office is organizing a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of other participating lawmakers should be announced in the coming days.
He said the itinerary is still being worked out.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of "hardness of the best" would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves have used over the years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
The new composition of the public oversight commission will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public observation commissions (ONC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the ballot measure passes, the law enforcement lobby will increase its influence.
The NCC is the public body that monitors the conditions of detention in prisons.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razzozdzayev, the unrest in the Kopeye colony - it is through the ONK that most of the resonant incidents behind the bars are publicized.
The fight for control of the ONK is between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the security forces.
At the meeting of the working group of the OP on the formation of the ONK, I proposed to make the experience of human rights work the selection criterion.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were formed without elaborating criteria", says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Observation Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - an all-Russian human rights organization that deals with prison problems.
As a member of the State Duma from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONK.
The OP Council has to vote for the composition of the National Council in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand people apply for the 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, the competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The PO is promising to organise a recruitment drive for vacancies.
The Moscow City Council is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, the current composition of the metropolitan commission is 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes to 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the Metropolitan Commission.
But the new composition may be re-entered by the representative of the "Battle Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He's been a member of the NCC for three years, but he's never visited a prisoner.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, having appointed their own chairman of the National Security Council, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by the ONK member Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of security agencies.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast", Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily. "I don't eat babies for breakfast, but I do eat them for breakfast", he said, adding that the baby was not eaten.
He denies lobbying for any lists to be moved and says he has no plans to prevent human rights activists from visiting arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list is now voted in the OP.
He considers the release of information by Borchkov a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk National Congress.
Its former leaders will be removed for last year's Copenhagen riots.
The public chamber concluded that the local commission's leadership had ignored the prisoners' concerns.
And the Rostov-on-Don UNHRC could go from human rights activists to law enforcement.
The new lists "missed" the human rights defender-chairman of the local commission, but one of his opponents was found, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions are considered by Borshchev to be "revenge for Kopeisk".
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the UNHRC of Mordovia, which is considered "strong": only one human rights defender wanted to be included in the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
OP council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list because he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The composition of the lists of the National Criminal Court was coordinated by the deputy secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Scientific Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not think it is right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the committee chairs have enough powers to impede the work of its members.
Grib doesn't bother to predict the outcome of the PO Council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of filing a false claim after the Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had attacked her on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Bamford was questioned by Phuket police for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
She was held in local police cells until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a general-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, not an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "very concerned" about their daughter's well-being and were waiting for her return to Australia.
"Obviously it was a very worrying time, but we hope she gets home safely as soon as possible", Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on 50,000 baht bail.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said Bamford is currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could see the court increase her sentence by up to two years and force her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to rebuild its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris for the presentation of his novel "Eltshevs", translated into French.
It is his novel that became a finalist for four awards: "Clear Field", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer was awarded the Russian Federation Government Prize in the field of culture for this book.
Roman Senchin is the undisputed leader of the generation of today's thirty- and forty-year-old novelists.
Almost every publication of his tough, built on the material of modern life stories and novels causes heated debates among critics of various trends.
It can be argued that the articles about Senchin's prose and publicity, the reviews of his books and the magazine publications put together create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the debates about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", in the words of the critic Sergei Chuprinin, the discussion is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature", what they see as the present and the future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow for the inclusion of most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviated form in the "Abzashi"... sections.
