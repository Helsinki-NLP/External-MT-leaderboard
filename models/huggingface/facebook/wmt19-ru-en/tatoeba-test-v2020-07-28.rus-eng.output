I'm getting angrier.
Do you have one more?
This is legitimate.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a flush in the toilet.
I rang the door.

What made you sad?
Right now, I'm too busy to talk to you.
The captain controls his ship and crew.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where did you put the screwdriver?
One-third of the prisoners escaped.
Praise be to Allah!
Do you think Tom knows?
This time I'm crying.
Tom behaved like a child.
Stop singing.
There were only six people at the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were a romantic.
I saw you spy on Tom.
I need you to do it now.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend is called Tom.
I'm afraid I have to confess something.
Tom was expected to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in hospital.
Don't forget to sign.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"Do you speak Greek?" - "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you persuade her?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We will try our best.
Would you buy one?
Tom will be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We sat at the very back of the auditorium.
You will survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He came expecting to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I would have bought it.
Have you ever seen this film?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is close to our school.
This is the biscuit I baked for you.
England is similar to Japan in many ways.
Tom would never have done that.
I suggest you try harder.
Nor will the barking of this dog frighten the child.
Don't resist.
Tom has the keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the mountains to cheer myself up.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do everything he wants.
Tom rarely tells us anecdotes.
Onions can be used in many dishes.
There is almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
A tree was struck by lightning.
Do you speak English?
My brother will kill me.
I opened the gate.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Will Tom go with you?
Where is the remote control?
I can't find it, either.
You will speak Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the phone down.
Tell Tom not to catch his eye.
We looked out the window but saw nothing.
Do you want to work with them?
The film was interesting.
I am exhausted. I work from morning to evening.
How much do we leave?
It's fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What will happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch a cold.
He took aim at the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Yes, you are!
I need to move on.
She pressed her nose against the glass.
The verbs ser and estar do not differ in English.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
It is very dangerous to text while driving.
Tom said that Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard off?
I want to get back to that house.
How many pens do you have?
The shaft of the forklift was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should tell me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We will have a few guests in the evening.
Her voice still rings in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All the men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss an opportunity.
Why don't we have dinner in a restaurant tonight?
Some birds did not fly.
What more do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
Did you look for it?
Did you not tell me that you had a brother?
Where can I wait for you?
I was really worried for you.
What did you find?
Can you explain this to me?
We were caught up in a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want one of them.
What do we have to lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never replied to his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm down the stairs.
It's the largest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to go back to work.
Tom told me that Mary doesn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done that.
What's the weather like there?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can't you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She burst into tears.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You are both idiots.
Do you like living in the countryside?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have what we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone shouted.
Which one is better?
We are grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
It wasn't me telling Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train departs at three thirty.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the animals from the cage.
He is afraid of cats.
You're like a father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone calls.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't get enough of your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much taller than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on the birth of his son.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas stepped away from the door.
My dad is an English teacher.
For Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bike.
Hold onto the railings.
Did you do that?
I would like you to translate this into French.
How many glasses are on the table?

Possibly.
I don't like Tom anymore.
Who is Tom with?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have a duty to help.
Tom has just been released from prison.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I've found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I have developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you would have done the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did it all.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom had already told me what I wanted to know.
Philosophy is the only way to use the vicious circle in proof and get credit for it.
I can't afford to have children.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they just stared at me. They never managed to get those boobs to understand their own language.
Should I go?
I was so stupid that I believed it.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I will open it.
It's been ten hours. My mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
Owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom is still out of a job.
We're perfect for each other.
French complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger is over.
We need more firewood.
Tom said Mary was irritated.
Let me know if you need any help.
We should get there before him.
He must be missing her.
He says he is not ill.
Paris far away?
What time is it in Tokyo right now?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim won't come today.
Become a father, you will understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there will be snow at Christmas this year?
How did Tom's party go?
I need to go to the toilet.
I borrowed a tent from a friend.
I will work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would have done.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
I have to pay all the bills.
She clapped.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom pulls Mary by the hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She is the laziest person I know.
Has Mary already cleaned up her room?
This time I will forgive him.
I love Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He is a sobriquet.
Alvaro is from Venezuela. He is Venezuelan.
Here's the bill.
He publicly insulted me.
Tom won't win again.
Why don't I stay with you?
In induction cookers, magnets are used to heat pots and pans directly.
I burst into tears.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombone.
Leave immediately.
Can I take a look at your rights?
I will charge you 1,000 pesetas to replace the zip on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom baked pancakes.
He dictated a few letters to his secretary.
Why would you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pyjamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He loves gardening.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave a note for Tom.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since halfway through the third.
He likes it that way.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Has anyone else noticed?
This sentence is not in English.
I think Tom is good.
She played a sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
The infection entered the bloodstream.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
One day you will thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still don't think very well.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until after 2am.
Maria had no thirst.
It wasn't as hard for Tom to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that this film is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we were late because of heavy rain.
She appears to be in good health.
Tom wore a straw hat.
Take care of your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to end.
Have you had dinner?
I love bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on a Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I have never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They are soiled.
I didn't know it was going to be impossible.
Have fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You frightened her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?
Does Tom know French?
He learned Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go into a beast.
It was compelling.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the newspaper on the table.
What did you learn?
Weather permitting, we will climb to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the Sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see it?
The more I thought about the problem, the more complicated it seemed.
His grey eyes gleamed and sparked, and his usually pale face livened up with blush.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take one more.
I'm looking for my passport. Did you see it?
His hands turned blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It is difficult for me to solve this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many houses.
This man was doomed to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me pick up your luggage.
Besides, I don't know how to dance.
I love you so much. I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to practice and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
No one is going to blame you.
I'm not busy at all right now.
Children like to play rather than learn.
He was mistaken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess which language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary is in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why call?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom is not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Is moustache suddenly fashionable?
Tom said he didn't want to waste so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom wears a pirate suit.
This is pure truth!
They went for a Christmas tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary had said.
Work is my passion.
Why wasn't I asked?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll bail you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She is his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me alone here.
I need to know everything.
We need taxis.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know that this man is who he claims to be?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald the Sinezootic, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There is nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like it?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
If only Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You cannot enter this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I would like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
Tom loves reading Hermann Hesse.
In truth, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases go to trial, it is customary for a jury to consist of twelve people.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very perplexed.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realised something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do it.
So another day has passed.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go for an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He was hurt when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, come on quick! We'll be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Do you keep an eye on your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
Forgive me for doubting you.
McDonald's is world famous for its burgers.
Tom gave Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock is broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Treat yourself to a biscuit, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it away, sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to go to Boston with us.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want as much as they can.
Tom works as a waiter.
It will be cold tonight.
She says she will wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was it too simple?
What Alice encountered as she waited for an answer was a sudden howl, loud enough to rupture her eardrums and loud enough to reach the heavens.
I lost it in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to give up his job.
You can't go there.
Tom helped Mary carry things in the car.
You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, huh?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You had to do your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
The stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why doesn't Tom sleep?
Both will be auctioned and will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tasted a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom fears.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I am learning is very complex.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I would be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Could you solve this question?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
The building has twenty floors.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
Are you, by any chance, unaware of when Tom returns?
I don't have photos of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
Will you give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
Had he followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait.
A strong wind picked up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try skydiving.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home in the evening?
The bag is empty.
Do you feel normal?
He's stubborn like a donkey.
I think you can be relied upon.
She knew she was wrong.
It's so cool!
Tom had a hunch that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but a girl picked up the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We must stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom what you called.
Tom is very strict with his children.
How are the negotiations proceeding?
He braced himself for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They complain forever.
Tom has small moustaches.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of scattered.
They didn't kill her.
I'd rather stay.
He came up with a brilliant idea.
She is currently resting.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe that everything is fine.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk in someone else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
Don't you know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough to eat.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's a leftie.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
He appears to be asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
How much do you want to leave?
Her legs were sore.
This is a risk that we cannot afford.
Can you take a moment? I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What is the square root of the two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Did Tom swim?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it will be opening time.
I'm not sure how big it is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and walked into the cave.
Who is your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do it.
She couldn't help but think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
We were crying with him.
Don't want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why did you dress like that?
Milk can be used to make butter, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who have dug a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself decently.
Do you like jazz?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Did you not know that Tom and Mary are John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked in response.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You will succeed if you try.
You didn't think to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say this in human language?
No one was hungry but me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in an avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I will solve this problem.
I told you that Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's time to spit.
I really liked the book.
You are important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay the night with her.
Tom did not tell the policeman his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
Everything was hurting me.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl was wearing a large red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was duped.
I called you here to ask a question.
Who will Tom play with?
I need a light coat.
I finished my assignment.
It's a cat.
Please tell me this is not true.
Don't you come in?
I repaired his radio.
This is a very bad idea.
Tom is taller than you.
Tom found work without difficulty.
Is this book in the public domain?
Could you please speak louder?
I'll tell Tom to get in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He's like a girl.
Please address me, no other way than Yakov Matveevich.
She is no longer alone.
Tom never admits that he is wrong, because he sees it as a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It took longer than I expected.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have a new Stevie Wonder album?
Can I stay with you? I was thrown out of my house because I didn't pay the rent.
Tell me where you went.
He stopped resisting and surrendered to fate.
It happened in Park Street.
Eduardo is younger than Roberto.
The Moon is Earth's satellite.
I don't know. Go to bed!
There is nothing useless about nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You are not my mother.
Tell them we're going.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
Tom should have been careful not to kiss Mary in public.
Will we help them?
Thank you for calling back.
They are happy.
Please don't be so harsh on me.

"Hello," Tom said timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in a lot of pain.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They run.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
On the attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to a meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?

Disappear.
Are you sure you want to do it?

They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.

Do you live there?
What would you eat?
Don't you recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do it or not.
I fall.
I wasn't able to turn up for his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom wears new shoes.
Last year, she learned to ride a bike.

Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with this?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
On the table is an open book.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about it.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic siren song to me.

He had cancer.
It is your own fault that it happened.
It is as accurate as a clock.
I know where you're going.
You grab everything on the fly.
Let's move it.
Let's leave it until tomorrow.

Today we will have to sleep on the street.
Did Tom show Mary how to do it?
Amazing, isn't it?

Do you think I would change my mind?
Tom is an Australian citizen.

Did you tell Tom?
Tom and Mary know each other very well.
You bought an expensive coat.
Scientists explain this differently.
What are you doing here?

Why?
This is my favorite project.
