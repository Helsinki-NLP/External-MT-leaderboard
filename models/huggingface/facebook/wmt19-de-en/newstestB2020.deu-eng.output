Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The fire at a chemical plant considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the Normandy Prefecture announced on Friday. The fire broke out during the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident, and the fire brigade deployed around 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Residents were told not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced at the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. Lubrizol is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when a leak in 2013 leaked the gas methanthiol and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system following an industrial accident.
Woman quits job to search for missing dog
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job for it. The seven-year-old border collie had run away from her hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days no trace of the dog was missing - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I felt sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going out for dinner. By the time they returned to the hotel Katie was gone. They searched for the animal, but to no avail.
Thunder had panicked dog
Hoping that Katie might still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The clerk says," She left about four or four and a half hours ago, "" Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic front door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Presumably, a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and appeals on Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard, but by the time King arrived Katie was already gone. She was searching the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled, according to Daily Inter Lake. "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her."
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear, with the opposition calling it "frightening."
Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition, according to a list of classified information provided by the Federal Ministry of Defense, which is reported on by the German Editorial Network.
According to the paper from the office of State Secretary of Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a weapon section and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have been recovered so far. Six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols are among the weapons and parts that are still missing. In addition, 30 gun barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.
The extent of losses of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr is "frightening," said Martina Renner, a member of the Left-wing Bundestag. This is all the more true because hardly anything has been recovered in the course of investigations. Renner spoke of a "poor record." Renner criticized that the list does not indicate whether the missing ammunition includes the one that was found in connection with the investigation of Franco A., a Federal Armed Forces officer suspected of terrorism. "And this despite the fact that a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possessing this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas today, Friday. Ship observation data from Refinitiv showed that the tanker set off and left the Iranian port, with Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates as its destination.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but remained in Iranian waters for the time being. The shipping company said that it wanted to await an official announcement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was launched on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off Gibraltar, which is part of Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime routes in the world, linking the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had risen immensely in recent months, with merchant shipping caught up in the conflict between the United States and Iran, and several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago in the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony held by the Thuringian CDU faction on the occasion of the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The horror of the state security was removed," she said.
Musk aims for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may be record-breaking, with the electric car group recently reporting losses despite a boom in deliveries.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a huge boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued, and the challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla would need to deploy as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter to do so.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with a plus of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, which will require six-figure figures in the current and coming quarters. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here, the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have recently been losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from being able to tickle themselves, scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin discovered with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children resist tickling so fiercely, only to then demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before touching it. This is due to a deep-lying layer in the cerebrum that triggers laughter even when expecting to tickle.
According to the researchers, previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasonic range when tickled by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves as the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
Until now, it had been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves. However, in experiments on the rats, the Berlin researchers found that laughing and the activity of the relevant region of the cerebral cortex were suppressed during self-touching, even when living beings cleaned themselves. However, during the foreign touching and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were increased.
However, if self-touching and touching by others happened at the same time, laughter was also suppressed, suggesting that the rat's brain could not distinguish between self-touching and touching by others. However, the new findings suggested that people could not tickle themselves because self-touching activated a brake in the cerebrum.
In addition, the rats were trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment, they sometimes interrupted this initiation prematurely, exhibiting flight behavior or rigidity. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Large fire at French chemical plant extinguished
The major fire at a chemical plant considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture told AFP news agency on Friday, after it broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances have leaked, and the samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident, and the fire brigade deployed around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens have been closed
Residents were told not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett's company Lubrizol
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. It is part of US billionaire Warren Buffett's Lubrizol company and is subject to the EU's so-called Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements, and employs around 400 people.
The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when a leak in 2013 leaked the gas methanthiol and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system following an industrial accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticised by own sister
The Prime Minister's sister was commenting on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of parliament since the compulsory recess was lifted on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without a deal unless Brussels agrees to his demands for changes to the Brexit deal. However, how he will achieve this is unclear.
Of Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to leave the EU." Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya in which 77 people died, a memorial to the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of around 1,000 iron replicas of roses, which commemorate the roses laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of Oslo Cathedral.
The project by the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsruhe is to be unveiled at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to attend the opening.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp run by the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers "Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate failed to resolve the Iran conflict, but now there is one less problem: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero," detained in Iran, has set sail again. It could be a piece of the jigsaw in Iranian President Rouhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero," which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being cleared by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said head of the shipping company Erik Hånell. Around noon the ship left Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Office in London described the detention of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with freedom of the seas and we are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards arrested the tanker on 19 July on charges of violating the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. Hånell said that the remaining 16 crew members were doing well under the circumstances, and that they had behaved professionally in view of the difficult and stressful situation over the past ten weeks. He said that the company was now working to reunite them with their families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected that the fixing of the "Stena Impero" was a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July, a supertanker carrying oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was tied up there. According to the authorities, the shipment violated EU sanctions against the war-torn country Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. London vehemently rejected speculation that it had been a barter to free the "Stena Impero."
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important maritime routes in the world, linking the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had risen immensely in recent months, with merchant shipping caught up in the conflict between the United States and Iran, and several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US single-handedly withdrew from the international nuclear agreement that was supposed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb while ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has pressured the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a tougher agreement that has been extended to other areas. Iran has so far resisted the pressure.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protectors.
India is building a better future for itself with its protectionist economic policies.
With US President Donald Trump imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are being forced to reschedule. CFO's of Asian firms considering moving production from China to another country have identified India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this has more than just to do with the vagaries of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems destined to play a more significant role in the globally diversified production chain.
But now India itself has come under Trump's spotlight. Dismissively dubbed "the kingdom of tariffs" by the White House, America withdrew trade concessions for 2,000 products from the emerging market in early June. America accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles, and more.
On the world map of trade wars, friction with India is, of course, merely a sideshow. Moreover, America views the world's largest democracy through the lens of security policy. Delhi and Washington are united by concern about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just assumed a second five-year term, is therefore likely to lull himself into safety.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is in a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India, even under Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has for too long stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in this multi-ethnic state. Companies are now obtaining building permits more quickly. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more tangible insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has changed for the better in India in the first five years of Modi. However, this is not true in trade policy. Inspired by the need to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the nationally conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi has the aura of an energetic reformer who is radically renewing his country's economy, not least because the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At its core, however, the "India First" advocate has never shied away from protectionist economic policies, which prevent Indian firms from being forced to abandon anachronistic practices to become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive by shutting off their industries are among the core voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Jacques Chirac's funeral to take place in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report, and the former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, AFP news agency reported, citing Chirac's family. A public funeral service was scheduled for Sunday in Paris "Invalides Cathedral, according to media reports.
Carried to the finish line: Dabo is the first unsung hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world's top athletes had already crossed the finish line by the time heart-warming scenes played out in the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium. Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to sway dangerously in the first heat of the men's 5,000m. He could barely keep his feet on the ground with over 300 metres to go, and was running in an unhealthy bent position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly caught him and dragged him to the finish line, supporting him for the last half-lap of the stadium. However, both still had enough strength to stop the watch running along with them after the finish. As if the scene wasn't strange enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he caught the attention of the gathered journalists completely unexpectedly. Shyly, he initially avoided talking about his feat at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best, and when he realized that this was going to be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer. Anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Championships by the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did so emphatically that evening - and much more intensely than he would have imagined, because this feat will be remembered, especially as Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead at the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this heats. In the end, it was all to no avail, because Busby, who only reached the finish with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Federation for exactly this reason.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best at the World Championships in Doha. According to official data, he managed to do so with 18: 10.87 minutes, but he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17: 55 minutes. I've been under 18 minutes before." However, only in training, so personal bests do not count.
Millions massacre: Egyptians gear up for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up ahead of possible anti-government protests. An increased police presence was observed in central Cairo on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed and roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already stepped up their street checks and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians in some cases for messages and photos relating to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, hundreds of people took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Egypt has not seen such an open protest against the political leadership in years. Egyptian property developer and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile in Spain, who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a "Million March" in central squares in the country today. Ali calls for a "people's revolution." For most young Egyptians, the man is not a "good man," because he made millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages are arriving.
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) reported more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday, while the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) said more than 2,000 arrests, although these figures could not be independently confirmed, and the government did not confirm or comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested" "just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported, citing lawyers for those arrested. Accusations against the detainees range from "spreading misinformation" to membership in a "terrorist organization," according to their lawyers. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniforms, but also in civilian clothes, also arbitrarily questioned and searched passers-by, according to HRW.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many parcels sent back are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has offered online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry explained in response to a question from the Green parliamentary group, which was reported by the newspapers of the Funke media group on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that every sixth parcel is returned to German citizens when they place orders on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. Donating them would, according to the current legal situation, also cost companies money, because the tax authorities rate donations in kind as a turnover, which then incurs value added tax.
Greens leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to issue a decree clarifying that companies can evaluate non-saleable products accordingly and donate them to non-profit organisations free of charge. Companies must be able to rely on not being penalised for donating, not only to online retailers, but also to other businesses from fashion stores to DIY stores.
Banksy art up for auction: There's never been a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of street art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament," is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world back to the basic attitude of animals and tribes." Starting on Saturday, the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at between 1.5 and 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the South West of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist re-exhibited the painting, coinciding with the original Brexit date of 29 March. On this occasion, the work, which was formerly called "Question Time," was renamed "Devolved Parliament."
The painting could change hands for millions.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson engaged in a fierce battle with the opposition at the first session of the House of Commons on Wednesday, after a compulsory recess imposed by Johnson was lifted by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out Brexit, which has already been postponed twice, on 31 October if necessary without a deal with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has intervened in the Brexit debate. In Dover, south-east England, he painted a picture of a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel, and thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors see the work every day as they enter the UK.
Brexit debate is like a 'walk in the park'
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fierce verbal attacks on anti-Brexit MPs do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings at a book launch on Friday. "We enjoy it. We will leave (the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had harshly attacked opponents of Brexit in Parliament in recent days, accusing them, among other things, of "betraying the people." He dismissed as a "humbug" accusations that he could thereby endanger MPs because they could, for example, be the target of death threats.
Cummings said the only way to restore calm was for MPs to finally respect the British people's decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that three years after the referendum, Britain has still not left the EU.
In view of the charged atmosphere, even the bishops of the Anglican Church appealed for restraint on Friday. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan PM Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
In his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan issued an emotional appeal to the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, another war between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said Friday at the United Nations General Debate in New York. "If things go badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers control one part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India withdrew its autonomy status from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby raising tensions with Pakistan abruptly.
Not even a bottle of water
Demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of Egyptian President el-Sisi.
The government is reacting to the current protests in Egypt with a tough hand, firing live ammunition at the population, and more than 2,000 detainees joining the 60,000 political prisoners already in prison. Protests have never been safe in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took power in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything it can to avoid a scenario similar to that of the Arab Spring.
But one of the reasons for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government drove millions onto the streets, and this is a problem that even el-Sisi's regime cannot get to grips with, no matter how hard it cracks down on adversaries, and the situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for repression, but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already the case before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv inspections in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital city airport
For two months, it was checked whether the complex system mesh in BER fire protection works together. Operators are satisfied with the process, but the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
Following extensive Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, said Rainer Bretschneider, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport CEO Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed audit, but also said there were still shortcomings to be worked through in the terminal. "We have many detailed issues, but we do not have a real showstopper." He assured that the timetable for commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should not be too large any more. Construction completion notices are now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables still need to be remedied; Tüv wants to check them by February. "In order to create the conditions here for the start of flight operations, intensive work must continue on dealing with the defects," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a matter of lack of evidence, rather than new cables. Furthermore, there is still no clearance for all dowels on which the cable paths are attached, which the airport manager expects to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection is not yet working satisfactorily at the crossing to the station below the terminal. Problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time, it concerns smoke aprons, which shut down like a screen in the event of a fire, so that the smoke does not spread. They shut down too far. 36 engines therefore need to be replaced, and there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction deficiencies as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was supposed to open in 2011. Since construction began in 2006, costs have risen from two billion euros to an estimated 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then, those responsible are planning the expansion of the airport. This is the subject of a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by Chairman Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. CFO Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Head of Human Resources Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on firm footing.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs busted - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for that he blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of detonated cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply, resulting in millions of dollars in damage!
Police apprehended a 33-year-old German man after two detonations at the end of May on Buergerstraße and Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik said: "In the course of investigations conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police into the production of explosives in a crime unit with a particularly serious case of theft, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, 33-year-old Chemnitzer has now confessed to a total of eight offences.
The police spokesman said: "He appears to have used the loot to finance his dependence on narcotics." The bomber blew up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstraße four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damages incurred amount to at least 60 000 Euros!
The bomber is now in custody and the police investigation into him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine blasts in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reshaping its strategy for Vienna International Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna," an Austrian Airlines spokesman confirmed to APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of Lufthansa's low-cost airline Eurowings will thus de facto be closed. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna, which AUA will take over as a "wetlease" from January 2020, i.e. including Eurowings staff. In future, three Eurowings jets will be based in Salzburg, which are to fly as charter aircraft to holiday destinations from Salzburg and Innsbruck. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Deutschland.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained. Flight times will be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other, to expand decentralised traffic from the federal states.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings in Vienna will only serve as a "production company" for its sister company AUA. Barcelona and Rome, for example, will be served with AUA flight numbers, but primarily with Eurowings equipment. Although the on-board product is to be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights starting with AUA flight numbers will no longer be handled in Terminal 1, but in the same way as AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki bankruptcy, a price war broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would increase its fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. To this end, the Irish low-cost airline is sending four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in a so-called "wetlease," which the union criticised as a circumvention of the collective agreement.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary's assertion that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years "time was countered on Friday by AUA CEO Andreas Otto:" We will remain the number one location in five, six or ten years "time."
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best of friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Great news from the British royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 34, is said to have held hands with his girlfriend Princess Beatrice, 31, while on holiday in Italy earlier this month, the palace announced on Thursday.
'We are extremely excited to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to embark on this adventure together and can't wait to actually be married, 'the couple, who have been together since October 2018 according to British media reports, said in the official statement.
He added: "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know it will help us a lot in the years to come, full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie, 29 - and posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is due to take place in 2020 and details of the date, location and everything else will be announced by the Palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the nuptials of the ninth in line to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be as big a celebration as Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank, 33, on October 12, 2018.
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, an unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic make-up of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genomes of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to get to the bottom of the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, announced the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. Switzerland's High Mountain Clinic Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease that can be influenced by genetic factors. However, the interplay between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known, it was said. Now, the scientists want to compare the complete genome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Cardiovascular Centre at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known, the clinic said. About 200 are added each year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart weakness and heart attacks, for example. Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Cardiovascular Center, said that the data could also be useful for research into other common diseases, and that new insights into the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney, as well as cancer, are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data for research into other diseases as well. So far, the foundation's clinic in Davos primarily treats allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he underwent open-heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and is very grateful.
The biopsies of the healthy participants come from people in Hamburg, who are also taking part in the Hamburg City Health Study. According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 subjects. Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich said that the protection of anonymised data is strictly observed in the decoding of genetic material.
According to UKE, the human genome can now be decoded within 24 hours at a cost of 1300 Euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million Euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. First results are expected the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still minors, according to police spokesman Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were mistreated, some of whom claimed to have been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, Sabo said, the protégés were detained by their teachers in "the most degrading and inhumane conditions." About a hundred students, including children as young as nine, were chained up in a small room.
According to the police, the Koran school had existed for around ten years, and residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities at the facility. Sabo said that parents were shocked when they were informed of the situation at the Koran school, and that they had no idea of the suffering of their children.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koranic schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have therefore fled over the border to the neighbouring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Police have rescued nearly 400 students from horrific conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries indicating torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the town of Kaduna.
The children were discovered at an Islamic school on Thursday after a tip-off that conditions there were "inhumane," and officers arrested the principal and six teachers after the rescue operation.
The children, all boys, were kept like slaves at their school and chained up. Some were sexually abused. Television pictures showed emaciated and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World football elections: More allegations after Messi and Klopp's freestyle
Football "Signature not valid"
Jurgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe honoured
With a gala in Milan, the world football federation Fifa awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi receives his sixth award and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world soccer elections, accusations are coming from other countries to Fifa. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reason.
Many things at Fifa have turned out to be questionable in recent years: the awarding of the World Cup, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa world football election has not yet been suspected of being unclean - with the exception of the fact that the voting national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote more for sympathy than for objective evaluation.
But after Nicaragua's captain complained that he had not voted at all, other inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. Indeed, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting summary.
Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the election forms were submitted in capital letters and were therefore not valid." The Egyptian FA has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach also baffled
While the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese FA states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote the way it was judged: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadio Mané in third. However, according to Fifa, the vote was received in the same way, with signatures and the official stamp of the Sudanese FA.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also made accusations: "Didn't vote for the # TheBest2019 Awards. All information on my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
From the federation came the message on Friday: True, but was of course not intentional. The completed election documents had been "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a communication of the federation. But actually the second captain Manuel Rosas had voted. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it was said in the communication. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa in an investigation, but stresses that the voting process was supervised externally by the consultancy PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Player of the Year award - and Jurgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Senior Republicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called for an official investigation into US President and fellow party member Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here will be determined by the facts that are established." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before any action is taken. An impeachment process can lead to the president's ouster.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyi in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said Trump had been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, but few have shown any unease about it. Scott's comments are now the first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate Virginia governor has repeatedly spoken out against Trump's policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.
Another senior Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, also spoke in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course of action and the responsibility of Congress now is to investigate and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of US states, have no formal say in the case against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, even first Republican senators have expressed criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that cracks are opening up internally among Republicans.
The affair could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, and House Democrats have announced an investigation into it, accusing him of abusing power for foreign influence for his own political gain.
There is no precise timetable for impeachment, and with their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could launch a so-called impeachment process, but the decision on actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans hold a majority, so the chances of such a process succeeding are slim. No US president has yet been impeached.
Were torturers on board Racket's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering people in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she sailed illegally to the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - including from Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy on the "Sea-Watch 3." The suspects were apprehended in a reception centre in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognised their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule it out, but we have no reliable information on this ourselves," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer to the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police said that the suspects in the North African country - Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24) - had been raped, tortured and even murdered. "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities, through repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said at the time.
"We can't scan who the people are, they come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. Therefore, it is quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated."
Italy's right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk aims for Tesla delivery record
Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a huge boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued, and the challenge was to get the cars to customers quickly, requiring Tesla to deploy as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with a plus of more than six percent. The price has not risen so strongly in almost four months. Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars in the second quarter, reaching its previous best.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, which will require six-figure figures in the current and coming quarters. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here, the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have recently been losses.
US budget dispute: Once again just bridge funding
The new fiscal year in the US will begin on October 1 without a proper budget. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and approved a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to raise spending limits for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States once again faces a new fiscal year starting on October 1 without spending plans. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and passed a Continuing Resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a resolution, there would have been a midnight shutdown on Monday, a partial federal government shutdown. President Trump has yet to enact the resolution.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal government is being financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019, which ends on Monday, because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and agencies. Therefore, the federal government cannot benefit for the time being from the increased spending envelope for the new fiscal year from $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve bills in the House of Representatives, where they hold a majority, but the spending bills reflect Democrats "priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely capable of gaining a majority.
Republicans in the Senate are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump's top priorities, while Democrats are interfering with the wall's construction plans and funding, which is supposed to go toward other military works and projects, and the dispute over the wall escalated in December 2018, leading to a 35-day shutdown.
The Ghosts Divide at the Wall
It is currently unclear how the parties will move forward on this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending bills over the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond November 21. Moreover, a shutdown is not out of the question.
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending bills in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity. Proposal p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically keep federal government funding at the previous year's level, stop lawmakers from traveling and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans are available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will in future also be open to single women and lesbians: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that would allow all women to have in vitro fertilization, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donation.
The bill still needs the approval of the Senate. Critics on the right had warned during three days of emotional debate that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Episcopal Conference is also opposed to the amendment.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the costs of artificial insemination for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilisation with sperm from dead husband still banned
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would have allowed widows access to their dead husband's sperm for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination is permitted "post-mortem." In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women appealed in vain for the return of a deceased man's sperm. Opponents of the move in Paris argued that a child conceived in this way would then bear a "particularly difficult fate."
Many members of President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party, La République en Marche (LREM), and members of the opposition had opposed artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be subjected to a "double grief" if her husband's death left her wish to have children unfulfilled.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that a widow may in future be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with the sperm of her own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination is only permitted in France for heterosexual couples who are unable to have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single people or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for air levy on universities grow louder
There is a lot of flying at universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax levied there in future. Rectors say they have no money for it, but now they are also coming under pressure internally.
Universities should also restrict themselves when flying. Photo: dpa / Julian Stratenschulte
Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the Green-Black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a pedagogical college are pleading for compensation for business flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, while at the same time there must be a broad debate about the avoidance of flights, according to their statement. Meanwhile, the cabinet decision, originally planned in July, remains on hold because the CDU has still not approved the Green Party's proposal.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB intelligence agency, those arrested are said to have been fishing illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested during an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew, in which three Russians and one North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. However, this time there were no casualties, it was reported.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, and North Korean fishermen have been sailing in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard says it patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 cuttlefish seized
During the renewed inspections, 30,000 cuttlefish were discovered and confiscated on the boats. Furthermore, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok, according to the information.
Russia's fisheries agency had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been detained there at times this year, according to media reports.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Primorye region, Georgi Martynov, also recently lamented the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with dense-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also take small creatures out of the sea. Moreover, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
Only 18,000 left: US lowers asylum cap
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, seen here meeting with elected officials at the White House.
The richest country in the world is closing itself off to asylum seekers: As confirmed by the State Department in Washington, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be lowered further. In the future, above all threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low threshold for receiving new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, according to the US State Department. In the now almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
In recent years, President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the acceptance rate for people seeking protection from around the world, while much higher admissions limits had been in place under the previous administration of Barack Obama.
The proposed cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was established in 1980, but the State Department called the US "the most compassionate and generous nation in history," a phrase strongly reminiscent of the current US president's language.
A "responsible approach" to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their countries of origin to help rebuild, Trump said, and his hard line on migration policy has drawn strong support from supporters, but also widespread criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. Trump declared a national emergency in order to finance the construction of a border wall. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selensky affair and a possible impeachment process.
According to the State Department, the US government intends to focus in future on taking in two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger as a result, according to the State Department statement. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, are to take in a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America, in particular, apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has concluded migration agreements first with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras in order to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, a female orangutan has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a reception centre for great apes in the USA. Sandra, who was born in Rostock Zoo in 1986, was granted the rights of a "non-human person," making her release compulsory. On Thursday evening, the animal was brought by direct flight to Dallas - not as a passenger, however, but in the hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Unable to adapt to life in the wild, the 53-kilogram great ape is to live in the open-air enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed there, among them "Bubbles," the former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving to Florida, "Sandra" will have to undergo a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process for "Sandras" fundamental rights, which was initiated by animal rights activists in 2014, helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park, where a research and education centre for the conservation of biodiversity is to be established by 2023.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
Extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new ride on the almost 3000 metre high Grosser Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550 metre high north face of the Grosser Zinne in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, a T-shirt and supported only by absolute freedom from vertigo, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, beating the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in free solo speed on four of the six major European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, Nike, the US sportswear manufacturer, has posted a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (just under 1.3 billion euros) in the quarter, 25 percent more than in the same period last year, the company announced on Tuesday, mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct," with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers directly online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three months to the end of August. Nike's sales grew the most strongly in China, up 22 percent. The company, based in Beaverton, Oregon, also benefited in the People's Republic of China from its approach of targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the sportswear manufacturer's "digital transformation" with strategic investments to expand its competitive edge. Investors reacted positively to the quarterly figures, with the sportswear manufacturer's shares rising more than five per cent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
The club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifetime stadium ban on a fan for racist comments about professional football player Juan Jesus from AS Rome. Brazilian defender Jesus had been berated by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then posted the private messages and called on his club to take action. "@ officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. # NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been with AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late on Thursday by reporting the fan's account to Instagram and the police, and the Roma supporter was banned from attending any of the club's matches again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist abuse against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved and this is very serious. It is necessary to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino had said at the weekend, following racist chants at the Premier League match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Torino recently. Italian authorities have now imposed stadium bans on 38 rioting fans of record-holder Juventus Torino. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police announced. Accordingly, bans of four to seven years apply to the rest.
The fans are linked to an ongoing investigation into 12 leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus, who are accused of serious extortion, money laundering and private violence, among other charges, which the club launched with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are behind the black market in tickets. They allegedly "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan circuit and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - entire cohorts are given catchy names. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitudes of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call, the crab fishing at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun officially started on September 21st, heralding the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of China's national environmental zones. It is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city is ecologically ideal with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water and 50 percent fields." Gaochun's magnificent natural surroundings offer its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started crab farming in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a formative industry, generating high incomes and becoming an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming, as well as technology-based crab farming, and the city has worked to promote greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers "incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has pushed ahead with a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services," and has carefully built the service network for "permits under one roof, a law enforcement team, a services network, a platform for lending," in order to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, services, and development.
Gaochun is taking full advantage of its links with southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, exploiting the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a showcase for smart high-end manufacturing, biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health sectors, and ecological agriculture leaders in the "3 + 2" sector. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, multi-territorial tourism zone and tourist resorts of national importance, integrating the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape, significantly improving the state of civic and civil service buildings, vigorously developing the "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" sectors, and advancing the development of high-quality cultural tourism. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Iran-US conflict: Rouhani speaks of end of sanctions, Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, upon his return from the UN General Assembly, has spoken of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, with the United States promising an end to all sanctions in exchange for talks with Tehran's leaders, Rouhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted his Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Rouhani described the situation as follows: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had pressed for a meeting to be held. "And America says I'm lifting the sanctions," Rouhani added. The type of punitive measures that should be ended was up for debate. "And they clearly said that we would lift all sanctions."
However, Rouhani criticised that this move had not taken place in an acceptable manner. In view of the current punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure," no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York, in light of Europeans "hopes to salvage the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope that Rouhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes struck western Turkey in a very short space of time, fears of a catastrophe are growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. Fears of a catastrophe are growing.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged as a result. On Thursday, the 5.8 magnitude earthquake had shaken the Marmara region outside Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Oktay announced that the government now wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future.
In the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly constructed residential buildings collapse - among other things made redundant by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that have been registered as shelters in the center have long since been built over. As recently as the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara, in the Silivri district, at a depth of about seven kilometres, according to Afad, the civil protection agency. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic in the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. TRT, the state broadcaster, showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were evacuated from buildings in Silivri district for safety reasons, and some students were crying, as can be seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake-prone. Below the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Fault, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 quake near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people lost their lives.
Researchers fear that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 to 7.4 could be imminent, but it is unclear when it will occur. Thursday's earthquake has already hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies are drawing up contingency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything needed are standing by front doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes. It is unclear when the next big quake will come.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured and that some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was following developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), which said two mosque minarets had collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings were shaking, schools and hospitals were evacuated, telephone lines were disrupted, and it was more violent than Tuesday's, writes one user. Kerem Klinik, head of the Turkish Red Crescent, warned via Twitter of aftershocks and called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is 1: 59 pm (local time). Just a few minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale, according to CNN Turkey.
Only on Tuesday an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it could be felt as far away as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis with millions of inhabitants, the civil protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake to make headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers believe that, sooner or later, there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy reckons that the earthquake is now a warning. This has made it more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later, the big quake will also come."
Already a few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In addition, there had been a violent earthquake in Albania just a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also trembled at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents have reignited the fire in the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. US Democrats feel emboldened on the path to possible impeachment: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president holds important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as the victim of a "witch hunt." He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
United Airlines passenger trapped in toilet - plane diverted
A United Airlines flight has been diverted because a female passenger was trapped in the on-board toilet and the toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to US media.
During an unscheduled stopover in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally freed from the cramped cabin, where she had been trapped for about an hour, US media reported, citing other passengers. Passengers had to change planes for the onward flight to San Francisco.
In a video circulated on the Internet, which according to US media is said to be from Flight 1554, several people can be seen trying to free the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman will receive compensation.
The Cockroach: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel inspired by Kafka
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Metamorphosis," the successful British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the chaos of Brexit in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams," who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but who is now suddenly the most powerful man in Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is fiercely determined not to let anything and nobody stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is shut down so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like Soviet leaders once did, if Brexiteers in high positions almost beg for the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." McEwan's novel "Machines Like Me" about Artificial Intelligence was published only in the spring.
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous vermin," is gradually excluded from family and society, and ultimately perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka in order to describe a world that is upside down," Diogenes Verlag said.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will be fitted with whisper brakes in order to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, with the funds coming from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility infrastructure fund.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips up to and including October 31, 2019, one day after filing for insolvency, citing "insolvency reasons," the company said on Thursday evening.
Bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid for or paid for in full, are also affected by this. However, the company left open the question as to the status of trips starting on 1 November 2019.
Thomas Cook in Germany was caught in the maelstrom of the British parent company's bankruptcy and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants hotels to repay money from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that currently accommodate Thomas Cook holidaymakers are to receive money from Zurich Insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are conditional on holidaymakers no longer being asked to make extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travellers are not immediately requested or otherwise coerced by these hotels to pay individual hotel bills," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who said they had been forced to pay for their own accommodation on site. Accordingly, some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized this.
The insurance spokesman said the number of hotels affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday. According to figures released on Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers were still on their way from Germany. Zurich Deutschland has insured the holidays and return trips of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the recently announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help those travellers who are currently on the road. Thomas Cook customers who are yet to fly on holiday are in a bad mood. Late on Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including 31 October would be cancelled, including those that have already been paid for.
The company left open the question as to the status of trips starting on 1 November 2019. It was reported that the further procedure would be examined in consultation with the insolvency insurance company. In principle, the Zurich insurance company is also responsible for these cases.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by Kaera. Customers can inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursing the travel price and submit their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys blast mine in Angola
Prince Harry has long followed in the footsteps of Lady Diana and is now following in his mother's footsteps in Africa.
Clad in a blue splinter-proof vest, Britain's Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico on Friday morning, he set off the ignition circuit in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same warlord who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to follow the path she was walking at the time. Princess Diana's images of her walking through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She, too, had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been together since Monday on a ten-day tour of Africa that began in the South African tourist capital Cape Town.
Stagnant Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that he would not allow the Brexit negotiations to be postponed for a third time, but what kind of statements will last forever for the polarising Briton? Britain's Supreme Court's recent ruling is hanging like a sword of Damocles over a blonde's head. His suspension of Parliament to allow him to stubbornly pursue his Brexit course until the date of withdrawal was annulled earlier this week, and a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend the bilateral talks until 31 October if negotiations with the EU fail. Johnson has categorically ruled this out time and again.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not appear to be going away for Johnson, who has since hinted during a visit to a hospital that he would support an extension of negotiations until the end of October if there was no agreement.
You know, we're going to abide by the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. There are still around six weeks for the EU and UK negotiators to prevent the UK leaving the European Union without a deal. However, even the most recent talks have failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October currently seems rather difficult to envisage. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the withdrawal date is in force. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. It fears that Johnson could somehow push through Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US agency: More e-cigarette deaths
The number of deaths linked to e-cigarette use in the United States has risen to twelve, and there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 cases, about 500 of which have been confirmed, and the cause of the lung damage is still unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been reported in Europe. Complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
Fears grow of new protests in Egypt
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared millions of times on online networks. In them, the Spanish-based property developer and actor calls for a "people's revolution." For today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass rallies with one million participants in central squares of the country.
At any rate, the security authorities are alarmed. In central Cairo, an increased police presence could already be observed. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were closed. Already in recent days, the police had strengthened their street checks and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for messages and photos related to the protests.
Protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square on September 20.
Last weekend, hundreds of people took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. Such an open protest had not been seen in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted harshly to it. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week, many of whom have been arbitrarily arrested simply because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW reported, citing lawyers for those arrested.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi, who has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox returns from Greenland expedition
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his expedition to Greenland on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed by, among others, the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic on the racing yacht "Malizia."
In recent months Fuchs and a team of scientists had been studying and documenting the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak out. It had been known for decades that the earth was warming. Nevertheless, many people acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often takes place behind closed doors," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the oceans. During the expedition, Greenland glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished for microplastics with nets, among other things, it was reported.
The polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "fight for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "Arved Fuchs is a great role model for all of us who care about the survival of the oceans," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: that seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the bill, which included an 80 euro tip, was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, causing heated reactions.
"Cases such as these damage Rome's reputation, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Tourist Guides in Rome, said, according to Rome's Il Messaggero newspaper (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came immediately. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be found in the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
A phone call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump may indeed face impeachment after the tumultuous revelations of the past few days, the Democrats now want to examine this as quickly as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - there is talk of weeks until a decision would be made.
The scandal allegedly began with a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The whistleblower's complaint, which ultimately brought the conversation to light out of concern for national security and US democracy, is monstrous: the president abused the power of his office in order to use the government of another country to influence the 2020 election. He used Ukraine's dependence to blackmail him, thereby forcing him to take action against a political opponent.
The nub of the matter can also be seen in the now-released transcript of the conversation with Selensky, though it does not reproduce the full text. However, the July 25 phone call is just one episode in a much larger story that centers on Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins, from a public perspective, in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows full well that his intentions are delicate. "We're not interfering in an election, we're interfering in an investigation, which we have the right to do," he tells the newspaper. You might think it's inappropriate, but "there's nothing illegal about it." Giuliani wants an investigation in Ukraine for which there's little basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor appears to have become infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, in order to build a case for the Russia investigation in the US, an allegation that was never taken seriously.
This is the very investigation that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Selensky in July. Giuliani and the president's version is that Joe Biden, the former vice president and now a likely candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, pushed for the dismissal of then-Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin as the Obama administration's Ukraine envoy in order to stop his investigation into the gas company that his son Hunter Biden served on the board of directors of. Biden senior allegedly blackmailed Ukraine financially to cover up his family's corrupt dealings.
When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general leave, the investigation into the gas company was already complete, and Hunter Biden was never directly involved in it. Moreover, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt conduct, and the US government was far from the only Western partner to press for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp disruptions: Social media are down
Users worldwide are reporting massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, primarily Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has repeatedly failed to load since around 3.30 p.m.. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also appears to be affected by the malfunction, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. hit by disruption
This is not the first major incident this year, as services were disrupted for several hours in March and July, and as in previous cases, users are turning to Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force. They were travelling in an inflatable dinghy and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky - it took less than an hour for the Chilean rescue helicopter to recover them.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"We received the news at 9: 30 a.m., we left shortly before 10 a.m., and a good 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy."
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there, and the frozen explorers safely returned to their research station.
Attention: NEVER charge your smartphone wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently appeared on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models - we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommendable.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones, which, according to the findings of the University of Warwick, is extremely harmful to the devices, due to the significantly greater heat generation. If a mobile phone is charged normally via cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In wireless charging, on the other hand, even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned with the charging pad, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad increases, which in turn increases power consumption.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries, and every single degree plays a role in this. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last as long overall. Thus, the service life is shorter. Therefore, the researchers advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. As battery replacement with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of a battery replacement - for all iPhones.

The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery can be charged without the tedious clutter of cables and laborious plug fiddling. As Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer) is a global standard that even Apple is exceptionally involved in, there are hardly any restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 8,000-metre peaks in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer says he has climbed 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organiser said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 8,000-metre peaks in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible." He has made international headlines before: in the spring, a photo of climbers standing in line on Mount Everest went viral.
The image of the mass stampede sparked a debate about tighter security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and the world's tallest peak. In May, 11 climbers died in a matter of days while climbing it.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th 8,000-metre peak: Chinese authorities are currently closing Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet, citing bad weather as one of the reasons. Earlier this week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow him to climb.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
A pregnant elephant cow was among the dead animals, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and popular former rock fortress of Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. Often, the perpetrators are farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals roam through villages built near their habitat.
According to estimates, there are only about 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka. Killing them is theoretically punishable by death.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after being detained by Iran, the Maritime Authority of Bandar Abbas announced, according to the IRNA news agency. Iran's Revolutionary Guards arrested the British-flagged tanker on July 19, accusing it of violating the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook management criticised
The House of Commons Economic Affairs Committee is to hold a full inquiry into the collapse of travel giant Thomas Cook, looking at the pay packets of its board and why the UK government did not intervene financially to help the struggling company. "We are interested in oversight within the company as well as external auditors," said Rachel Reeves, chairman of the committee, in London. "It appears that we are dealing with a terrible example of management greed."
Experts say genes are overestimated in bowel cancer risk
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of colorectal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion reached by researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as familial eating habits probably weigh more heavily than previously thought, which has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
This is what Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek." Demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued.
The challenge, he said, is to get the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla will need to deploy as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter to do so.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with a plus of more than six percent. The price has not risen this much in almost four months. Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars in the second quarter, reaching its previous best.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars, which will require six-figure figures in the current and coming quarters. In particular, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here, the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have recently been losses.
Will UK government bypass Brexit law? Johnson cautious
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has remained tight-lipped about whether he is looking at ways to circumvent the law passed by parliament last year against an unregulated Brexit, saying only to reporters on Friday that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political chicanery" to circumvent the law, using a procedural ploy to delay the law's entry into force until after Britain leaves the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran apparently ramps up uranium enrichment
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has stepped up pressure on European partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are showing incompetence or unwillingness to take concrete action," Rouhani said Thursday at a news conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. If they do not fulfill their promises, he promised "further steps" away from what was agreed in the painstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background to this is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atomic bomb, which included a commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations in return. In 2018, the US single-handedly withdrew from the agreement in order to force Iran to change course in what was seen as an aggressive Middle East policy with "maximum pressure." President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now relying on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded by resuming uranium enrichment, which is limited under the agreement.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using, or at least preparing for, the uranium centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are unwilling to play their part in the deal, leaving the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of burdensome US sanctions, Rouhani surmised. Nevertheless, there will be further talks that will hopefully bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed following an attack on an important oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Monday followed the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had claimed responsibility for the attack, but this was interpreted by the US as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rouhani reiterated his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide proof of it," Rouhani said. However, European leaders would not have been able to do so in their talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have merely relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration's far-reaching sanctions must first be lifted, Rouhani demanded, calling on the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet crossed by other star in solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, but this has only been possible once before. It allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially just a guess has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing through our solar system. The comet from deep space was christened 2I / Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-travelled comet was discovered on 30 August by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov at the Margo Observatory in the Crimea - with a home-made telescope measuring 65 centimetres in diameter. Follow-up observations by various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not come from our solar system.
After 1I / 'Oumuamua in 2017, 2I / Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be spotted during a flight through our solar system.
2I / Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get a close-up view of an alien solar system before it disappears for ever. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun," Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa said in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbelly orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar comet, which was initially listed under catalog number C / 2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I / Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I / 'Oumuamua, 2I / Borisov has already been spotted on approach, leaving researchers many months to investigate. "The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already set their sights on the comet. Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who led the characterization of 1I / 'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers in an initial study. Images taken by the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Institute of Astrophysical Sciences of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar comet, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new path for the study of certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such visits are. A planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa could possibly intercept one of the next interstellar visitors.
The agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it should either lurk for a still untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor such as 1I / 'Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new Daxing mega-airport
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers a year by 2022, rising to 72 million in 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion dollar project. China's latest prestigious project is also known as "starfish" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automated air traffic management system, with a new subway transporting passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. Until now, the opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and is much smaller - has been repeatedly postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger plane landed after only four years.
New supersonic plane to fly from London to Sydney in four-and-a-half hours by 2030
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that's what the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of. A special Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (Sabre), developed by Oxfordshire-based Reaction Engines, is intended to make this supersonic flight possible in the 2030s, US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying. "This is the technology that could definitely do this," agency boss Graham Turnock told the station. "We're talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and work is already well advanced."
To advance the project, the British space agency plans to work more closely with Australia. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic passenger aircraft to date, Concorde covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until it ceased operations in 2003, taking between three and three-and-a-half hours. In 2000, a Concorde took off from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, killing all 109 people on board. Last year, US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to work with US space agency Nasa to develop a supersonic plane, the "X-Plane." Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its website, among other things. Sabre's propulsion could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - five times the speed of sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, enabling the "next generation of truly reusable framing equipment."
Turmoil in Washington as Trump seeks to track down anonymous whistleblower in Ukraine affair
Donald Trump wants to uncover potential leaks in the White House in the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday, saying the person involved was almost "a spy" and had been treated "a little differently" in the past than he is today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate donors, and the event was not actually public, but several US media outlets broadcast audio of the speech on Friday, and Democrats reacted angrily to the president's statement.
Democrats in the US House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their accusations are based mainly on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence agent who is making serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under great public pressure, the whistleblower's accounts were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 US election.
At the center of the allegations is a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate what could be damaging to his political rival Joe Biden, about Biden's son Hunter's past business dealings in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is leading the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of a cover-up with regard to the Ukraine phone call: senior administration officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under wraps. As usual, an electronic transcript of the conversation had been made. However, after the conversation had been ordered by White House lawyers, this had been removed from a database normally provided for this purpose and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough transcript of the conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and The New York Times reported that the whistleblower was believed to be a member of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Trump on Friday again questioned the credibility of the source, saying in a series of tweets on the subject that the "so-called whistleblower" had leaked second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate, so there may be no whistleblowers or spies.
But Trump's comments in New York about those alleged to have leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responding with alarm, complaining that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
Various investigations into Trump and his entourage have been underway in various committees in the House of Representatives for months. Faced with the Ukraine allegations, Democrats are now pushing ahead with new vigor with investigations in order to initiate possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accusing him of misrepresenting things, and again calling for the committee's chairman to resign. Trump regularly berates Schiff and had demanded his resignation months ago.
More than 300 former US security and foreign policy officials, most of whom worked under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democrats' investigation into possible impeachment in a statement released on Friday, saying that if the allegations are true, it would be "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump.
With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could initiate an impeachment process, but the decision on actual impeachment would fall in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans hold a majority, so the chances of such a process succeeding are slim. So far, no US president has been impeached.
VW works council: Jobs are being cut "creeping"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the automaker, which wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
The "Future Pact," negotiated in 2016 between the company and the works council, already provides for the elimination of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be cut at the automaker if it is virtually proved that the activities associated with it are no longer necessary. Furthermore, job security is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, jobs in production that are not actually up for grabs are being "stealthily" cut by another route - that is, by bypassing the official rate. Frequently, regular positions that become vacant would not be refilled.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the reoccupation. Meanwhile, there is a lack of staff in many places, the concentration of work is increasing, and concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants are growing. Thus, the fear is growing that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said only: "An adjustment of the employment volume takes place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more globally and control new projects centrally, which is also intended to reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the goal behind this is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann, CEO of Production, said at a management conference in Berlin: "Particularly in uncertain times, from Brexit to the imminent trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
There are already successes along this path: this year, for example, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle will fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be shortened by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures for the production period; according to our newspaper, the production time for the Golf 7 is around
20 hours.
In our region, the parent plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. In Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies internally to VW that 800,000 cars must be built there each year for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. However, in 2018, the capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust gas testing method WLTP.
As Chief Production Officer Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg "in the future." This should make it possible to bundle the Golf production at the parent plant - because the Zwickau plant will hand over the Golf production due to the conversion to a location for electric car production.
In addition, the Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs are produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of the Golf and Tiguan have recently declined, so expectations are now resting on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to develop e-mobility, it is to remain the bread-and-butter car for the Wolfsburg-based company for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: traffickers sentenced
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, for which six alleged traffickers must go to prison.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to suspended sentences and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months. The accused smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerians who wanted to leave the country had to take a ritual oath before a voodoo priest back home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old and were brought across the Mediterranean in rubber dinghies with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed among various brothels in order to work off the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Therefore, their wages were completely taken away from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted smuggling the young Nigerian women and then distributing them to brothels during the trial. "The work was physically and psychologically difficult for the women," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the sentencing. "Some were really disgusted."
The sentences relate to the commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, pimping and serious forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants "union Ufo has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the bargaining table, the union will "inform on 14 October about the industrial action in the LH Group," UFO Collective Bargaining Board member Daniel Flohr announced on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to engage in collective bargaining with the UFO for months, including the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective bargaining agreements at Lufthansa.
Following a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court, UFO now sees itself strengthened in this regard. Lufthansa wanted to let it be known that the collective bargaining agreements had not been terminated, and the court rejected the applications. UFO confirmed the decision and is considering appealing against it. "I think it is unlikely that a second court will take a completely different view of the matter," said UFO Executive Board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Higher Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the UFO's status as a union reviewed in court, arguing that the union had not appointed a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the Divisional Union, in the course of which numerous members of the Executive Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including the long-time union boss Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the UFO had suspended a vote on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings that had already begun at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is about to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia aims to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it aims to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the tourism commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the tourism commission.
Saudi Arabia is currently difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually issued only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visits with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes to generate more revenue from the tourism business. Riyadh says it wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oilfield. As a result, national oil production plummeted and oil prices soared. It is likely to take several weeks for the kingdom's oil production to return to its old levels.
Justin and Hailey Bieber get stuck in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber, 25, and his wife Hailey, 22, are gearing up for their nuptials, with the model posting several party photos to her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in a white wedding dress. According to People magazine, reality star Kendall Jenner, 23, and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful outfits on Instagram, including a banana-print suit, asking his followers: 'Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding.'
The Biebers tied the knot in a New York registry office a year ago, but there had been no major celebration back then.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey explained that the two had found common ground after initial problems: 'If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship.'
Two dead in Czech plane crash
Two people have died in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a wooded area near the town of Mecin (Mečin), the police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the plane since Thursday evening, after the crew had sent a distress signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also used in the search, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. It is located about 30 kilometers south of Plzen and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species at risk of extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also the causes of the threat, the World Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the populations of all 454 tree species known in Europe, of which 265 are not found on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of threat and thus on the verge of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered," "critically endangered," "critically endangered" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct." In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
Rowan and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, rowan (sorbus) are particularly threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or due to the conversion or weakening of their habitats."
The situation is also bad for the wild horse chestnuts, which have been classified as "vulnerable" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. Besides a fungus, the greatest threat is the Balkan miner moth. It has been spreading from southeastern Europe to the entire continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates that there are fewer than 10,000 wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe. This assessment does not include trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Shrub species and mosses also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. According to the IUCN, more than a fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails play a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Istanbul earthquake: 34 injured reported
Thirty-four people were injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the data, there were no fatalities. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, and 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged and there have been almost 200 aftershocks since the previous day's quake. Thursday's 5.8-magnitude earthquake shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Oktay announced that the government now wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said that Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Below the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most powerful quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was at that time in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
A 4.6-magnitude quake struck the Istanbul region on Tuesday, and authorities urged residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform at halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show at next year's American Football Super Bowl, the singers announced on Twitter. "It couldn't get any bigger," Shakira wrote alongside a photo of herself and Lopez. She's so excited to be on the Super Bowl stage, which will take place in Miami on February 2, 2020.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She said she couldn't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world."
Shakira said in a statement that she was honored to be standing next to another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the US and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time the two "queens" were on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audience figures
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV shows in the USA. Even if you have been watching them recently, this February the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been uproar in the run-up to last year's Super Bowl halftime show: According to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B. After all, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - and the reviews were not kind.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had taken a knee during the national anthem before NFL games in the 2016 / 17 season in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick's protest sparked a movement and numerous players took the gesture. It caused a great stir, with US President Donald Trump sharply attacking the mostly African-American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been without a club since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks dearly. There is the threat of large write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its Friday edition.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse are likely to have to take write-downs of up to 1.8 billion pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, the report said, according to estimates by the consultancy AlixPartners.
Bondholders would have to take write-downs of between £900m and £1bn and lenders between £550m and £825m, with actual write-downs likely to be at the upper end of the ranges, one expert told the paper.
It remains to be seen how big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end, after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to the proceedings did not radiate too much hope. Thus, for example, the approximately 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad locations. It was further said that the most money could probably be made from the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand.
Racketeer allegedly took alleged killers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are alleged to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we have no reliable information on this ourselves," Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman for the refugee organization Sea Watch, told the dpa news agency.
Other migrants have recognized the three men in Italy, accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception center in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that refugee organizations could not verify who they let on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, ramming an Italian financial police vessel. On that day, the three suspects are also said to have arrived in Lampedusa. The captain is under investigation for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
US warns federal government over Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust Chinese network equipment supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great, "Pai told Handelsblatt, referring to the roll-out of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from security agencies.
Current law also prohibits companies from notifying third parties of such requests, "the FCC chief added, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the German government has agreed to require suppliers to declare their "trustworthiness."
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt," citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
It is precisely the software that is important to keep the devices up-to-date, which consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time, "Pai said.
It is "very hard to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to verify every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief added.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure is opaque, and the employee company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government, "Pai told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
The United States has knowledge that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in northern France on fire: Schools closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A giant wall of fire lights up the sky above a chemical plant in northern France. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up could take days.
Schools and nurseries in the region remain closed after a fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precautionary measure, the responsible prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals indoors, to protect their feed and to stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, according to the prefecture, which said on Twitter that there was still a risk of smells spreading after the extinguishing. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 policemen and gendarmes were deployed at the scene of the fire.
A giant column of black smoke had risen from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol factory, which makes additives for oils, located a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are subject to special surveillance. In 1976, there was a devastating chemical accident in Seveso, near Milan, Italy.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples at first, but pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. Dams had been built in the river to combat the pollution, the prefecture said.
The fire broke out in the early morning around 2: 40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French finance minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest, and the sooner the better, "Le Maire said on Thursday evening as France unveiled its budget for next year.
The eurozone economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We cannot wait for the economic situation to get worse in order to take the necessary decisions. "
Those states that had budgetary room for manoeuvre for more investment had to act, Le Maire said, partly with a view to Germany.
France does not have this room for manoeuvre, the minister added, referring to the high public debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced," said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020, unveiled on Thursday, provides tax breaks of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is reacting to the protests of the Yellow Vest Movement. New debt is to fall to 2.2 percent, after an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick us?: Johnson dodges question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the "surrender law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, and a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a messy Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still exploit a loophole. However, when asked about this possibility, the Tory politician dodges.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains tight-lipped about whether he will push through an unregulated Brexit - despite the recent legislation passed by parliament to prevent just that - but when asked by reporters, Johnson said only that his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "surrender law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, and that the prime minister could use a procedural ploy to delay the law's entry into force until after Britain leaves the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he found the political wrangling over Brexit a "walk in the park" and expressed confidence that the desired exit from the EU would still happen: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave the EU, don't worry," Cummings said at a book launch, according to Britain's Telegraph newspaper.
Cummings, who led the Vote Leave Brexit campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now chief strategist at Downing Street, the UK's government headquarters, and is said to be behind the hard-line policies that have left the PM in a virtual impasse.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin have all been photographed by Linda McCartney, who has become one of the greatest rock photographers of all time, but it doesn't always have to be glamour. "The Polaroid Diaries" (Bags) delves deeply into the private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Prominent guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event McCartney wrote on Instagram: "# ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary pre-Instagram family, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film."
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, always had the camera with her. She has done thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries."
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And, of course, there is always one in the center of attention: her husband Paul - as he may never have been seen before.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, talks on the phone in a bathrobe with a bag on his head, or wears misshapen moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also led a normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or Scotland. Mary McCartney, for example, told the BBC that as a baby she slept in a bed made by her father from old potato boxes, and it hasn't always been tidy up with the McCartneys.
The Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment like no other medium. Linda McCartney's photographs are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's all about the click: you have to recognize when a great photo is happening in front of you, and then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment, "said Paul McCartney." If you snap it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo. "And Linda would have had the gift of capturing just the right moment all the time." She just knew she had it, "Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the detail and the colors are right, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to all the anecdotal aspects, where landscapes sometimes seem like abstract paintings. It's the perfect complement to the just re-released Beatles album "Abbey Road," which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighboring country despite U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot cut off oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there, "Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan acknowledged, however, that Turkey was having problems importing Iranian oil because some companies had "withdrawn" because of U.S. threats.
Nevertheless, "especially on this issue and on many other issues, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran," said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear programme and is not adhering to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to a slump in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably in recent months.
US government wants to restrict refugee admissions
The US government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The US State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the United States remains committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The US government intends to focus in future on accommodating two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger as a result, according to the State Department statement. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, on the other hand, are expected to accept a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
Launched in 1980, the program selects refugees from U.N. camps around the world and resettles them in the U.S. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program's history. Already, the current cap of 30,000 is a record low. By the time President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number stood at just under 85,000.
Aid agencies reacted with horror to the announced lowering of the cap. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, adding that the US would further damage its leadership role in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration to the United States, both legally and illegally, and the administration says it expects to receive 350,000 asylum applications in the coming fiscal year, figures that are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Comes Close to a Spy"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever hacked into the whistleblower accusing him of abuse of power "comes close to being a spy," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday, according to multiple US media reports.
When asked about the person who briefed the whistleblower on controversial matters in the White House, Trump replied, "It's like a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with it a bit differently than we do now."
Observers interpreted the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. Democrats sharply criticized Trump's remarks, accusing him of intimidating witnesses, and it was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into possible impeachment proceedings against him, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees wrote.
In a newly published complaint, the whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to ask for interference by another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it relates to his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyi in the summer: In the conversation, Trump urged him to launch an investigation into his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is said to be a CIA foreign intelligence analyst.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Again and again, people try to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. In the process, the often too small boats capsize regularly. Seven migrants have now died in the sinking of an inflatable boat - including five children.
Seven migrants have died in the sinking of a rubber dinghy off the Greek island of Chios. A baby and four other children were among the victims, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
According to Alithia.gr., the local news portal of Chios, one of the victims was said to be a smuggler. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants originate. Currently, hundreds of migrants cross from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people lost their lives on this route.
The Who cancel concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of an indisposition of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston his voice failed. On the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it is still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey "really can't talk right now." Townsend promised the audience that he would get his money's worth at a reparation concert, but a date has not yet been set.
Daltrey, 75, and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members of The Who, a British cult band formed 55 years ago. Daltrey, 75, and Townsend, 74, are the only remaining members of the band.
Hiring suddenly stopped: WeWork sends real estate markets jittering
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork rose from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. Now, however, the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to upset the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company removed founder Adam Neumann as CEO, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as a private jet to executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, the British Financial Times reports that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect, making it the largest tenant of office space in New York and London, among others, suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office space on a long-term basis and rents it out in small units to members on a short-term basis. These can be individual freelancers, small start-ups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking rate. Last year, the company made a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the rental costs alone are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by renting ever new large spaces. In order to limit the loss, the new management is now said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in more than $40 billion in liabilities, which could become a problem not only for the company and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork has leased almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new space that came on the market during this period. Without WeWork's expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this period, as Alpert wrote in Business Insider. Similarly, the situation in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in prime locations.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, which was purchased last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for just under 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions of income. They do not have access to the - anyway scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term lease agreements, because the rental of the individual WeWork locations is usually carried out by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia Again Detains Numerous North Korean Fishermen
The Russian coast guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested for illegally fishing in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the Interfax agency on Friday.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested after firing on the border guards and injuring three of them. No one was injured this time, it was reported. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard says it is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources, and 30,000 cuttlefish were discovered during the new inspections, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok, according to the Ria Novosti news agency.
Russia's fisheries agency had not issued fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, and thousands of North Korean fishermen have been detained there, according to media reports.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Primorye region, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained about the high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen, who fished with dense-meshed synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia and which also take small creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets are simply disposed of in the sea, where they take 200 years to decompose, and the vessels themselves do not comply with hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the previous week's arrests, and a North Korean, also wounded, later died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On that September 17, Russian border guards detained a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
US imposes travel ban on ex-President Castro
The United States has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, citing Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations," the State Department said in a statement on Thursday. As head of the Caribbean nation's Communist Party, he presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily detained and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by propping up Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro. "The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and use of force to prop up the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed travel bans on members of the Venezuelan government and military, among others. Venezuela has been embroiled in a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The United States has imposed a raft of sanctions against Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and bring opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies, and the socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress opponents of the government.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international week of climate strikes, the movement Fridays for Future is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world, starting with New Zealand and Australia due to the time difference, before spreading across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how big the worldwide support for this Friday will be after the record turnout of the previous week. Thunberg herself was in good spirits. "Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday, we will do it again!," she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the week of strikes, she added.
According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all demonstrators worldwide - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list provided by the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities, including major cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, where people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat down in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on politicians in her country to do more to combat climate change, which in a short time gave rise to the Fridays for Future movement. Schools and students, but increasingly scientists and other adults are taking part in the climate protests.
Together, they are calling on politicians to be more ambitious in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York less than a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise on a high-seas racing yacht, where she had most recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she addressed the world leaders in a powerful conscience. In her native Stockholm on Wednesday, she had been awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation for her commitment to climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on balconies
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on balconies, according to a change in fire safety. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Emergency Ministry said on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass news agency. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke, however, face a fine of 3,000 roubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette ignites a fire, the penalty is higher. Likewise, according to the ministry, burning candles are prohibited, and barbecuing meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Blow to cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time unearthed a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites through which international criminals operated their activities as operators of a data centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle.
This was announced by the Attorney General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major operation. Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have included the operators of the world's second-largest drug darknet marketplace, Wall Street Market, which investigators smashed in the spring. According to the Attorney General's Office, the attack on 1.25 million telecommunications routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the Cyberbunker.
It was said that such a hoster had been dug up for the first time in Germany. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation with the support of special forces such as the GSG9 there were searches in Germany and neighboring foreign countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international week of climate strikes, the movement Fridays for Future again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including major cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to take part in a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests: Who are Thunberg's backers?
Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that are warming the climate. So it is all the more surprising that a 16-year-old girl of all people holds a mirror up to the people in power of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing by a climate activist? Historical masterstroke or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and gets young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to work for a more just world. At that time, he was able to win over a crowd of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea in order to reach the Promised Land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently made the journey to America with a sailing boat.
But is there a downside to this? Why does it take a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. Besides, her mother has published a book, which has sold well, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also, well-proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick for some of her successors. This is not unfounded, because the action was very well received in the media worldwide and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
This is where the minds are divided: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially while saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people cooperate with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? No matter which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question even seemingly pious intentions of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers "suspicions have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching / Washington - For a long time researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I / Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I / Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body in question was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in the Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a homemade telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is indeed an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be sighted in transit.
The big opportunity for astronomers now is to get a close look at a strange solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelly orbit that will lead it out of our system.
Comet was spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, astronomers will be able to observe it in detail, because, unlike its predecessor, 2I / Borisov has already been spotted on its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I / 2017 U1 "Oumuamua."
Initial findings on Comet 2I / Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the initial findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the comet is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered in just two years may open up a new avenue for the study of certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep the researchers busy. Just recently, a giant asteroid raced past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
'Absolutely reprehensible ': Rachel Johnson appalled by brother
Things get lonelier for Boris Johnson - first his younger brother leaves the Cabinet, now his sister lashes out at the PM's bellicose language as "distasteful," saying it was not the brother she knew.
"Capitulation," "betrayal," "treaties": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is rearming - verbally at least - which was met with massive opposition indignation at Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, and has since been echoed by other critics: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as surrender, as if opponents of leaving the EU should be "hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered." She found this utterly reprehensible and did not recognise her brother's version, said Rachel Johnson, who stood for the anti-Brexit party Change UK in the European Parliament elections.
She particularly resented the mention of her brother Jo Cox, a pro-EU MP murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 Leave referendum, whose memory could best be honoured by pushing through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very distasteful to refer to an MP who was murdered by someone shouting" Britain first, "now criticising Johnson's sister. Apparently, the perpetrator came from the far-right, who felt emboldened by" this kind of language. "It was very distasteful for those who mourned her.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used like this," he tweeted. "The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and firmly for what you believe in, whatever your views, but never" demonize the other side. "He also lamented that an atmosphere has been created in which attacks have become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and Tory MP. "I have been torn in recent months between loyalty to the family and the national interest - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson justified the move.
Johnson's language has also drawn sharp criticism in the Church. As The Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England have criticised the language, which is "unworthy of this country." In a joint statement, they said: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has been unacceptable. We should talk to each other with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is sending out a strong signal: two women with Latino roots will appear in the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, promising "an explosion of fun and energy."
Latina power at the Super Bowl: Super stars Shakira, 42, and Jennifer Lopez, 50, will perform the halftime show at the upcoming NFL Finals, organizers announced Thursday (local time).
'I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, who has incredible strength in the US, 'Shakira shared in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love the fact that this year's Super Bowl will see two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world, promising "an explosion of fun and energy" for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" and "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough came in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever."
The announcement of the half-time guests is always eagerly awaited in the USA. This year, many also see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, it is also extremely popular in Germany by now.
Last year, there was political controversy in the run-up to the national anthem because of the controversy surrounding quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand during the national anthem in protest against police brutality against blacks and was harshly attacked by US President Donald Trump, among others. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians - including Rihanna and Pink - had refused to perform at the Super Bowl. Ultimately, the performance of the rock group Maroon 5 was criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber credits Egypt's ruler: For now, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men in charge of determining whether blood is flowing again on Egypt's streets have both spent the past week abroad, with one of them arriving back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi, the ex-general who deposed the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in 2013, returning from the UN General Assembly, had a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's crackdown on political Islam and had not lost one syllable about human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. Sisi said at the airport into the microphones of state television that "Egyptians are not going to be misled."
According to the president, this is what the other man is trying to mislead, the man who currently controls the events on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he is beyond the reach of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old actor was known only to a minority of Egyptians. Today, he is the dominant voice dominating the political discourse in the country's cafes, living rooms and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel "Mohammed's Secrets," Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and has splendid new palaces built, it is said. Ali accuses the army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule of corruption and enrichment. Because he has been doing business with these same gentlemen for 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor, he seems to know pretty well what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding number of clicks show.
After thousands demonstrated against Sisi's rule for the first time since taking power last week and nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "Million March" on Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare to take to the streets, but there were sporadic smaller protests, for example in Giza, near Cairo, and in the village of Kina, near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests in which participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure, with police also using tear gas and rubber bullets. Initially, these videos could not be independently verified. Security sources said the police had stopped the protests.
Massive police presence was reported on Friday from the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters tore down banners with the president's portrait last week; security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on arterial roads; in Cairo, several downtown subway stations were closed for "maintenance work"; most streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked; and Rabaa Square, where supporters of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi, barricaded themselves in 2013 until the army set fire to them and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent disgruntled people from gathering: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a major rally for the president here, of all places.
Mohamed Ali made these precautions to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said into his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." However, this should not be interpreted as a retreat: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much power
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test possibilities.
Those who take out an internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed information provided by the provider. Customers can check for themselves how much of this is actually achieved in the event of conspicuousness.
After all, the previously promised transfer rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. For example, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests carried out by the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated in a uniform and objective manner," the Bavarian Consumer Centre states on its website.
If the connection is significantly slower than advertised, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of time, usually 14 days, to complete the promised service, which is best done in writing by registered mail.
If this does not work even after repeated requests, customers can terminate and possibly also claim damages. However, in the absence of success, only the legal action will help.
First senior Republican to call for investigation
The Vermont governor is the first senior Republican to call for an impeachment investigation of US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here will be determined by the facts that are established," Phil Scott said at a news conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking action - an impeachment process can lead to the president's ouster.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed unease about it. Scott's comments are the first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly spoken out against Trump's policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.
Spider-Man to stay at MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear what would happen with the films about Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: After "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home," Spider-Man will receive another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), according to several US media reports. Accordingly, the theatrical release is already scheduled: the film is scheduled to start in the US on July 16, 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quotes Marvel boo Kevin Feige: "I'm pleased that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are extremely pleased that we can continue to work on it... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on its Spidey verse. You never know what the future will hold."
But how did the sudden good news come about? Sony reportedly made an offer to Marvel. According to industry magazines, Disney, to which Marvel belongs, would participate with 30 percent of the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man movies. However, the news is not confirmed.
How Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry will appear in 'Suits' finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. The last episode featured many happy endings and just as many cameo appearances, as well as a charming tribute to the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and Meghan (38), who have been on the show for many years. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return for a final goodbye as Rachel Zane in the finale, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some flashbacks showed the most memorable scenes with the current duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding to Mike or how she greets him after he served his prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, in a wedding scene of course. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) strides toward the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw on a frock coat, the bemused Harvey wants to know about the groom, only to snippet: "Louis, you're not the Prince of England."
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned when a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea, killing a total of seven people, the Greek coastguard said on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and mainland Turkey. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants are currently crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people died along this route last year. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, Seehofer said on Friday that he wanted to find out "what the situation is with regard to the refugee situation" in Turkey. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help them cope.
On Friday, a spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
An unusually high number of migrants continue to arrive in Greece from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people crossed over to the Greek islands, the Greek Civil Protection Ministry said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers have recently cast doubt on the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, which provides for the EU to send back all refugees and migrants who cross illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
However, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side due to a lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people are still waiting on Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The situation is worst on Lesvos: a camp with a capacity for 650 people currently houses 5,200 migrants.
There have never been so many since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016, state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical experts, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. "For sure," said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology, "climate change will be one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years. High temperatures and large temperature jumps will cause problems for the cardiovascular system in particular within a short period of time and lead to increased heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, the elderly and diabetics are particularly affected.
Greens politician faces charges over embarrassing photo leak
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, during the election campaign - was the mug tampered with?
In a photo, the Canadian Green Party leader holds a reusable cup in her hand. But now it has emerged that the cup has been tampered with.
Ottawa / Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally caught the eye. Elizabeth May, leader of the Canadian Green Party, never held the reusable coffee mug with a metal straw in her hand. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this mug, talking to citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also circulated to the media - and then the mug was still a vile (cardboard) mug, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Greens leader faces charges over photo leak
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party was producing fake news to appear more credible on the issue of "environmental protection," in the midst of a House of Commons election campaign in which Trudeau, too, is facing growing pressure over a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked discussion about fake news, with one user sharing a comparison of the photos and writing: 'The Greens are manipulating a photo of their leader to hide their disposable mug.'
May was shocked and claimed on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: She, talking to members of the public, held a mug in her hand. However, she correctly stated that the mug was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman for the party said that it was only a matter of putting the party logo in the picture, and not of covering up anything.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did it. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she tells the Guardian, while also asking for something from her over-dedicated team: "If they feel like editing a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face to make me look younger?"
The German Greens have also come under shitstorms for their use of single-use plastic or for air travel - but their pictures were not Photoshopped. Katharina Schulze, leader of the Bavarian Greens, ate ice cream with a plastic spoon on holiday, as merkur.de * reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifetime ban on Cathay flights
Jaqueline Ng was allegedly promised an upgrade by Cathay Pacific via email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and is never allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting a spontaneous upgrade to Business Class is what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a free upgrade from Economy Class.
But this case shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer has actively asked Cathay Pacific Airlines for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng has more than 65,000 followers on Instagram, flying from Taiwan to New York on May 30 and back on June 7.
On the outbound flight, the staff refused Jaqueline an upgrade, even though she had presented an e-mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her an upgrade. Jaqueline claims to have received the letter from an airline marketing employee, but the airline accuses Jaqueline of faking the e-mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have presented the same email, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: They checked with the head office. And indeed, the employee, from whom the mail allegedly originated, denied the email contact with Jaqueline. This was confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
Airline workers at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime ban on flying with Cathay Pacific, forcing her to buy a new ticket to Taiwan for $1,400 (about 1,280 euros).
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains barred from future flights. Furthermore, the terms and conditions of the airline state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after report of Yemen ceasefire
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in a matter of minutes on Friday afternoon, with a barrel (159 litres) of Brent North Sea oil last costing $61.83 - around 1.4 per cent less than the previous day. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices fell 1.3 per cent to $55.77.
The price slide was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on oil installations in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world's oil production to a halt. Iran-allied Houthi rebels in the civil war-torn country of Yemen had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, blames Iran. A cease-fire would defuse political tension in the region.
If a deal does materialize, it could focus on growth and demand concerns, Ole Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank, told Bloomberg news agency.
Oil prices have continued their downward slide in recent days, with a barrel of WTI oil up nearly 59 dollars a week ago and Brent up nearly 65 dollars.
Recently, Bloomberg, citing insiders, reported that repairs to oil installations in Saudi Arabia are progressing faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, according to which output has returned to eight million barrels per day and is moving back toward its original level.
Recently there have been several press reports citing insiders who report on the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there have been signs of some easing of tensions between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after being detained by Iran and recently given clearance, and the crew is now preparing to depart while the ship remains anchored, CEO Erik Hånell told Swedish radio in a text message on Friday morning.
But the US announced plans to move anti-missile missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, Iran's nemesis, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the UK had pushed oil prices sharply higher at times in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
Allegations of a cover-up against the White House have emerged in the scandal over possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. Several senior administration officials have been working hard to prevent access to the transcript of the conversation after a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky at the end of July, according to an anonymous whistleblower. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, explicitly accused the White House of a "cover-up." Trump called it a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers third Trump-Kim summit questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit between leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump on the nuclear issue will take place soon, and the purpose and prospects of such a meeting are in doubt due to a lack of progress in implementing agreements reached at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the KCNA news agency.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the resolutions of last year's summit, said the adviser to the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticized tighter US sanctions and the joint military exercises of the US and South Korea. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to bring about a rapprochement.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before agreeing to it. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. Then, in June, the two met in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas, agreeing to revive the talks, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help with mine clearance
Wearing a blue anti-fragmentation vest, Britain's Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the detonation circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called for TV cameras to be running: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who have not helped clear them, to commit themselves to help."
Pound under pressure as interest rate cut expected
Sterling under pressure
With an interest rate cut imminent, the pound is depreciating against the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is weighing on sterling, with the British currency down as much as 0.4 per cent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sell-off was triggered by comments from central banker Michael Saunders, who raised the possibility of a rate cut even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty would affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future, a statement that is surprising given that Saunders is seen as a proponent of restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of broker ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the strains on the economy from the Brexit hickhack, without directly signalling an interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on 31 October if necessary without a divorce agreement.
More: The British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, argues Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated, confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and now head of integrity at the world athletics federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details of the doping scandal in Russia have come to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and even to some extent. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turns out that they were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic cheating in Russian sport was exposed, whereupon Wada banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years, during which time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual testing, the International Olympic Committee allowed around 270 athletes from the country to compete under a neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, and 168 Russian athletes competed at the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cups in the various sports, and in the summer, the World Cup was even held in Russia with the host taking part.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples in question, in order to reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping, and to help punish athletes retrospectively, and they were finally delivered three months later.
However, the chairman of the independent integrity commission (AIU) of the athletics world federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data that Wada received from a whistleblower and the data that it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The athletics federation is the only organization that remains under Russia's ban. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already exposed manipulation and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to ban Rusada again and, in the worst case scenario, also to exclude him from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
