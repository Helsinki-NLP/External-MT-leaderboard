Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
What did you enjoy the most on the way?

Why would I want to kill all of you?
The bathroom was upstairs.
She was concerned about her son.
Somehow we survived.
It seemed to me that Tom was not doing what he was supposed to be doing.

Pick one.
He got what he wanted.
She drinks like a juice.
They need each other.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
After much deliberation, I eventually did things at random.
You are absolutely right.
Tom is ruthless.
Termites eat wood.
You have failed me.
What is this?
So did I.
It was very good.
She cares for her aged mother.
This cannot be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Go straight ahead.
Just like a bean.
It is empty.
Where did you get that idea?
Maria laughed at the thought.
I am getting tired.
I cannot sit still.
Happy Resurrection

Why do you act this way?
He misses nothing.
We live in the atomic age.
Mary earns a living by sewing.

I am learning now.
When did you get home?
He asked for my help.
This is not true.
I took the first step.
Can You Keep a Secret?
I nodded once.
He does not waste words.
Did you do it on purpose?
Do not be stingy.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
This is a good textbook.
How long have you been a teacher?
Do you think I should write to Tom?
We ran out of the building.
I'm the count.
This tea is good.
Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or yawn.
I bought this yesterday.
Do you speak Greek?
It all happened at the speed of light.
What's your story?
I annoyed him.
I made a rule not to see.
I tried to be kind.
I'm not going in there!
Success has been only partial.
I'm not 100% sure.
I didn't tell her you were here.
The fuse was burned.
I didn't tell him you were here.
We protested peacefully.
Maria was furious.
Turn to the left.
Do not give up!
I know how much you do.
I can resist everything but temptation.
I paid for it.
Did you bring a fan?
You are under oath.
I wish I knew.
I do not believe it.
Are you looking for something specific?
Do not worry!
Caroline is sad because she cannot conceive.
I took off my wig.
That's my cat.
Stay there.

The bedroom is upstairs.
What's wrong with you?
She hated him.
What are you going to do today?
A taxi is expensive.

I would like to kiss you.
He told me I was cute.
My father is too old to work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
You are absolutely right.
You changed my life.
He ran away from her.
The bird on the roof is a crow.
How can I call a taxi?
You haven't answered the question.
He was bare-breasted and bare-bottomed.
I can ski.
Why do you think that?
It's snowing today.
Today I have a headache.
I think Tom pulled off a big one.
I will do my homework tomorrow.
By the way, where do you live?
The office doors are yellow.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to bed?
I have lots of friends.
This is not exactly what I wanted.
Is it yours?
The house is made of bricks.
They all lie.
I took the first step.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Can you help us?
Keep calm.
One day it will be mine.
I've had enough of this!
It was terrifying.
I won't let you do it.
How did the French class go?
Keep your thinking positive.
I made him angry.
Is breakfast included in the price?
Is everything all right between us?
What Can I Say?
Her name was unknown.
Where's my room?

At this stage of world history, there is not one such thing as an independent press in America. You know it and I know it. There is not one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he did, he would know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I have been paid regularly to keep my honest opinion outside the newspaper for which I work. Many of you have been paid similarly for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy as to write what you honestly think would be out on the street looking for some other job. If I had allowed my honest opinion to appear in just one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I would have been fired in less than 24 hours. (...)
