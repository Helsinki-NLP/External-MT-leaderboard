This is perfectly illustrated by the UKIP numbties banning HIV-borne people.
You mean Nigel Farage asking if the NHS should not be used to pay for health tourists, and asking if HIV infections were included in the inclusion.
You raise a straw man and then knock it with thinly veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need to use the NHS we have to queue up behind bigots with sense of entitlement and chronic hypochondria.
I think the straw man is yours.
Health tourism as defined by the right wing loonies is virtually absent.
I think it is called democracy.
No one would be affected by UKIP's health tourism policy so no problem.
Only in UKIP La La Land could Carswell be described as revolutionary.
The Daily Muck spew out is not evidence.
Ah, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it merely commented on it.
Whoever controls most media in this country should undead be shot for spouting populist propaganda as fact.
I don’t think you know what a straw man is.
You do not know anything about my personal circumstances or identity so I would be very careful about trying to eradicate a debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage’s comment was quite shock, but only because it is so rarely addressed.
He did not express any homophobic beliefs.
You will have to find a way to get over it.
I am not entirely sure what you are trying to say, but my guess is that you dislike the media reporting things you disagree with.
It is so rarely addressed because unlike Fararge and his Thatcherite fools who think aids and floods are a signal from the divine and not a reflection on their own ignorance in understanding human complexities as something to celebrate, then no.
In the end the situation is just as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the austerity period will not have fixed anything.
Looking for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a real joke.
Ireland, the European Tiger they used to describe to us years ago.
We know the rest!
It starts again when you read this article.
Their false claims are that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, the lowest taxes on companies in Europe, a very flexible labor market, continuing migration.
With these ingredients, no further crow about with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, along with Portugal. However, with a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is still better than it was before.
Greece was ahead.
It is clear that the development was not a long quiet river, given recent events.
The lowest taxes in Europe?
That is not correct!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate for companies.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France from politicians on the taxes that multinationals really pay.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they generally pay less than 5% in France.
Only SMEs pay the full lot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and new (and expensive) cars are on every street corner, exactly like before the 2008 crisis.
The recovery is evident in daily traffic jams from when the schools return.
This is business news?
Please, I am sure the comments section will be taken off soon.
In another article they are drafting now, there were 2 Vauxhaul Astras involved in a fender bender on the A140.
This is how Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers to flights?
The Chief Executive is buying a whole new fleet of planes soon so a few bumps and scratches on his old ones will soon be forgotten.
Maybe I'm flying with him next week so I hope it will not be on one of these two after they have been patched up.
The other pilots will be all the other pilots fault.
RyanAir charged passengers for the extra fear they supplied with?
Only for Irish companies like this you cannot go on hols young man.
I have never flown Ryanair and last 3 times I flew I went BA.
I prefer my airlines to offer me customer service.
No but it is Ryanair, so they can have a pop.
Any article about Ryanair attracts dozens of comments from people who would never fly Ryanair, to those who like flying Ryanair and think anyone getting more than the basic fare is only themselves to blame, etc.
It is pretty transparent.
Ryanair are not going to be happy about the extra cost involved in this incident.
When will the delays last and will Ryanair get compensation to passengers as the airport air traffic controllers have a mistake.
Pax were on a different aircraft within an hour, no compo due.
Sorry to disappoint you and your compo state of mind.
You are all welcome on board this British airways flight bringing British Isis to Syria, init as you say.
Enjoy the ride!
Last Sunday in Paris, the Francophile street: the Marais is largely pedestrianized, and literally swarming with people.
The people have not gathered massively for the quality of the restaurants (average, mostly) or for the Journal fair at the Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly outmoded).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the area is incredibly lively and animated.
With a lot of foreigners who spend their time in the city, many of them are...
Do you think that Sunday openings are going to create jobs?
The shops are open on Sundays, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that seems to be admissible to me is the one of the areas that receive significant number of foreign tourists and this is further defined by the fact that they are buying tax-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable amount of sales revenue each year for the same reasons.
The industry continues, where expensive equipment, used on Sunday, allows lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right that employees, except exceptions, enjoy.
It is provided for and regulated by the labor code.
No ministry responsible for economic development nor the one responsible for international affairs have any capacity to reform the labor code.
So they should shut up.
What use is law?
To satisfy a part of the population and the companies who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday afternoon I take my children to the municipal library.
In my Town with 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France, the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not on weekends!
It is access to culture...
It is also the regulation of working hours.
The way of life that he defended so vigorously against fascism
The way of life that he defended so courageously against fascism and Bolshevism
How about the estate of his daughter, despite her will, is simply told to pay up on IHT?
They are paintings.
Some OK, some poor.
The estate would want their pound of meat so speaking.
Nationalists/Franco winning the Civil War.
The antipathy to independence for places like Ireland and India and his overall fascist view and throw in his well known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
No I am.
But for five years and five only mind, he was perfect.
The latter stood against his fellow aristos in Government in 1940 who wanted to discuss ' terms' with the Nazis and very well saw them off.
By din of his magnificent oratory and energy he brought this country together to understand that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of UK , France, Belgium and ultimately the rest of the world can thank god, that for those five years, just those five years, Churchill was at the helm, and no other.
The greatness of Churchill is irrelevant to this debate.
The descendants of the artist sell the paintings on the open market to raise money for IHT, they may even make a profit.
If the public want any of them on display in a museum, they can raise money and buy them.
It is that simple.
But we can use the tax money.
No doubt that "cometh day" Churchill's personality was a positive benefit to his country in WW11.
A relaunch of internal market by public works will only benefit large companies, who will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the true French difficulty, lack of dialogue.
Return to the first values.
An unemployment insurance reform is not contradictory.
The weakest of us should not be in need!
They either come to their assistance in solidarity or they are liable to the services they provide or provide, to the minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the minimum wage is a reflection of this vision.
There is also the lessee who lives off the revenue from his properties.
There is room to differentiate between someone who invests for a return when they retire and someone who lives off their income.
A property to rent, or even two for couples, above is a vice.
The little Finance genius is extremely lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy for major projects, but at a time with no major infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so no way would a new deal be a solution.
Above all at a time when decline is emerging in response to a recession, which is only a wild decline, therefore brutal.
You would have been right 30 years ago: greater need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, motorways...
If we want to make the future climate-energy shock less severe, then investment is essential: insulation, renewal of the rail network, urban transport, energy transport and storage, etc.
A tax system that favours high income and independent people.
Who is in power?

Charles Arthur is such a scamp.
iPhone 6 and budget rivals hit Samsung profits
Apple’s introduction of the larger-screened iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in mid September may have lure some would-be Galaxy buyers away.
I test all the phones and decided on LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer but not to Apple.
I think it is vital that we have alternatives.
Microsoft instituted this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google, Apple and the opensource community.
We need several thriving platforms, to spur competition and development.
We also have completely different requirements and these cannot be satisfied by any one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For myself, I tend to buy Apple, because I like the core philosophy and appreciate design.
Some people are completely unaffected by design, they value features, function and price.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Leave the mentality of seeking "one best platform".
There is no one best car manufacturer, not really, they are different, yet similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
This is healthy and needs to be encouraged.
It is in our collective interest to do so.
I am happy that you found exactly what you wanted and that it is not an Apple product, even though I myself made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Should our friends from UMP who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course the Parisian bohos) tell us which author/s' gender ideas they are combating and specify exactly which works they are intending to combat.
They only attack gender as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Actuelles?
They are sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Congratulations, Jean! You are a very intelligent and cultured person.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a parallel that I do not have (I do not have her sharpness of mind).
Otherwise, all things considered, this subject is not interested me, and I sincerely cannot see the problem.
recognize that culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes is a cultural effort.
Who is scared asks the World?
What do those who are scared fear do?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by referring to Judith from the Bible, the second by describing Judith Butler as a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how these studies affect the most intimacy of them.
We are clearly no longer in the debate of ideas.
This is something else, much deeper.
Does you have read that the Monde published an article on the need for theology?
@: As it was about a debate of ideas, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Intention to combat ideas from the only report that their critics make of it (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of Gender Theory, or X Lacroix, theologian) seems to be very rigorous.
However, as I was explaining to our friend from the UMP, that is the difference between an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that he has understood the nuance.
The first sex (it is more from my time) was a very symbolic throat slicer, which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I was viewing the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red flashes as the Moon briefly revealed itself when the clouds parted.
This sudden appearance of the red Moon had its charm, and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of clouds completely blocking the view at times.
FNQ was a wonderful place to be.
The clouds were very much covering the coast of Victoria and NSW, while much of Australia was clear.
News Flash Blood Moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey blames Labor.
If Labor agrees to our unfair budget we will restore it to its correct colour as soon as possible.
Obsession, much?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw nothing but clouds.
The Melbourne suburb also managed to cloud over for the entire week of the Perseid meteor shower and for practically every major astronomical event in recent years.
I am starting to think there is a gremlin whose sole job is to stop Melbourne residents from seeing anything of the sky.
The Dividing Range is not the best site for an observatory, but things get much better on the other side of The Dividing Range.
There were stretches of 10-20 minutes where I couldn't see the eclipse due to clouds over suburban Melbourne.
I am putting a TAX on this eclipse.
ANYONE looking at this eclipse will be TAXED.
I bet Abbott is your first thought, and your last thought each night.
What / whom will you obsess with when he (inevitably) goes?
You seem to have spent quite some time searching for posts that are negative about the Abbott government and then accusing THEM of being obsessed.
Great Photo of the Moon over The Sydney Harbour Bridge.

However, it seems that these are the examples to follow.
The notary reform would produce a claim for compensation in the region of 8 billion euros.
The minister of economy claims that these claims for compensation are not well-founded.
What if there is an error by the Ministry of Economy?
Should the decision makers, having taken the political profit from the courageous attack of the notaries, have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The continuation in its own time.
OK, thank you, JYL....
No, the State is not comparable to households in terms of budget management, as the State's time horizon is theoretically infinite, while that of the household is restricted by the lifetime of its members.
Moreover, unless considered that public spending is unproductive, they contribute towards funding tangible and intangible investments, guarantees of future growth and, therefore, future solutions.
Answers.
A regrettable decision.
The sacred Hippocratic oath: the health of the global pharmaceutical companies' bottom line must be kept above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
The truth is different from your delusion.
The medical staff would like to administer it, but are hamstrung by the law as determined by the politicians.
It is the same situation as for the drug to medically induce abortions rather than risky surgery, safe injecting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the street etc.
The politicians spread their spread on these issues.
By way, doctors do not make money from drugs.
It is why pharmacists exist.
While the Liberals want to transform our medical system into the US system, you need to read about how it works.
Doctors are courted similarly worldwide but with different degrees of visibility.
The OP may have phrased it poorly with blame on medicos side, but reality is that many countries, including Australia, give preference to company profits and "research".
Read up on the relatively few reports on our PBS costs and negotiations with drug companies compared to other countries.
Compare world wide drug prices, which are all over the world, as well as the differences between OTC and script only from country to country.
It is political and business process, not a medical or scientific process, whether direct or indirectly.
Actually there are companies testing Marijuana sprays for oncology pain, despite severe and inhibiting laws and regulations.
While some drug manufacturers may not be happy about alternatives such as marijuana, those who can get a good quality version in known doses will do well.
Sorry to say this Miss but your call is off, there is much going on behind the scene with Dr's and Pharmacy.
As for this Hospital, they were happy feeding the Oil until someone took a "Whisper" in the ear of an EOC of said Hospital.

If social sciences "researchers" did research instead of politics or network, perhaps we could use their work.
A researcher investigates, but he does not compare one fact with another.
Comparing is not research.
Comparing is teaching not researching.
It is not possible to say "the research succeeded, it must be applied" and then in the same breath "excessively tested".
If you research succeeded, why test it out?
If your research failed, why do you ask that they be applied?
How can you explain to me how a piece of research can conclude that a pupil who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other subjects more easily?
New technology allows learners to learn by learning how to use new technology, but how do they learn the new technology if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator. Let us make an indicator that enables us to find indicators that are satisfactory for us.

A single track for training teachers: move sophists and ideology away from training and let practitioners teach practitioners.
Please read the paragraph on placements (which is unfortunately not well argued) and you will see that your conclusion is almost always a device that leads to the most ineffective conservatism:
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must not have any place.
Practitioners must have one.
Wish you to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never been in an operating theatre before?
There is no consensus about the causes of the problems in the education system.
giving more weight to education theorists would mean permanently destroying it.
If I do not like to be operated on by a practitioner who only has theoretical training and who learned on the job.
Mike Weatherman, the Tory MP placed in charge of copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop doing it ?
Someone should make a citizens arrest.
Lol exmaiers thanks for that.
If I ever start getting a huge amount of copyright infringement I need to read this article.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
As they are required to properly reference sources.
In many cases it costs no money to properly license content.
No, it is copyright infringement.
Not a different thing.
When you use content without properly license it is depriving the artists of their lives.
You can argue the pedantic if and buts to justify yourself - but it is theft.
And you can say it is as often as you want, but that will not make it true.
It is copyright infringement.
Go on, say again.
If I ever start feeling guilty about copyright infringement, I will start to feel guilty about copyright infringement.
You are clearly comfortable depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should get money for images used in school reports, almost perfect definition of what should be fair use, I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how if children produce any content and publish it on their favourite social media sites, they give any IP to the site according to the T&Cs they clicked through.
If they share an earphone connected to a mp3 player with a friend on the bus they should be expelled for such disregard of the law.

I have 2 children and when they are at an age to choose, I will advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France drags everyone down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What drags France down are speeches like yours.
@gus I have worked in private companies for almost a lifetime.
I was lucky to work in companies run by good business leaders: it is rare in France.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to manage a company and this choice allows me to lay into hopeless bosses, who I often meet.
Feeling very comfortable, I fully agree with Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he is telling the truth!
When we compare with German companies, the French business leaders are constantly quoted as demanding reforms in France, while in Germany, companies knew how to structure their industrial framework to be competitive, particularly by ensuring the link between large, medium and small companies.
State to hold its hand?
This State which accuses them of being incompetent?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business leader verse from you!
Remind me, what have you created in terms of jobs, in added value, to be so harsh?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders incapable of creating jobs and who slumber and shiver waiting for permanent help from the State!
It is very sick!
The solutions are a few: abolition of the Labor Code, employer contributions, taxes, working 45hours/week paid for 35, and some, walking on eggshells, dare to call for reduction of salaries if not their abolition!

The ironic thing is that people always complain about First group.
As far as I can see from distance Last has not been an investment for us taxpayers.
The steady as she goes operation, rather than transformative.
It is not to say that there have not been improvements to railways in Scotland while Last started the services.
However, there were improvements to railways in Scotland with their predecessors, including British Rail.
We have not got the balls to do that, alas.
tried to get them recently but it did not work.
Still, Labour will sort that for us, will they...
It is an international spin-off company.
The train already operates in Germany.
There is no stopping people in UK creating a company with ethics and biding for contracts.
We seem to have problems with running things, few of our privatised services have ended up being UK run.
I just remember the uproar and criticism when the Virgin contract went to First, only for the decision to be cancelled.
It gets better, MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the contract to operate Crossrail for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they repeatedly told us during the referendum campaign, are all in favour of pooling and sharing, and think the working people should all stick together without borders.
They are probably pleased with this decision.
Maybe that's because the Netherlands have a track record (literally) for running railways well and the UK do not.
It is not simply a change of ownership ScotRail needs but some new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice but the real problem is the ludicrous franchising system, not the franchiser.

Disease recovery is not a merit affair.
Come on start over again..
I am not saying that it is the condition to cure, I am saying that it HELPS.
No merit to do.
As for the examples from your life, only you can judge them.
I will start over.
The temptation to insinuate, if only for a moment, that one can deserve to get over an illness or that one cannot deserve to get over it is quite simply monstrous.
The body follows or it follows.
A body that lets go, all over, without will, without confidence in medicine, do you have any idea of what that means?
Sorry to think the opposite, if having a strong moral capacity allows one to accept tough treatments easily and to prepare oneself for them, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them because of fear...
Everyone who fights in medicine is above all someone who trusts medicine...
If one prefers to leave it up to the "lord", that's something else...
No merit nor courage.
This consideration is characteristic of moralists.
When you catch a bug, a real one, you strip yourself of everything to the point of being a zombie.
Personally, I have caught two of them, bugs, big ones, and I "fight" them, as they say, that completely escaped my mind.

I thought the case against Milosevic was decided and finalized about 10 years ago.
I have not seen the man's name in print in at least that long.
What's going on?
It is an anniversary.
A forgotten one.
The trial was swiftly ended and then swept under the carpet.
This story was told back then?
Communist-turned-nationalist who has ignited three Balkan wars in the past decade?
Communist President of a Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please, ask the fact that is conveniently misunderstood:
Explain how NATO bombing was legal under ANY international law norms.
What country was Serbia attacked?
When talking about RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia) why do you fail to mention how NATO blew up that building killing civilians and then declared it a valid target.
Milosevic was done but one flips the coin: If he failed to defend his country against NATO attack he would be crucified as a traitor.
If he did, he would get eaten by western justice system.
Westerners deemed false flag and detached from a sovereign state which later unilaterally declared its independence and was expressly recognised by western states.
Serbian population now is non-existent (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica who is mentioned here, politically died after his first term after failing to comprehend situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the past.
In the end, Guardian staff should not call Milosevic a tyrant (as much as he was not popular among us).
As far as I know, only in Greece is there a method that works more or less, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is without doubt useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.
This water is not related to that of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years away from Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which is "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study led by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine from the University of Maryland.
The method to be followed then.
Like those involving animals being threatened.
Thank you Passeur de Sciences for treating us, often, to these experimental feats that are achieved in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements which evolve in an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
The odorless gas is prior to humans but may be detected by animals.
All these methods are undetectable by humans, but not for the measuring instrument they have at their disposal.
But we do not have reliable results on these clues...
The evidence for strange behavior of animals during an earthquake has been many times (and for centuries) that certain animals act in a strange way for a few hours with an earthquake, especially pigs, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
The report on the arte channel told of the fight between two scientific teams, one Californian, and the other Japanese, to ensure the recognition of their work, which was about animal sensitivity to earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly about their modification before an earthquake.
The scientists have convinced me!
How far have we reached this research?
Why so much contempt to this field?
We should learn how to listen to nature again...
If one examines things calmly and rigorously, one publishes it in a serious journal, and no one looks down on it.
When we talk about animal signs, we get a similar slant: remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish was strangely going around in circles.
I cannot understand why anyone believes Boris will make a good Tory Leader.
The London Major has reached his reach.
The LBC phone-in and you cannot help but thinking this man has no clue and is always desperate to distract you with a joke.
He never gives straight answers to anything.
Another point he said was that he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked what he agreed on?
The man could not name any thing.
The candidate made so many promise to get elected as Major and has not kept any.
Straightly underlines what a crock of sh1t the rest of the T Party are.
Because he is popular.
Because he's funny.
He has been on Have I Got News For you.
Because he is a celebrity and people have been trained to worship celebrities.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
If he takes over as leader, the Tories poll ratings will go through the roof I am sure.
God help us.
I am not sure - the public love a joke but do not necessarily want one for PM.
It is exactly what they said about Londoners.
The House Brick Should have been taken with him.
In many ways, I think he is a model for one R Branson.
Americans had one for a president.
The French are really and always uninterested in the Pacific War.
For those who have wanted to read some books on it (including one in French and an excellent one by B.
Solomon and the iron bottom sound speak as unfortunately as the dead who remain there.
The Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must still be at the bottom since the Savo battle), do not want to return to Savo.
The Island of Savo was also a bit further, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
Good work kids.
The environmental side is a complete smoke screen.
Computing the amount of oxygen consumed to reach the target totally undermines the concept...
It is enough to go through the list of sponsors. Only philanthropists.
Other communication plan that is no longer done nor should be done.
Blimey, it makes you want to do so much!!!
I am waiting for the web series impatiently!
Your story makes me dream, by identifying myself little in passing (I also learned to sail with the Elorn Crocodiles in the White Mill in Brest harbour).
Good work also for the environmental message, even if some criticize the impact of the journey.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us dream, and to show pride that Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening. I think the extremist who protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies should not devote a penny of our taxes to fund the dreams of some adventurers, even those as nice as those ones!
There are any players in the current Serbian set up of Kosovan descent?
They are from Mitrovica but I do not know if they are still in the squad.
Bisevac is Lyon's defender not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s, and coach of many teams in Greece, but I do not know where.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and played as a striker for the great Velez side that, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished as runners-up in the Yugoslav league (and also included such luminaries as Vahid Halilhodic and Arsene Wenger's trusty side Boro Primorac).
Why, thanks Mole!
I know who Haliodzic and Primorac are.
Because of interest, what happened to Krasic?
The next big thing was expected at Juve and is currently in Turkey but last time he appeared on my radar he was linked with Blackburn *shudder*
No help there.
Then he moved to Fener, and as far as I know he is not regular there.
There may be a second move in him, maybe Indian Super League?
Come on Serbia.
Albania ' do not fear.
You should love albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is, the flag in that dron was not the flag of the current, current Albania.
It was apparently the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where Albanians are present.
A bit of excessive nationalism, basically.
Thankfully, there were no significant casualties (I know of).
actually, it was the Albanian flag shaped like the map of not the so-called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the European Great Powers decided to give parts of the country to the neighboring countries.
How can one feel "a explosion of joy" seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and probably children were inside?
How??
What bothers me is the fact that you could, even if it was only once, spontaneously celebrate the death of thousands of people; in my eyes it shows a "border line" personality, whose "accounts" should be taken with the highest scrutiny.
No doubt that in the short moment of "joy" one will not have thought of the dead nor the reality of the horror caused.
One will only have thought for a moment that, for once, Muslims had successfully and apocalytically hurt the big bad Satan in his heart.
Doing something powerful.
Something grand.
It seems that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims seeking humiliation.
With accounts filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had some doubts.
The West “Christian/white/Gauls” cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he ponders the general poverty, social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab-Muslim world today.
Cairo or Algiers are suburbs, not the towers of Dubai.
The former splendor, certainly glorified, is no consolation.
How can the Muslim world get out of this diabolic hole?
Entirely in accordance, 2 major poisons run through the Arab World I: the bigoted conservatism of the authority and fascistic nihilism.
The common thing, suspension of thought and the mild or armed excommunication of their critical expression.
As may be understood before, do not make Muslims retreat.
This is the only way.
Has Edwy Plenel read the article?
In many countries I suspect that it is true.
In England autumn is the start of six long wet miserable dark months that affect many people's wellbeing and mood.
Every one gets ill, too.
Seasonal Affective Disorder.
I suffer from it myself.
When that light starts to go it is hell for me and those like me.
A dose of Vitamin D can help some of the mood and well being issues.
Autumn in England is beautiful, with or without rain.
The countryside is particularly breathtaking in autumn.
Autumn greenery is not as breathtaking as summer greenery when everything is alive instead of on the verge of death.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, so be not a cliche parroting grump!
Not everyone.
I seldom get ill in Winter.
However now I am retired and no longer developing immunity to germs in the wider world, that may change.
It is not the death barrier it is just one point in a cycle...
The gorgeous fruity point with lots of intoxicating smells, a build up of excitement to festivals like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, snowing in and many other wonderful words.
Please do not stop doing stuff!
One festive wreath of recommends heading your way.
Yes, dark and gray months are indeed happier and more relaxed.
For children’s increases, it is the amount collected by the State from deciles 8 to 10.
The number of households who have seen their taxes increase following this measure is highest in diagram 2.
The abolition of the half share for above all widows was not addressed at all or rather its impact was completely underestimated: 230 million euros is a joke that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and does not imply that it is painless.
It is not about improving.
We are not penniless course, but wise.
If for once the PS makes a policy that is left-leaning, we're not going to cry...
The 20% richest must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Continue like this and you will encourage this 20% to work less or to leave.
It is not politically correct, but I am saying it anyway.
Long live the Trotskyists and the OCIs recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you cannot see what you are looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
Fair taxes are when it stops anyone from getting as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
After the usefulness of money has been exceeded, money is not used for more than to make money, and that is bring misfortune to as many as possible.
One is part of the richest 20%.
The 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, a part of which is logically distributed).
Fair tax must allow these households to make the most of their efforts.
Better to give up and live on social benefits, especially if one has social housing.
The utopias of the khmer rouge head cutters have a good day.
Both AirBNB's in Norway recently.
No problems.
We had things you would not get in a 5 star hotel in one place and we did not have to check in or deal with any hassle.
When you get there, you go in, stay, tidy and leave.
The first port of call every time I travel.
Logo has changed folks...
Insurance before letting your home.
Most require a form of landlord insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the correct logo!
Ah 6h too late.
Love Airbnb.
It is not.
You just go very unlucky.
According to the link in the article:
The credit of Airbnb for the response to Teman was almost absurdly quick.
In 24 hours, Airbnb sent a locksmith to change his locks, made plans to put him up in a hotel for a week, and wired him $3,817.
What is this article quoting Teman as complaining that there was no support from Airbnb?
LOVE AIRBNB- for host and travel
Hello I am looking for people who have used airbnb before for some reassurance.
I am looking to put down deposits and months rent at once but be careful of sending £1600 to a site I never really know.
What are we going to?
"Support the troops" sang the Bu$cher over and over again...
Harmless weapons then.
I am sure that it will please the families and loved ones of millions of Kurds killed in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends died from something other than Saddam Hussein's chemical bombardments.
Unless the content of this article was radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).
Moreover, how could this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later still work?
The author's style is not quite clear: "looking for mass destruction weapons.
We completely agree.
Do you believe that this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education?
It is never the time to strengthen education as we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it still the time to strengthen education as we still fight?
It already strengthens education a lot if we made them work 35 hours instead of 17.
Today, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
They cannot make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme.
The National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the school/high school for its teachers, so they work at home.
A sort of forced telework all in all, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
Moreover, it is so busy with 17 hours a week and 4 months of holidays that we cannot fill the CAPES exam. Please, come on, we are waiting for you.
How does that not make you want to put up with poorly educated brats whose parents spit on you like little shit?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where one sees that the Bush administration did absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate position was sales in London earning bugger all money.
A year later I saw an advert for being a grunt on London Underground which paid £5000 a year more and you did not even need GCSEs.
Never look back.
On topic, do not worry about getting a graduate position, get something that either earns you decent money or that you enjoy.
If I stay in graduate positions I would still be paying off my student loan.
I dont really like corporate work, so hope to move into government work or into academe.
LOL LOL This article is so late!
When I graduated in 2011 there was already a three year backlog.
Best way to reduce unemployed graduates?
Scrap the mickey mouse degrees such as art/english/drama/media/philosophy/politics or dole studies as they are known.
I had one of those degrees and ended up as a production manager.
The most important thing was not the degree but as the above article pointed out, a strong work history, starting at school and continuing through University.
The start salary was low but you soon move through the ranks as out in the real world it becomes more about doing than knowing.
This engineering/arts ball has been running for years.
Scientists are not the cure for every problem, it's more important to get up, turn in time and deal with people in a way that gets things done.
English, Philosophy and Art are Mickey Mouse degrees?
That is ridiculous.
Probably you mean media studies and whatever Philistinism subject you studied.
English, Philosophy, Politics and Art are serious degrees.
We need people who can explain the big issues to high schoolers - who can understand and champion pillars of culture such as literature and art and others.
Why would a genuine territorial policy not be better to clear Paris and dynamise France?
However, I cannot see the very depths of Essonne and the Val-d'Oise people doing 80km there and back every day to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner city and the inner ring road have many much more practical public transport means (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secured and locked park systems, as already exist in North Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by 2RMs.
Incidentally, one hopes that Paris will work with professionals from Netherlands and Denmark.
They may also benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
The only single bike rack is not available.
Motivation seems to be greater when it involves finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë...
It is no good at all.
When you ask people about why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons for why they do not pedal are: 1/ it is so dangerous with all these cars, trucks, scooters, which drive extremely fast and do not care about the survival of bicycles 2/ we take a lot of pollution into our body.
Cycling lanes is apartheid, we must co-exist but balance the occupation of urban space.
No bike rides in greater Paris?
Not a word on bike spaces on public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of bicycle trips is ridiculous.
I am starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo duped the greens.
Additionally, according to what OR reports, EELV assistants seem to be skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
After the shakedown starts you need to know who was behind the mass murder.
Hint: It was not Russia.
Not sure if I like the way the world is going.
That sounds terrible.
My children are not financial assets.
A lawyer has expressed intention to bring a case before the ECHR, but I have not seen any reports of a case being filed.
Also, they would have to file a lawsuit in Germany or Ukraine first.
I would expect such cases to be delayed to wait for the outcome of the air crash investigation and the criminal investigation which follows it.
Libya did not blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines are not at fault, the fault lies with the authority responsible for air space safety, in this case Ukraine.
What was the accident likely to occur?
Other jets were shot down previously, Ukraine was launching air attacks on rebels in the area and they would of course see any aircraft as an immediate threat.
Should Ukraine government take reasonable measures in the face of an obvious threat or would it choose to gamble the lives of the innocent to collect lucrative fly over fees from airlines?
What are all the pro Kiev trolls defending their coup Government/the ultra nationalists of West Ukraine - and arguing that Putin basically shot down MH17.
As far as I know there is already a legal action against Kiev's government as they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: A judgment by the International Court of Justice in 1986 held that the CIA supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua by the CIA did not mean America was responsible for their actions.
The chances of Russia allowing this to go to the ICJ are zero.
It is funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian backed rebels.
I hope that he can produce the evidence to back his claims.
So far investigators have not said any such things.
Ricardo is a distressing person!
Polar and lose the north is delightful.
One phylistic question: is the poor person of today poorer than the poor person of yesterday?
I cannot stop myself from remarking that most of the people who criticize Piketty's book have not read it!
It is easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income/production, income/capital, inequalities/concentration, inequality of income from work, ownership of capital, merit and heritage in the long term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today is returning to that of the start of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that the 2 world wars that caused the decline of capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration picks up after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long you took to read this huge article knowing that individual concentration capacity has limits.
Next, the question is not knowing if it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis that the press has given of it is fair or not.
If it is fair, one can debate it without reading the book, which essentially involves arguing one side in favor of this one.
No, it is not easy to read...
Bernajuzan: how long did it take you to read it?
The central thesis of this huge book summarized by the press is false?
Read not and I will not read it.
The summary of its central thesis is that which seems to be a clear sham.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Humans have not become globally rich?
This enrichment added to population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an interesting person and deserves the award without a doubt.
Remember that she is only 17 years old.
The age where most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a lucky life.
The prize is not the political capital from western governments wanting to prove the old adage of deviant darkies being evil evil evil.
Malala must realize that she is being used and no action will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere - even in working class areas in UK!
What do you think about her speech?
The mother appreciates her father for giving her freedom but added that if she were not now she would have been married off at 14.
Malala is a "deviant darkies"?
You should not be given 'air time' on this site.
You are, yourself, a dangerous deviant.
How absolutely disgusting.
No her father was going to marry her at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
The father runs a school for girls and is in favor of equal rights for women.
The husband is and was a favour of her both getting a university education and having the right to decide her own marriage plans.
However he is an unusual Pakistani man in that he believes women are equal to men.
The average Pakistani girl is often looking at marriage by the time she is 14 with no choice in the matter.
Sorry she didn't phrase it artfully enough for you.
It may seem contradiction, but maybe she means that without her father giving her freedom she would have been married at 14.
The most disappointing opening to season 4 was Jessica Lange who appeared to have difficulty finding her double character, Marlene Dietrich.
The last two seasons are quite different, but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is close to perfection and the show with Jessica Lange singing the anachronistic Life on Mars by Bowie is simply incredible.
I have not watched this new series yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange meh).
In the case of American Horror Story I preferred to watch it all in one go to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
One thing is sure, apart from Jessica Lange, it is above all risks in the editing and casting that struck me.
In AHS we have a huge flood of original shots that quite well describe the aseptization of today's productions.
I cannot understand why you throw in the towel in advance for next seasons without even waiting to assess the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly one of the mainstays in this series, but as you said, there are many other things.
Jessica Lange (and above all her voice and way she uses it) is absolutely one of the series’ most important pillars apart from some technical qualities.
And well I watch it a lot for her.
Then I find that the series is flawed by its writing, it wants to do too many things at once.
Season 3 was slightly below par, in the 2nd it was too fragmented despite some good episodes.
I do not see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it will end like 24 otherwise.
All of us do what they want to, eh!
It is not because I say "I will not watch anymore afterwards" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal for it.
After all, this is my opinion.
Less talk of tax rises, please - just get on with cutting state spending.
No, let’s increase spending please.
The slashers have failed.
Picking noisy fights over relatively small expenditure, such as foreign aid
The problem is that it is less than the margin of error for Government expenditure in UK.
The reality is that we are all talking about a difference in emphasis rather than the direction that voters appear to want and all the while some on all sides believe that the difference in emphasis is much more substantial and substantial than they believe.
Less than 1pc of managed expenditure.
The "debt" is mainly held by financial institutions in this country.
The "debt" is nothing to panic about.
I would be relaxed about the government appropriating one third of my income (before we get on to tax on spending) if I felt it would use it wisely.
It is not my fault and many taxpayers feel the same.
However, if you add up our EU net contribution, overseas aid, HS2, subsidy to near-useless wind farms and nuclear power stations you get a figure that makes Labour's / Lib-Dem's mansion tax seem very small beer.
Your first 10,000 is tax free.
This means that someone earning £35,000 a year will pay around £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone on £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc.
National insurance?
National insurance, plus council tax, plus parking charges and road tax, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from source before council tax and road tax.
I am a good candidate, but not wildly so.
No, I am not against it.
However, let's not pretend that there is a magic money tree or that billions of pounds of taxes do not matter.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work door to door prove it?
Even though 20% of unemployed people were not looking, that means that 80% are looking and do not find anything.
As an unemployed person, would it be better for me if the others look or not?
If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, that increases my chances of success.
In fact I have not heard any news from the employment center for months, which means the agents are more busy with monitoring operations than with bringing back job advertisements.
I do not see interest.
It is not up to the State to provide the jobs.
If the employment center does not provide enough posts, then one must do without the employment center.
How is this sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that unemployed people fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
As a conductor asks for transport tickets from transport users, or a department head asks for employees about their work, etc.
No one calls it a scandal in this case, right?
The only two times I have been in the employment center, my rights to the ARE were poorly established, and on one of the files, reduced by 40%, I had to fight a tough battle.
That takes time!
I am not an expert on law.
Recording information and monitoring are now the main focus of the employment center, while statutorily the employment center is close to being an insurance company.
However, I would add that compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and French non-employees grant themselves rights that they do not have!
This is not normal.
Additionally, adequate unemployment insurance contributes to improved status of employed work.
waiting for disastrous tweets in arabic...
In fact it is important to have direct military response in Iraq/Syria to stop Isis so that the virus cannot reach that war zone.
This situation would then mirror the situation of the Black Death in 1348/9 connected to war and displacement of people.
Saudi Arabia has had good sense in banning Muslim Pilgrims from the 3 affected countries from making the Haj to Mecca this year.
The Pais report reports 7400 were turned down for visas due to origin or previous travel.
There was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia contracting smallpox in Mecca during a Haj in the 1980s, probably from a pilgrim from Somalia where it was still holding out.
Now lets see some good sense in the rest of the world.
Callous to stop flying people with Ebola into Europe?
Thought it was pure common sense but apparently those 'in know' decided to gamble with the lives of 10,000's is okay.
West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be kept under strict quarantine.
Nobody leaves.
Only healthcare workers are allowed in.
A 21 days wait after treating a patient before they can leave.
If they contract Ebola while stationed there, they stay there until they recover.
This is not draconian measures.
The last week people have been coming down with the disease who have had contacts with people in West Africa despite taking all necessary precautions.
The spread of this disease will be stopped.
It is mainly spread via airlines.
Stop them from operating in those countries.
Also, airport agents should be trained to be on the lookout for Ebola-like symptoms so that those who do get it can be immediately quarantined.
If he manages to pass the message on individual first and group (including religious ones) second and he will have the Nobel peace prize.
I doubt that he can set as dogma the image of God characterised by all the cells of the planet in operation.
He is still far away from this design.
It has only been 20 years since information has appeared as the bonus to humans, while religion, from the cerebellum, has directed our actions since Lucy.
What is the point of being an usually Protestant church?
If you have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to stick to it.
The ones who criticize do not always get into the Church, but to see the low number of Protestants in France is sufficient to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next stage, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
Sorry, the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe that would make it possible to reach more people...
Sorry, Martine E, to be honest (usual) the respect for others was a traditional concept.
Hillel already spoke one century before him: "do not do to your neighbor that you do not want him to do to you, this is the whole of the Torah and the rest is commentary: go out and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but it introduces agape.
Your "advance justice, peace, and fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next stage: remove the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who turned moral laws upside down by redefining human rights.
Christians will then be ready to take their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
The low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and moved into immigration a few centuries ago.
The choice is so huge, between this, the new Alien game or Wasteland 2.
The new Elite game is coming soon.
You just can't make it up.
I would personally go with SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (backed the kickstarter for it) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are after the PC version, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also have 20% off voucher.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM for £30 and also have a 20% off voucher.
I will check it out.
Probably not from work.
The IT killjoys block all fun websites.
Hi, is it 30 and then another 20% off?
However, the PC version is only Dx11.
Caught me out - I have bought it but cannot play it.
I also bought it via Steam - no refunds, which sucks.
Time for a new vid card then *slaps*
It is a Brazil site but you get a Steam ID to use.
Warnings and all that - I have not used it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC £35 xbox 360 & PS3 £44 for xbone & PS4
Thanks, I am concerned they might remove it from your library one day if they decide to crack down on people from outside the target region buying it from there.
Jump on the beta train for Elite: Dangerous.
So, France in 1940 was a "putrid breeding ground"?
This Nobel prize looks to me to be a poisoned chalice.
One must love France of the 40s, the one with the "strange defeat"?
If one sees who wins the Nobel in literature, one asks if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we do not even want to read the winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australia will read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a world so limited and egocentric?
However, I do not believe that other Nobels are more credible, but I do not doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso are only remotely connected to literature.
Read him at least?
Other Nobel prize winners?
This would be better to judge.
As for Chinese, Brazil and others, do not worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, them.
They will know how to appreciate Mr. 
Modiano's true value if they do not already know him!
Your part, continue to see Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
H. Now let’s see who won the Nobel prize in literature:
Pinter in 2005, D.
Morning chumps.
Since I drive one in Iceland, I keep seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
It feels like the thing followed me back.
Maybe it plans to run me over?
I consume me like the typical computer in Superman III?
Morning Dantra, Still raging?
Morning DQ - not today, I have taken my pills.
It’s Wednesday!
I have had a few days off.
The children have been fun.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider festival.
It was messy.
The average audience of 19 different ales took me to sample 19 different ales, with Wobbly Weasel being my personal favourite.
The mix of people there was quite interesting, it was not just CAMRA nerds (not to be confused with camera nerds of course).
The drive back Sunday was painful.
Monday night we went to my mates grandad's for a game of 9 card brag.
Some serious beginners luck saw me walk away with a decent couple of pots.
If I make it to 95 I'm as switched on as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks was served with a rash of bacon on top.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand to what extent you are making a mistake, dear Christian.
However, I believe you are moving a little away from the subject.
This famous totality prohibits search for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
It signals without delay trafficking in arms.
One either has large open eyes like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker, or one has large closed eyes.
A choice must be made.
It is not by keeping one's eyes closed that one steps into light.
Please, dear Christian, but again you make a monumental misinterpretation: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, have formally condemned El and his crimes, and the French, Muslim or not, have added to these official unanimous condemnations.
The person who does not say a word consents.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not as French.
However, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have repeatedly said, some have doubts about the approval by French Jews of the Israeli mass murders in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they publicly demonstrate to prove to the rest of the French society that they are wrong to doubt them.
This principle is, to my mind, the denying of the Republic and only contributes to a weakened French society.
If there is no doubt, one might as well say it.
The person who does not say a word consents to what?
Relationships to El or condemnation of El.
Silence is very helpful, it is the main weapon of those who want to please everyone.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically indefensible.
Salmond has predicted Scotland could “exact revenge” on the Westminster parties at the ballot box because a huge gap has opened between their proposals for devolution and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrised at the thought of losing all those Westminster seats...
Cameron must be laughing his ass off.
What kind of threat is that?
The Tories do not give shit about Scotland as they have no power base there.
They can do whatever they like with total electoral impunity.
Cameron is not stupid enough to believe that Labour losing Westminster seats to the SNP is good for him and the tories in the long run.
Who will share a tear for the Labour Party.
Scotland is going to face a total whip out from the SNP and UKIP breaking their neck up north.
When Ed Miliband sign up to the "VOW" he believed he was saving his party but could not understand he was signing off the death of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking questions of the Leader.
If the SNP win 20-25 seats in a hung parliament situation, even if the seats do not come from the Tories, they are in a very strong position in any coalition and threat to both the Tories and Labour in terms of making them do what they would have said about devo max.
Think that is more the point.
If Labour or the Tories ever want to get elected in England again.
Targeting up to 8% at the expense of the 85% is not good electoral strategy.
Plus once the Scottish MPs cannot vote on English matters the Tories will win every vote.
It is probably his.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Milliband surely has.
Maggie done it with the Ulster Unionists and it seems to work well.
It is still on course to be PM in 2015, and has been since he took the leadership of the Labour Party.
The firms will be virtually behind each reader to watch over their shoulder and see what they read, how they read, and up to the end.
This is "The Lives of Others from East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of CASH...
Still the same interest in surveillance techniques.
In the long term, that will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I am waiting for the next ticket: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and automatically thanks to a secret algorithm!
What a wonderful world.
Deeply stimulating.
Thank you for your article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I can only read pirated files, books from public domain or bought from some editors who have the intelligence to offer their files without a control device.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, there are no regrets.
I am shocked at the widespread abdication of users faced with widespread appropriation of their private life.
At your large public bookseller you will notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces, whose opening and finish times are probably derisory.
Examples include Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.
In the era of Big Data, data does not need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all literature in the same box.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The collection is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo which is, not allowing identifying the readers or the authors.
Kobo does really have this information.
The Turkish government has been so many over top, wrong and contradictory statements in recent days that it looks like it is run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic toddlers on acid.
It is worse than that when you factor in Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that he deletes your comment but not mine. ;-)
Turkey is not interested in shooting itself in the leg unless there is something in it for them.
If it shoots ISIS, ISIS will shoot back at it, so it is shooting itself in the leg.
The AP reported that Iran has warned the US that it would be mistaken in trying to topple the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad as that would risk Israel’s security.
It is unclear from the report whether Iran was giving a severe warning of retribution or counseling circumspection.
The most interesting thing is that the US-Iran diplomatic engagement today covers Syria, Israel and regional security.
Indian Punchline is highly recommended reading for anyone paying attention to detail as opposed to the BS pushed in certain streams of the MSM - the small piece you link is an important one and should be read in the same light as previous warnings/realist observations from Iran regarding Afghanistan in late 1979 - 1980's.
What are these 'moderates' fighting the terrible secular Assad simultaneously being ISIS ?
 Pipeline politics is driving the world over the edge and I would suggest these people referring to non-existent ' moderates' start looking at the fact and other options before packing other peoples kids off to fight WWIII.
There are other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I can think of one.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for Turkish genocide of Armenians.
There should be a 'should'?
Do you know that not only the perpetrators, nor any of the victims can still be alive?
It’s late, old chum...
Maybe they are a bit longer in tooth now, like maybe 120 years old?
It’s a bit late, no?
Crucially as regards the CUP triumvirate, Talaat and Djemaal were killed in the aftermath of WW1 in revenge assassinations by the Armenians, and Enver was shot in some unknown spot of Central Asia by the Bolsheviks when he was there on a strange mission to found a Turkic Empire ....
What a shame!
The remarkable mastery of the slippery slopes sophism, but apart from that, one does not search for contact with what is real.
Only false claims with no argument.
The fetus will always hear a heartbeat, even in the mother’s stomach.
Lesbian couples may simply wish to have children and not a wish to be accepted.
Sterile hetero couples also.
As for children!
What a disgrace to refer to them as future psychologically unbalanced people.
One day, they will be able to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay for the retirement of this woman (?)
GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that is occurring in the world.
It is not dated from today.
Many women have carried and brought into the world children who were not their husband's.
It is still like this, we are made like this...
The important point in the subject is that this practice is organized so that "commercialization" of the body is limited.
However, aesthetic surgery, cosmetics are not also commercialization of the body? !
Anakro-Fahreinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to get a maid pregnant in a country far away via internet and PayPal than to take responsibility or prevent the scandal in another century near your home without shouting it from the rooftops at that time!
This practice was not, furthermore, done in the name of the church!
There are not only Christians and believers who reject these practices.
The fact remains that body exploitation is a real problem.
The man has a passion for something.
I was only on the fringes of it in the late 70s in the Midlands.
I had to go to all dayers as I was not allowed to go to all nighters!
If you were in the music and you hear the music today it still moves you.
Why are so many sniffy comments down here about Paul Mason’s speech, maybe they are from folks who never were cool for a couple of years!
I think there are some football stories for you to comment on in the Sports section.
Top article, true.
Since the Tony Parson film, there has been a lack of coverage that really reflects the current state of Northern culture.
It is not a surprise that Paul Mason has got the social and political context right, he understands things.
Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampirised by capitalism, and is now largely a surface phenomenon.
Then you can dip your toe in it if you are in London in November - 99psoul will once again be spinning soul vinyl with lots of Northern on Saturday 15 November at Farringdon's Betsey Trotwood.
The same old story is also a good piece.
You really need to be more constructive in your criticism.
Top article.
Loved your documentary.
You are very glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and off at Wallgate.
Pop and pills.
Thought the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 Min walk to Wigan after buying a ticket to the stop after Victoria!
The early northern soul scene is depicted in an excellent episode of the George Gently detective series called Gently Northern Soul, set in Newcastle in 1968.
Something is growing more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
The truth is, Netanyahou never misses a chance to negotiate peace.
Jonathan: Netanyahou is not looking for peace, since he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (also, this was the case with Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their elected parties all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
Then he took off his clothes, put them down on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time!
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: now that things are clearly established, and now that things are clearly established, and now that things are clearly established,
Palestine and most of its population have no faith in the Palestinian authority's bipolar government and it will not drop its guard...
This displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, this is not the goal sought...
Anti-Zionist: But I answer you, I translate: the global geopolitical relationship...
It is still like this since politics have been globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it will continue!
For the creation of Israel you have not answered.
What power relationship allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a power relationship today!
Do you doubt that? ...
It is about much more than Russell Brand, but the Guardian's writers seem to struggle to get beyond what he has to say.
The most of what he says is ghostwritten sub-Chomskyian woo.
This shows you do not understand what Russell Brand is saying or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
The collection of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes him, implying it is to do with immaturity).
The really mean spirited attack, with a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is speaking some truth, maybe too much to think about.
Hold on your hat, there will be a lot more of this sentiment coming!
However, I can understand why Brand rubs some people up - can be pretentious in his delivery and after all the tabloid nonsense he does look like a johnny-come-late populist.
However, the general consensus seems to be that he is simply telling people not to vote and to ignore politics completely as both parties are basically ruling for vested interests, corporate multi-nationals and the wealthy.
While I am not saying I agree with his solution, I do not think politically active in terms of demanding can go hand in hand with voting as politicians are a fickle lot who will change their tune if they are voted out of office.
The solution is very debatable, and it would be nice if people could debate what he actually means, rather than just label him irresponsible and sideline the concerns that he and a large number of disenfranchised people have.
Yes - thank you.
The voting thing has been entirely misrepresented.
I very much regret the pointless placement of a cross on a paper every 5 years when my vote is not even bloody well counted.
I want more referenda on issues, voting by hole in wall technology, direct democracy and local MPs being locally accountable to the electoral representatives.
Also, I take issue with the suggestion that Russell Brand's words are not his own (ghostwritten).
The intelligence is sufficient to come up with his own words and ideas, even if they have been heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment, countercultural thinkers and academics that Suzanne would happily lump into one "sub-Chomskyian woo" box.
I'm pretty sure he'd get Suzanne onside in a conversation.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, get Suzanne to do a Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda with nodding responses edited in!
Like Max Keiser, who started out baiting Russel but ended up a fan, inviting him on his show, it's all too easy to attack him without really knowing what he is from.
The author takes a political narrative that has been developed through the generation but which has been marginalised by mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "rebellion" highlights the fact that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the History Meetings, where professional historians have become the minority and where exchanges among specialists have become poorer to the benefit of condensed ready-made thinking typical of Political Sciences for press releases.
Then I saw in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude, as well in Michel Foucault's, a need to target a culprit, a scapegoat.
The two develop very rational lines of argument, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats, which are the keystone of their thoughts.
I believe that for Foucault the State was essential as the culprit.
This is a very archaic way of thinking, sacrificial thinking, which is also magic thinking.
The problem with the relationship with other is resolved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing, neo-liberal and/or libertarian inclination (of two terms the second means a re-enforcement of the State’s desire to eliminate the State, the first knowing how to get help from the State for its deals) meaning less State / no State at all in Foucault.
The old dream of the base which does well organize itself.
The thinking is built on the culpability of the State: without this culpability it cannot survive.
Where there is a culprit, there is also elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not taking a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Nor support for that matter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, those of God back then, Stalin, the little father of the people.
ooh la la, you probably read too fast if you take Foucault's texts on Iran revolution for an apology for Khomeini.
Today even Pierre Manent would not enjoy attacking Michel any more in this way.
Gauchet presents a deep reflection about the modern individual and the group, on the difficulty posed by the mechanism for support in our liberal advanced societies.
If one agrees with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
The plot is orchestrated by human sciences researchers from the hard left who cannot bear that we do well without allegiance to their mantras.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people have no limits.
The important point to add is the position of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The attitudes I have seen in Russia towards Chinese and other yellows are absolutely jaw dropping.
You have not heard our Australian friends on that topic since.
Where in Russia was that, that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have personal opinion?
I forgot when I saw a Chinese last.
In London, and they were friendly to me when I learned I am Russian.
In Russia here - in 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese view of white people is similar!
My family has been living in Australia since coming over from Hong Kong and Guangzhou way back in mid-20th century and I still hear extreme anti-white opinions from some of them.
My dad is not happy that his youngest granddaughter is dating a white boy.
Also I believe that Russia has changed since 1990s and especially in recent years: they are becoming more prosperous, the prosperity is spreading outside major cities, and with that prosperity people are travelling overseas and seeing how others live.
The most common Russian prejudice has been against temporary untrained workers from Caucasus and Central Asia, working in occupations and living in areas where they are likely to be exploited by their employers or exposed to high levels of crime and violence.
Though I lived on the banks of Yenisey river, in Sibiria.
However, I have heard Australian opinions on both Chinese and Aborigonals.
It is very strange that a foreigner tells me that I cannot stand Chinese, when I have two in my life (once abroad), have no bad memory, people as people, and the London ones were very friendly.
Otherwise you cannot remember who you meet, people like people, how to remember who was who.
You know what’s strange?
The Chinese are talking about as a particular attraction, like a zoo exhibition.
And yet you still date this white boy.
How many Chinese men are with white women compared to white women?
None, because chances are the white parents of such daughters will physically assault them.
No measure for impartiality of justice.
It is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups that are very much left-leaning, such as the magistrates' union...
Marabout: sorry, but the judiciary sector is frankly right-leaning.
As for magistrates' union, it only represents 25% of judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be taken from the relativity of the enforcement of laws in the courts, it requires two obstacles to be removed.
The observer's political vision and the magistrate's fact-based interpreting.
It remains then the required tool of law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measurement of its non-observance in all magistrates' judicial proceedings, including the public prosecutor, requires distinction between error and partiality of magistrates.
It would be in vain to claim that justice is divided among these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance do not fall under an objective analysis.
If all this is not analyzed, how can it be claimed that justice is improving in France?
If it is only through statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low down.
The preceding preamble allows the following paragraph to include what follows in the third ratio.
The corruption of magistrates.
A sensitive subject proportionately to the power to cause harm* granted to the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The field of consideration is the spoliation of heirs committed even by fraud in the inheritance genealogists appointed by notaries.
This profession earns, in good or bad year, 150 million euros while benefiting from the cover* provided by the virtual judicial impunity* of the French notaries.
To understand their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments after the first publication.
The third link to the above mentioned statistical improvement is that the judiciary produced, during many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to have themselves spoliated in this way, a whole range of jurisprudence contrary to all the laws in favor of heirs.
Does the presentation of European statistics which ignores this rational criteria not then elaborate form of lying?
Absolutely awful prices certainly.
More rip off equipment for disabled people.
The mountain trike is built to his dimensions and weight and it has really opened up the outdoors in a way that normal wheelchairs cannot touch.
Beauty in the eye of the beholder and all that......
Tankchair looks like the sort of thing Jeremy Clarkson would come up with for a Top Gear challenge.
Tank Chair looks EPIC.
The Whill looks like it was designed by someone who has never cleaned dog poo out of wheel tread.
My sister would love the mountain trike but it is too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be good for a disabled person with a desire for longboarding.
We have hills here that would give them a thrill.
Prices do seem high but people send that sort of money on a bike, so "y'know".
I can see a case for the Mountain Trike.
Not all disabled people are poor.
Many have a reasonable insurance pay-out to use.
Only if they became Disabled.
The fact is that wheelchair market is a niche market, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.
The Whill could hardly be described as minimalist.
It is an example of over-designing.
However, it is only a concept design, with no plans for production.
The long distance wheelchair is not going into the market, as there seems to be no way to drive it.
Almost 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intense bombardments of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power in the Palestinian territories, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years old.
Children of eight years have lived all their life under the Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as this blockade inflicts "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
"Entrepreneurs who work on their projects divert a little cement to the black market".
This is not wood language, but the woman has a concrete and reinforced one...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti Zionist...
The good cement goes in the tunnels!
There is a black market, this is certain, and recognised.
Two million humans have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, unacceptable for anyone with heart and moral sense.
USA has a well kept site: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi was not given the necessary time to govern as dictatorship (supported by you know who) was excluded!
Remember that after removing him, Morsi reestablished the blockade!!!
And I am a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan ...
The Blockade is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the other side of the population which chose their masters!
Boats are a lot of work Aleks.
Hope you have thought this through.
Couchsurfing is way cooler than airbnb.
It is the definition of the non-for-profit sharing economy.
Many people after a bunkup with couch surfing.
So getting paid (or expected to get it) in another way.
It is still way cheaper than hotels if you have to scour for gems.
Also, landlords and tenants who trust each other often go off Airbnb and deal in cash, undercutting Airbnb.
How is that for community?
"Which she to lets on"?
No change to the verb, what happened to your grammar?
The verb "to allow" is not used in US.
The author was just using an American expression.
This is an international newspaper now, if you have not noticed.
Better get the correct insurance on the boat, make sure it is 100% safe, and seek permission from the canal and river trust to be a commercial trader (which they are unlikely to allow)
How do you consider that boats can be sailed away, stolen and repainted, sunk etc?
Canal boats are so slow that if someone stole it would still be within walking distance from where you left it.
Pirates or commanders...
All those Somali immigrants, coming over here, taking our canal boat ...
Where are you going to moor it?
No Marine Pen is right!
Populism?
There is no other truth than that which exposes the fact!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without qualifications.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
The die will be cast in 2017!
Capitalism is not going to become poorer!
High finance speculates, plays with our companies and therefore our jobs, with raw materials, therefore our purchases, our commodities, therefore our food, with care systems, therefore our health, with debt, therefore our institutions.
The threat to our daily life is arising from the same and our money which they have in their hands...
All that for a few hyper-mega-obese money grabbers.
In the case of FH, FH told FH that "my enemy has no name, no face, my enemy is finance".
This was 2012.
In 2014, he was appointed as minister for economy a former employee of Rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
There was no other competent person?
What do you call that: returning his jacket, dropping his trousers?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we do not know much about what Marine Le Pen believes.
How do you get that from?
The Germans refused to pick up any survivors.
However, I am not sure if Spee 'refused' to pick up survivors as such.
One aspect of the battle was that neither side appeared to be confident of the exact strength of their enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee left the area promptly because he received a report of a British battleship in the area.
The seas were stormy earlier in the day - not sure if this was still the case when the battle ended.
Equally, combat ended after dark, which would make any rescue operation more difficult.
Contrast this with the subsequent Falklands War, where survivors are picked up in a marsh-like sea and broad daylight.
Moreover, the rescuers knew there were no more German combatants in the area at that stage.
hmm, not how I remember what I read of the battle so I did a quick wiki:
The German ships were confused as to the fate of the two armored cruisers, which had disappeared into the dark after they ceased firing, and a hunt started.
Leipzig saw something going on, but on approaching found only wreckage.
Nürnberg—slower than other German ships—arrived late at the battle and saw Monmouth, listing and badly damaged but still moving.
After pointedly directing his searchlights at the ship's ensign, an invitation to surrender—which was declined—he opened fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without firm information, von Spee decided that Good Hope had escaped and called off the search at 22:15.
Following the reports that a British battleship was around, he turned north.
If that is accurate the Germans, flying around in the dark before radar, did not know that one ship had sunk and could not have searched for survivors from her.
The soldiers also believed that there was a bigger RN battleship in the area which could have caused them serious damage, so in confusion they left.
Their home was a long way from home and Spee was acutely aware that they had a lot of RN ships to get passed on the way.
Cradock's sacrifice had already done them great damage by soaking up about half their ammunition, dooming them when they were eventually caught.
The UMP is asking for it to be written in the law that a definitively sentenced elected representative is definitively ineligible as a result of this fact.
It is a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives from the left of course.
Noooo, it is a joke.
WITHIN THIS IDEA I SUGGEST A PLACEMENT ON THE MAGISTRATES' WALL OF CENTS.
When will unions be prohibited in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Political schemers whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to soften up the same people who will take advantage of their irremovability to hinder the actions of genuine politicians, who really try to get things moving, not the smooth talkers whose inaction is on the scale of their inadequacy.
They were on the metro around midday with little signs "money for justice" from the provinces and did not make the distinction between Bercy and the POPB.
She supports the existence of politicised unions whose members use the enormous power they have to serve their party.
The same theses would not be defended if right-wing unions, even from the extreme right, chose figures from their side as targets and would fight them legally and medialy.
Your submissions are totally free.
If the right is currently the main topic in legal developments, this is simply because it has committed acts which pertain to it!
There are no examples of figures from the left who have had so much to do with the Law, but all those who were the subject of its attention received preferential treatment.
The magistrates' union, which is left-wing, is not the only magistrates' union and it is a minority.
The minister should support the unions with such commitment shows how they can be helpful.
The union you cite may be a minority among magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancery, and this is not a secret.
The question now is if the "mission of some judges is more to smear than investigate.
- You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
Pivoine: you are forgetting that magistrates are not civil servants like others, they are the only ones to have the power to indict and to incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
How about having no contestants back?
Afternoon, Katie Waissel.
If even the most fame hungry jerk realizes that the X-Factor is a one way street to career oblivion, then I would be surprised if anybody take them up on the offer.
Many have used it as a launch pad to great success.
One Direction are currently selling out stadiums around the world.
Others have gone on to sell loads of records or moved to Westend.
The first prototype of it launched Chreyl Cole who is actually on the panel.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, and Cliff Richard all participated in the Eurovision Song Contest as many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the rest did talent competitions in USA.
In the 70s and 80s New Faces and Opportunity Knocks were most important to British TV's light entertainment stars.
Some have slipped into obscurity.
It happens to most stars who go on the non-talent show route anyway.
Some people who have a hit single go on to have others.
Most singers/bands can expect in any case three albums and a greatest hits.
However, Cole or whatever her name is now has a limited fanbase in the UK.
Some of her fame was borne by her marriage to a mouth-breathing footballer.
More people know in America know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
One way street to career oblivion is a one way street to career failure.
However, more chances of a career than the usual rock route, but in your illusion you may think every rock poser smoking weed in his dad's garage and bashing out 3 chords over some schoolboy poetry are guaranteed to be the Next Big Thing and all that's left is how big an advance he wants.
The most ridiculous thing is that this establishes a completely artificial distance between the western audience and the people studied – a distance that quickly becomes racism, because the sacralized ethnologists present these remote people as almost religious and filled with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired by practical daily considerations.
Unless you are unwisely interpreting in the opposite direction.
Very well, but rather than saying that the drum is lacking sacredness, is it better to admit that our Mariannes and our Molières do not have much sacredness either?
Our bias is like a reminder of seeing the sacred as a well-defined object and contained in the religious sphere.
Great article in any case.
It is ephemeral deco to fill the gap.
No more.
Superb article, thanks.
The recent burial of leading Republic figures in the Pantheon is an illustration of the sacred sentiment still remains.
Who still believes the interpretations of archaeologists!
Other disciplines would reject interpretations that are not scientific and last for a mandarin life, rarely less.
When will there be a comparative criticism of the disciplines so that we can laugh a little?
Because what is known for archeology also holds for other disciplines’ interpretations.
It would bring a beneficial dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is absolutely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to build History, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before archaeologists trusted their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be misunderstood.
Today we have technical and scientific means that interpret excavations is better but can still be questioned by other discoveries!
The shamanism controversy is a long and old controversy, which is being advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (see his book The shamans of prehistory, particularly the re-edition with scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches editions).
Thank you for this highly useful article.
Straight men are anal?
For you Mike I could be.
So it ́s over between us ?
I cannot see Why can't we go on as three?
This is a mature newspaper, for grown ups.
Do you really feel the need to descend to the level of the gutter?
No, but we are not against watching a play about it.
We would not watch a musical about it, though — that would be too gay!
Maybe we knew you would get this sort of comment from you.
Mary Whitehouse has appeared from her grave.
Maybe I suggest as your months trial is upon you you move on to the Catholic Times.
I am sure you will be more home.
He prefers mikedow.
Maybe we all need to find a newspaper that pays its brave, real journalists to report on the Middle East, Ebola etc at genuine personal risk.
Better than this sniggering, puerile bottom humour.
Not wise.
Run along then.
If you are so offended by 'peurile bottom humour' you do not have to participate, do you?
You know that this paper is today covering Middle East and Ebola and that it is absolutely possible to do both and publish a piece about anal sex?
It is the topic you either laugh with or that people laugh with it.
Nevertheless, the amateur video of the crash is found on the net...
Amateur video of net crash...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests, not the driver's.
If the FOM wanted to protect the drivers, it would have taken out the safety car at the moment when another vehicle (breakdown lorry) entered the circuit.
The effort was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon, which was known to be coming but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to extend the start time (television rights, adverts, money).
However, they protect the driver well.
Read it and I also share this opinion.
Then if the very British FOM makes the SC enter, it will allow Nico Rosberg at the start to have a chance of beating the Englishman, who was lead then...
Your really let go on this blog my dear Dayrton.
It does not matter, I have a little bit of time to clean out all your stupidities.
No, just no.
There are many conspiracies in F1, but never one that would threaten stewards with death for a remote story of the possibility of a victory of a driver to the detriment of another.
It is not the FOM that takes out the safety car, it is the FIA.
Significant difference.
Because of amateur images, the lack of images allows the FIA to avoid annoying questions such as:
No, it is not because the video is too violent that the FIA blocks the video of the accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can continue normally and that the yellow flag is no longer under the control of the yellow flag.
Some comments show dark ignorance of F1.
Yes Etienne, the race is no longer under the control of the yellow flag after the place of the accident, and the green flag is flown.
This is the normal procedure.
The stewards' post after the accident (depending on the case, this can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) is waving the green to tell the drivers to resume normal speed.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media were integral to the government's 'patriotic' propaganda offensive but I am afraid that in the end it's just money.
And sex, lets not forget sex, fear of not getting sex, adverts and the media are good at selling us things that may lead to better sex.
The news do the same thing.
Making things that the public really do not need to worry about and that's all about keeping people scared so they can remain controlable.
When the tabloids cook up an Ebola story, we all catch the fear.
Given the health connotations of the word 'cough', 'cough up' is a far more effective turn of phrase than 'cook up' in this context...
I wonder if all those people yelling that Ebola may become airborne now believe in evolution?
You are giving them too much credit.
They probably believe that it is the end of the world and ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Anti-Christ!
You are confusing ebola with murdoch....
Great article thanks!
A succinct piece that successfully and soundly ridicules this abhorrent pseudo journalism.
It gave me a good laugh.
It depresses me that most media report most things in this reverse positive way.
It is all about keeping fear and anxiety levels high (but below hysteria) so that the govt can tip you over the edge when they need it.
If we are to have a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any terrorist act, why not have an ebola crisis in the absence of any cases?
This government seems to want to save us from crises of their own invention.
What is there intrinsically wrong with a fear-based approach to government?
Congratulations for this post and for still being in the world for nearly 35 years.
In addition, at the start it must have been very ugly, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I am thrilled, living with the confidence of going through it for years...
A perfectly useful testimony.
Like whenever science is talked about.
Only do testimonials serve no good: taken alone, they cannot be used as scientific material.
Their influence is negative on the objective understanding of the fact.
@traffic: Testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
This is probably why one refrains from asking questions to psychiatric patients when one has reliable observations from close relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was trained telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say that it is nonsense, it is a subjective testimony without value.
Because certification of fact (= here this testimony, which proves contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is no purpose in scientific procedure?
What is your research based on?
On fantasies?
Do you place false theory and fact on the same level?
Resilience: the phony word adored by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading Deansembourg.
@Jim: There are many meaningless buzzwords in the brains.
Cyrulnik did the "resilience trick on us.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have knocked together a reliable measuring scale to measure it, the famous resilience.
Thunderbirds could save us all from farage and co.
Team America anyone?
Really, thunderbirds are not good to bring back...
Why on Earth not?
It was a wonderful series and it seems to be being brought back by people who recognise that!
Leave the saving to the Almighty who deals with miracles.
How are they going to make it successful with children?
I can only see them introducing toilet humour and like which will destroy it.
It was already a children's show.
It was popular with children.
Because it is a children's show?
UKIP are Mysteron agents.
Keep Team America.
Still available in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same without the visible strings and the nodding-dog head. :-)
Looking forward to this (even as a grown up), but I hope this also inspires one of the channel to re-run the originals.
It has virtually never been off the air in Australia - for at least 40 years we have had hour-long episodes on Saturdays & Sundays at 0600.
Since the advent of digital free-to-air TV a few years ago, it has been moved to one of the secondary commercial channels and still screens at those times.
The bonus is that half hour episodes are now on at 0530, Monday to Friday!
Yes, I am probably a "sad 60 year old bloke, but I do not watch it every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the mosque esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented it to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli excavations under and around the minaret for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentina?
This mount is not looked for because it is the hill on which the mosques were built.
The summit, or the dome of the Rock, is located in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mohammed went up to Heaven from this rock.
For Jews, it is the Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
From the moment it was taken and contextualised, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
They are always present in the government, and they unfortunately took over in the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the last rejected the 2-state plan and scrapped it continuously).
It is also to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful event.
How will God recognise his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "Praise be to God!"
To promote Israel to us, we are often shown half-dressed young nymphs, lying on the beach.
The reality is usually quite different from what the advertisement shows us, as can be seen in the photo which illustrates the article.
It is a bit scary all the same.
This photo is a wonderful propaganda campaign!
shame that the Reuters photographer did not take a photo of the hundreds of Palestinians authorised to go back to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone faithful Jews down below, praying at the wailing wall.
If this photo disturbs you, it has every right to do so, but it is not the newspaper nor the photographer that must be condemned.
This is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to end it is revolution.
Since the economy apparently went to shit big business has hugely taken advantage of their employees.
The workers have managed to convince them that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to be paid rises, while at the same time and in public sight they have awarded the elite few at the top a bigger and bigger rewards.
You are right it is not sustainable, but it will only end in this country when the working classes actually speak with one voice.
Better than bitch and moan about somebody else's industrial action, support it, show some solidarity and recognise that their action is not only dealing with their issues, but also shows your employer that there are consequences for taking the piss.
Not if we get rid of democracy, then it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only point you missed was how UK and US business sold our manufacturing and now our service jobs to countries with the worst, most polluting places with the cheapest most exploited workers.
China and India are always remembered.
There is no way this is going to end well.
It is because we do not have democracy that it has been sustained.
Did you vote TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is aimed at increasing the profits of the corporations that these people own by overriding national governments through secret courts.
It sounds unbelievable but it is exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) part of the deal is aimed at.
The Green party is against it and trying to alert people to the incredible devastation it will cause on our lives.
It is only now starting to appear in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement
Churchill called, Blood, Sweat and Tears?
This is indeed a good thing that does not drop off trees, whereas digital money does not drop off trees.
Next weak spot is likely to be the auto market.
This man is right, in 18th there were unions in all the regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave it (well, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) to believe that it is safe of France's eternal values, and it will fight and shut up.
Then with decline of country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of value, shortly the dissolution of the Nation, to have this small relic is comforting.
Even if for a while it gets more and more uncomfortable...
You still missing the union of married men, single men, married women, single women, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you do not write correctly, I will form a union.
You have been warned, it will be your fault.
For the defence of interest groups, we have already built sufficient protection professions equipped with unions, which caused a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are requested not to laugh about a civil servant's fear of risk.
The system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions or without the right to strike like in Germany, in exchange for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise catastrophe is ensured.
With the preparation of the charrettes, the government congratulates itself.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance. Sybille
If we remove "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.
Any worker contributing to the collective determination of working conditions and management of companies.
This is essential with the coming of information power.
However you open, probably read and then post on a specific article titled 'the great British bake off review'.
Look, it was just lying there, empty.
I thought it could do with a conversation starter.
It was Joffrey's wedding I watched - there was some top, top, top, top, top, baking action on that episode.
Joffrey's wedding episode features one of the most spectacular showstoppers (albeit misdirection - it was the wine) in TV history.
Also, mmm pie.
Game of Thrones!
GBBO is a wonderful combination!
Another final in row where strangely the least worst baker on the day seems to win - no - one seemed to go "bang - here's my big bastard of a cake now bang it in your mouth and bow to the best" !
The added pressure of friends and family outside finally gets to them.
In previous weeks all those outsiders have been kept away.
Plus there is the feeling of 'stay safe, there's always next week' which disappears on the last week.
I love baking but can't imagine going through this.
I remain grateful to this who do and who inspire us to try something different next time.
Roll on GBBO15!
I agree, last year’s final challenge, the wedding cake, was ludicrous.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they were expected to knock one together in 3-4 hours.
The three showstoppers were all so neck and neck I can't imagine how they could pick a winner.
Luis' bottom layer being a bit dry was the only real fault they found (though I agree with Hollywood that the lime green icing on Richard's windmill was a bit off putting, though Richard had already blown it by that point).
The challenge in this series has been a bit artificial because of time restrictions.
There is also cancer which lies in wait, with the gusts of solar wind.
We are certainly succeeding at everything at the moment.
A very bad moment for humanity to go through is expected.
You are mixing solar wind and ultraviolet rays up.
UV rays are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV rays.
If the magnetic field gets weaker, there would not be enough solar wind to "get rid" of stratospheric ozone.
There would be even more, and thus less UV and "cancers".
The ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have loads of useful functions that you cannot even imagine.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they are concerned with allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), heating us (except infrared), modulating our immune system and, it seems, improving our morals.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and most of UVB through.
Know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a backward person when you post a comment?
Above all for a minor clarification which was implied in the comment, which itself aims to show pedagogy.
With no evidence that I know melanomas well, UV rays only accelerate their development.
They do not CAUSE them.
As proof: all tanned people do not necessarily have melanomas.
Then, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in a cellar, you should not listen as UV rays are necessary for every human.
Exception is like everything: it kills.
Other reasons may be involved.
UV rays directly cause melanomas.
Does it bend?
More importantly, will it blend?
or blend...
The majority of the attention paying population have established, that anything will bend if sufficient force is applied to it.
I believe the military may require something more rugged and so has not adopted the iPhone6 yet as its frontline communication choice.
For the rest of us.
It is a good choice.
The majority of the attention paying population have established, that anything will bend if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except a Nokia 3310.
More to the point, is it already bent?
This joke is made every thread.
I have decided to keep count.
This is the fourth bend joke I have read in comments today.
It is difficult to see how a prototype can get anywhere near the distribution operation.
The special software is being installed, you would think the phone would be clear of the main production line, and it is difficult to imagine how it would get back into it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm................................
More likely it is a production unit that has not had the iOS software installed correctly and is stuck with the factory test code.
I have no idea how they make these things.
Would they have test software on every single one?
The photographs on ebay clearly show the absence of FCC/CE logo's and a red prototype connector.
Ahh the quintessential article for boos.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that factory-produced products are produced in factories.
To respond to your post, it is possible to eat well with a small salary.
Afterwards, everyone is free to set their priorities where they like.
Food is one of them.
OK then no hard feelings, I send you a kiss.
Bohos, or ecological bohos, are people who see the world through an ideological software program, which leads them to disconnect themselves from realities.
It is the full unbundling of thought-reason.
Their skills are in gesticulation, for example they claim to save the planet because they avoided having a shower.
Their hypocrisy is also a known source of hypocrisy, agreeing with the left, which sometimes comes, such as by rejecting CO2 emissions while vacationing in the Maldives.
The majority of our fellow citizens do not allow this mix of oafish ideology and hypocrisy, so do not be surprised if you often see criticism on them.
Thank you for this exhaustive and detailed theory and for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I would really like to be part of them, but I cannot find my way around them.
The concept is not that complicated.
Ecobohos are cast in one piece.
What is the concept of left liver?
Then you are in position to understand the eco-boho concept.
It is a perfect copy with just a political sensitivity.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists full stop.
Eco-boho is part of it, but only represents the most visible fringe of ecologists, as it is this one that infests the media.
You are having a giraffe.
However, no one can see the giraffe in the room.
It is so badly drawn that it loosely resembles a nude female.
Ssssh - you are not in on it.
You have to be part of the inner circle of the art world to understand the shocking honest beauty behind her work.
You are not qualified to make judgement, not having spent hundreds of years studying and sycophantly flirting with great artists.
The fact that Emin cannot draw and seems to be obsessed with the same subject matter is not the point.
The point is, she actually managed to make herself wealthy and famous on the back of no artistic ability.
That’s *art*.
That is FART.
The fact that Emin cannot draw is a cause for the fact that Emin cannot draw.
Not really a fact that one.
More opinion.
If you only have the capacity to appreciate lifelike recreations of smoking dogs playing pool.
There can be problems with the institution of art appreciation but not in this case.
Drawing encompasses more than mere representation.
If that is all you want then a camera will do.
The author even discusses Emin's expressionism.
Take another look and let the picture speak for itself - not as a comparison to the type of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why do you not do it?
There are still things to avoid: horse-riding activities, number of republican guard horses or status of generals who have no more active service...
Honesty forces them to say that France is reducing its strength, but like all countries, sometimes even more dramatically, starting with Great Britain.
It is only half encouraging...
The operational without support, that quickly reaches its limits!
A unique approach, when we observe the weaknesses, inadequacies of our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
The damage is a huge blow for the local communities, who lose a dimension of their activities, even a part of their history.
Where is the promised enshrinement?
edmond: that is what I was saying, look elsewhere or economize but above all not in my backyard, my backyard is really not possible...
This is exactly what you suggest, look elsewhere where chaos is certain.
All those who have more or less involved in the military thing can come and say face to face that no money is wasted in this area and without bursting out laughing...
If we apply the same potion to the whole civil service and the public finances will be a bit better.
For Josi: really irritating: look at the inflated public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why Defence may feel a little full!
Economics that everyone agrees to must be made, should be seen somewhere.
The lucky ones who are attacked by this murder, they mock the murder when it arrives at their house, poor dears.
This should be done, but especially as it does not attack me, in this case it is a crime and not an economy.
Gignols know!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local communities, history repeats itself with each post, maternity, hospital, barracks closure.
All are for course economics.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants to offset and not delight in the savings made in public spending.
This is literally the most mind-boggling article I have ever read!
The awkward moment when the first three commenters make the same bad joke.
The life sapping moment when you scroll down your Facebook feed and learn that 80% of your friends have started their posts with the phrase “That awkward moment”.
I gather there is now a film with that title.
It may be based on hilarious scenes involving people bumping into their ex's on bus and getting to work only to discover they have tucked their skirt into their pants.
It's not fucking awkward, it's brain-dead.
It sounds like the writer is playing the role of the usual British male brought up to downplay emotions and bite the lip.
If you're a Kate Bush fan, her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been an emotional event.
You realise your post is now being fought over, to be optioned?
I do not have the "internet".
It is not feels that I can comment.
No computer.
If I do not see I am going to die!
I cannot believe how incredible this article is!
Charlie has proved that he is at the very peak of the stellar universe of satirical journalism!
I swear at his feet!
This is my opportunity to share this to all my followers and friends on Facebook and Twitter and encourage them to the incredible inestimable and utterly utter brilliance that shines like a divine glow from Mr Brooker's keyboard.
God it was crap.
Especially when they are not women or transvestites.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution in democracies: the rise of regional policy and effective community initiatives.
In the future we will take away our right to save our planet by States who play the hypocrites at every meeting to save the planet.
We decide, citizens, to take control of things.
With the Commissioner who plants in energy, all these fine recommendations fade away...
You translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the roundabouts of tomorrow.
All funded by the taxpayer.
I ask you to stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful with regard to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nucleus electricity means zero CO2 emissions during production and epsilon for other stages.
Renewable wind or PV electricity already means more GHGs in other stages and above all gas or worse coal, like in Germany.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would be counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial, I am not insulting you. I have a State Doctorate in physical sciences 1981. In addition, I have done research on nuclear physics.
If I do not say anything about Germany, I have not replied to what I was saying and like all right-wingers I never destroy the interlocutor.
further I quote the conclusion of experts appointed by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is non-profitable and ineffective means to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
It is true, reminder: two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear plant leaves as water vapor and a little in the water of rivers.
Read after you referred Pakistan as "SOUTH ASIA GIANT"... !!
Pakistan won the last football series against Hindustan.
Why would you, most Indian Commenters just want to read and comment on something that is against Pakistan.
Shows your mentality by way.
The same thing would have been done if they called India as South Asian Giant...
I have no issues with individual Pakistani players playing but a Pakistani franchise is strictly a no-no.
It would open a pandora's box of corruption and underworld influences.
In the ISL, today's opening match was a surprisingly entertaining affair with Athletico de Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan has a very long way to go.
Comparing it to the vast billions India spends on IPL cricket and now football, how are we ever going to compete with our "noisy neighbors"?
The flight on low-cost launcher is paid in cash.
A shame for such a fine project.
In the incident, the potential design flaw only shows up with helium that is too cold.
It may not be a design flaw, but in the implementation...
While arianespace is a private company, soyouz is a Russian state-owned company...
If the rule is the same as here, the state is its own insurer...
Then they may be going to pay for the satellites in frigates, who knows.
The most regrettable thing is that many media outlets always go back over only the titles of articles - and many readers only remember the titles.
All in all, it creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
The title is not appropriate, it unjustly calls into question the project, while it is only a problem with the launcher.
