This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a well-known theory, but it also provides details that fossils can't usually provide, which are related to color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown at the top, with pale or yellow-orange-red underneath.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed feature called the larynx, but had other feather characteristics - spines and tiny spines - researchers concluded that the larynx was probably part of a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for temperature regulation or appearance.
The research showed that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not chicken feathers.
A car bomb detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

The lower the Rosby number, the less active the star is due to the inversions in its magnetic field.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to mimic Sagittarius' observations of the galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and thereby causes a tidal wave, so the Milky Way applies a force to the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is in a kind of halo, and it's made up of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa has discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
He said in an interview that the new variant is "very problematic and alarming due to its high mortality rate".
Dr. Moll thinks some of the patients may have contracted the bug at the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital health workers.

Voting in France is done without technology, with voters isolating themselves in a booth and putting a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope to mark the candidate they're voting for.
After the officials confirm the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.

Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

She's in custody pending indictment and trial, but any witness evidence can be rejected because her picture has been published many times.
This is standard practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently and the courts have considered it possible that the publication of the photo could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are really walking a fine line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is fully in charge of prosecutions, has informed reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until charges are brought.
The document will, according to leaked information, relate to a border dispute that the Palestinians want to base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, which is a problem in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA accepts a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test program were to be under the watchful eye of the ranger, as the test program was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, in line with the Sport Shooting Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), nine members were sworn in before Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed that the former CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
At times violent protests have been triggered over the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, causing a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had information on 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company says is "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (Friday 09:19 pm GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office has announced that no damage has been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no tsunami indicators.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six are confirmed dead.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children, elderly and photographers from the Philippines.
Photographers later took over the old lady's place when she needed a bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the State Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While he was working at Liggins Hospital, he spent his spare time researching preterm birth.
His research showed that the introduction of hormones will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday that recorded data during the flight.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and that Luna passed away on the night of her second birthday, quite unique, just like her, a strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented "The moon was as strange as I was...maybe even more...I love her and I will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of the transitional government claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This view is shared by 34 percent of those polled who want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The poll showed two types of extreme views: 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to an appeal.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to relieve the pain because those drugs were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February using various hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water to Earth along with the organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets hit the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors political chatter and nonsense.
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually while also reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be involved and no overhead trains will stop at Wembley, and car and bus transfer parking is not available near the stadium.
Fear of lack of transportation has increased the likelihood that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science has made claims of a new species of bird forming on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza forte, and the migratory cactus frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made in many shapes, it can be wrapped into small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin wire that can be wrapped and twisted, it can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of a chemical substance, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, and then make a ball of them with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and create a kind of protection.
In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every home had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of a sewage system have been found in houses in mining towns on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes parts of public baths where men and women lived together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who's miles away, use satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To place a satellite or telescope in space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, but the most important thing it has provided us is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special skill that each cat possesses and that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats and live in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three adult males in the genus and up to 30 females and young.
Women are usually very close to each other because they are a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
Like a true pro wrestler, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of angry words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds.
Scientists think that ocelots track and locate prey by scent by sniffing the soil on which the animals have been found.
They have very good night vision in the dark and they move very quietly, and they hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then they jump on the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example, when crossing over a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the environment they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, to represent a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptation than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they still need adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like another population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that people breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce food by photosynthesis using the sun.
We build houses and make clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of his time, he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra row on the roof of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for any creature that came in its way.
We don't know for sure, but she may have had a crooked tongue, her diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was out of his league.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also feasted on some strange or unusual food, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a species of rodent called puff.
The other difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have banquets together where they would slouch on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their deities, which they considered to be the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place in the open air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open cashiers facing the street.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so the wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large document on parchment (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally encased and placed in an archive.
So it's possible that the note was added simply as a label.
The Normandy landings (D-Day) and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
Northern France was ruled by the French Vichy, who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, and the attack was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French liberated the south of France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and it refers to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which in a way also defines the size of society.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a long-lasting cultural trace and equitable expansion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
Under the Articles of Confederation, during the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, whose only component was Congress.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and with no national executive or judiciary, it relied on government agencies that often did not cooperate to enforce the acts.
He also had no authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Members sought the full consent of all states before they could be changed, and states understood the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called the archipelago from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a change in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
In Machu Picchu there are three main buildings - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1976, and the restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, the display format has been copied into the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing - 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, the ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of the whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in the picture.
It is stated that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, found itself under control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their different languages and customs.
Her dominant power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds should serve that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and because of this concentration of power and money many question whether this rule is being followed.
Soon after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated internationally accepted law codified in several international treaties from the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to ships of neutral nations.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited warfare under the sea.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and crimes of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he took a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods, and each stage in Chinese history or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
The period between each dynasty also represented a period of divided provinces, the most famous such period being the Three Kingdoms Era which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the top spot in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of ranking by class, now it's ranked by caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working class peoples in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (the light) and meditated.
The cave itself, which has survived the ages, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen but clear, beautiful skies and numerous mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still in existence today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to a series of pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward-shaped symbol looks like a V, and the downward-shaped symbol looks like a junction or a square with no bottom.
Up means you need to start at the top and push the barbell, and down means you need to start at the frog (where your hand holds the barbell) and pull the barbell.
The upward roar usually produces a softer sound, while the downward roar is louder and more declarative.
Feel free to write your own markings in pencil, but remember that the printed markings on the string are for the purpose of music and should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats to the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriages wide open.
At one point, a Mafia member waved his head at a member of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds that were issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits that come from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent a basic gain for US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the founding of the Order.
The period in which these events occurred is usually called the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic related to the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has effects on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the country's road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, which is why new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to more road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with these geographical areas emerged and they, in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renowned epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more prized than anything the Byzantine market had to offer.
At that time, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The way of dressing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was when people started using buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture whose goal is to produce enough food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds from a particular eco-region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient in agricultural production, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with the same worldview who feel that social norms ignore them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be recognized by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often show their belonging through specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to several unfortunate cases of children whose developmental adults did not allow socialization due to neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse.
Some wild children were imprisoned (usually by their parents); in some cases, children were rejected because their parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical deficiencies.
Abandoned children may have gone through violence or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals, some thought to have lived alone in the wild.
After being fully raised by nonhuman animals, a feral child shows behavior (within physical limits) that is completely similar to the behavior of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is meant to make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Scaffolding (support) is not a learning method, but an aid that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is one form of help but also the little man who is the connector in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scales are embedded in software and are intended to interrogate, direct and explain procedures that might be challenging for a student to perform independently.
Children enter the foster system for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where there is no care, tenderness and education, but it happens.
We believe the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care should meet any needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access to benefits and satisfaction of needs.
For example, learning and socialization are considered important motives for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "continuous connections" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it can be detected whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work, The Presidential Address, suggested that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly judge honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior could be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century pointed to the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection is removal from a group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations between these two bases in each generation.
A primate with a digestive system like humans, in the savannah, it can be difficult to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources available would be proteins available in leaves and pulses, but they're hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a huge amount of protein that contains essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without completely waking you.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve taking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea which is a known diuretic) before bed, which will cause the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is the opposite of the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force present, and each person has the potential to find their own absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of total love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga, and through visualization of the different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had now become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Poland's defenses were already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were virtually obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after the invasion of eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of goods and large numbers of people across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to make sure that a country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while also impeding the ability of the enemy to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to provide aid to Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was using mostly U-boats to try to stop this trade.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as they conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started to breed them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other grazing areas, often by goats, usually children or adolescents, similar to today's shepherd.
Wagons were manufactured in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to reach higher speeds and to pull more loads than was the case on the somewhat more uneven roads of the time.
Railroad thresholds were introduced fairly early to fix the tracks, however, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be much more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels.
The first known means of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not used to walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been observed in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
Clearly, the world has changed considerably because of mankind's scientific and technological advances and because of the problems that have been exacerbated by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap Printing House.
Between 150 and 200 specimens were made in one night, known today as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8, in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap posters that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have chandelier feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encrypted in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common bed bugs are grim, adapted to life in their host's nest or living facility.
There are about 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it's not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can make the decision to make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine the way the world works by the scientific method.
However, it is not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, but also asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in a wide range of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Your body clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps going even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labelled DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or they labelled the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of a particular piece of genetic material and whether the affected germ cells are embryos.
Only embryonic cell mutations can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of their small towns on the outskirts and go to their jobs, passing by those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive, a transportation system that's based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high-carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave fairly consistently, so traffic has some kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, links have been established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't spread their wings backwards today are fairy horses and water lilies.
Over thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but most believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the earth.
Sounds reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and also the largest river on Earth, and it has more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the river into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 kilometers long and it collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical perfection of construction.
The new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors who were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of the country's employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in a period at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pencil has fallen into a lower status and is rarely used.
People now type messages on computers and never have to buy a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing heavy carts up a hill, but the re-splitting of the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulus.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
He's thinner under the sea, but thicker under the mountains.
On the near side, there may be more lava because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what drives people to behave or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have grown over time as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks and demanding responsibility from employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he or she must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, it is the leader who ultimately bears responsibility for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often results in a disagreement between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet there are small differences.
Virtual team members often function as the contact point for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of the virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is a management team to which each member is responsible.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and genius can emerge.
As a result, the process of the organisation in which it collaborates to overcome the barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
Advances in new technologies allow us to observe and explore brain structures and processes never before seen.
It gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction context, it represents an extremely important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence (AI) involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and sequencing, the ability to provide answers to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that are focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and are also embedded in several home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual excursions, where students can view artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual travel is also a great way to reflect on your journey and share experiences with prospective students.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and that website changes every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging forces students to become more aware of the world around them. The need to uplift the audience's interests inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others write and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city and home to a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which became especially established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female passengers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It might help if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider harassment and it's not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (no matter the cultural differences, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Baja, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading bases in the area.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old town of Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as sorghum, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of geomatics, but these are all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by a lion from Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially downtown.
While Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This town is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo Volcano with one of the cheapest mountain gorilla climbs in Africa.
You can use a boda-bod (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
Because of the fact that it is quite inaccessible, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport have made it a popular destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS special Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the leading South African National Park (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily fees for protection and entrance.
It may be useful to buy a Wild Card to enter some parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider a prime point of visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the outline of Hong Kong is linked to a brilliant graphic that is visible thanks to the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon Harbour on the other side.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is densely settled on land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonizers took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, you can start here.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the backwaters of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Yet, forests are not just salt marshes - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which almost one third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that about 400 royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 colorful deer live in the area today.
Buses leave from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 hours.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxi travel is a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous community in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and self-sufficient farmers.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who survived on hunting, fruit gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India", was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors met with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
In December, the largest annual tournament is held at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Here and at any time of the year you can watch small tournaments and games.
For news on tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo matches, check with Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, cash can be exchanged at the only bank in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in remote islands, although British and United States currency may be accepted; check with owners in advance which payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there when the northern hemisphere is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical climate; temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
In winter they can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but due to a combination of wind and humidity, it seems colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no separate rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to encounters with humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials require you to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
Despite their seemingly obedient appearance, bison, moose, moose, bear and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep the proper distance.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking smelling food products and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous 1889 naval stalemate when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town ended with the assassination of the supreme leader of Tupou Tamasese, Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland borders two ports.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe to swim on, and many get their cool from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the upper Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs of Central Auckland.
It's sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops that provide shore-side swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number 1, and it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There's plenty of French wine to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're scared, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea is straight white coffee side, short black espresso, lots of topping (not foam) on the cappuccino, and tea without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
There are year-round trips to the reef, and reef injuries are rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all the signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
The cubomondes appear near the beach and river mouth from October to April, north of the city of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles don't live permanently in the ocean, their primary habitat is the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind because he knows that he will have accommodations once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can see that other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can be booked through the agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can keep your reservation if you want to consider the offer or obtain other documents needed to travel to that destination (e.g. a visa).
Any changes or requests should be made to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors find this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to take a campsite near the music.
Please note that although the music content on the main stages is complete, some parts of the festival may be playing music late into the night.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin position because crossing the ice causes a terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the money and time spent by guests.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep guests in good spirits and keep them in the facilities.
Alcohol is served on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all experienced gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitude or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and it's not possible to drive like on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall very quickly to get you stuck.
Visibility may be limited by snow falling or thunderstorms or condensation or ice appearing on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow largely unimpeded year-round.
Safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling by land to see the stunning African wilderness, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars and standard equipment will give you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better if you look through binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as a bushwalk, safari hike, or hiking) consists of a hike of several hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some sporting events being held at other venues throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics since it hosted in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most cancellation policies caused by the coronavirus do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with standard tickets priced at around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can speed drying, and many hotels offer an iron and a board, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Make sure that the fabric does not overheat (which can cause clumping or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to treat water, some more effective depending on the specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water is enough for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have not seen in their own lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, an allergic reaction, spread poison or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill humans, are not usually classified as pests.
Shopping in duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmount has the most challenging conditions for traveling on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as the road often passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your cool: The road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and steep curves.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, cell phone reception here is much stronger than many other sections of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those made by their southern neighbours, the Austrians.
Fruit cakes are common - apples are baked in the dough year-round, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts. Popular cookies often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try a pastry that, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a plant-based and spice-based dish, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisine that is present throughout the nation.
But when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, contains a range of simply spicy dishes.
The uzengi are the support for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and his foot remains in the stirrup, the horse may pull him back in case he starts to run away.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with flat heels and fairly narrow soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety levers that allow the leather straps to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls them in the fall.
The Cochamó Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Josemite of South America - is home to various large granite walls and crevices.
The climbs include a breathtaking view from the peaks, as climbers from all over the world constantly find new routes through its endless potential walls.
Snow sports that involve downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you descend a snow-covered terrain on skis or boards that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity of many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski nerds", who plan entire vacations in terms of skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski-touring or ski hiking.
It is associated with alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but does not usually include them, with the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring many hard skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a trail that's similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover longer distances than you can by walking, but you will rarely reach skiing speeds without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, and under standard circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean going through multiple visa and passport control procedures.
However, the Schengen area in this respect, acts as one country.
As long as you're in this zone, you can cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is antique, but some tax agencies define it as being over 100 years old.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade goods could be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami, and a culture of trade is important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sami were involved in reindeer herding on a large scale, but lived off fishing, hunting and similar activities, and reindeer were mainly raised as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern trade, and tourism is an important source of income in Sámi-inhabited Sápmi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma populations, the word Gypsy is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes the subject of a travel warning, this may affect your travel insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You can consult and advise governments that are not yours, but their advice is meant for their own citizens.
One example is the fact that American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The councils are merely a summary of the political situation in a given country.
The views expressed are often short, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Storm is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Weather disasters can happen anywhere in the world, and they can be of different kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
