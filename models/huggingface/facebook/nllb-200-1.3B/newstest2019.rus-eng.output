The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass
Official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic (LNR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to the Donbass.
According to him, Kiev is planning to "somehow complement the units".
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass dismissals led to low staffing of the units", Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the actual numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later changed to the joint forces operation (JSO).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to an increase in the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated due to the murder of the head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities classified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were arrested.
According to preliminary reports, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian intelligence.

American businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of the Tesla company he founded at the request of the US authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission , the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million .
According to CNBC, the pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to remain in the leadership position at Tesla.
He is required to pay $20 million and step down as chairman of the board of directors within 45 days of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It's been clarified that the settlement still needs to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Musk of misleading shareholders by stating that he had sufficient funds to buy back the company's shares and had sued the entrepreneur.
It's about a businessman's Twitter post where he said he wanted to buy Tesla shares for $420 apiece, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company's stock has risen by almost 11%.
British Foreign Minister compared the EU to the Soviet Union and a prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member states.
The diplomat made the statement at the ruling Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to believing in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union wouldn't let anyone leave.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave will not diminish, but only grow, and we will not be the only prisoners who want to escape from captivity", the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union will only worsen the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Brexit negotiations were at a standstill.
This is how she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The decision to leave was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The UK's exit is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on the issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The Irish border remains open.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in received two puppies as a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after a visit to Pyongyang.
This is reported by Reuters, citing a representative of the South Korean presidential administration.
"A pair of Phunsan dogs were presented as a gift during the summit.
They were received on Thursday", the department said.
The dogs were given a few kilograms of food for about a year, "as an aid to their adaptation".
The gift was made in honor of the inter-Korean summit, which took place from September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.
The hunter-gatherer Phunsan is a North Korean wolf and got its name from one of the districts of the DPRK.
Moon is a dog lover, and has two dogs that were given to him by former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Dogs aren't the only gift.
Kim Jong-un also gave his colleague two tons of the delicacy Matsutakae mushroom.
He ordered the mushrooms to be distributed to family members who were separated during the Korean War and who had not yet reunited with their relatives from the DPRK.
Altai village council leader stops hunger strike to protect people
The MP said on his Facebook page that he had stopped starving for several reasons.
The village council chief said the situation was deadlocked, the district administration was not responding to his demands, and he needed to do his job.
In addition, the prosecutor's office has begun to check the situation, and the heat supply organization of the STPK has promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating period of the Siberian village next week.
The villagers also made a mass collective appeal to the Governor of the Altai Territory, "concerning the catastrophic situation".
Boronin himself said he felt normal, and he fulfilled his duties as head during the hunger strike.
As explained by Boronin, the settlements of Sibirsky and Rogulichny have centralized heating systems, which means that the authority to prepare them for winter should be fulfilled by the administration of the First May district.
But so far, no one has started this work.
The head of the village also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai Territory and against the financial policy of the company "Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk".
Besides the proper preparation of the villages for winter, Boronin demanded "immediately organize on the territory of the municipality a full-fledged independent plot of communal economy with the corresponding state units".
Moscow 's new buildings with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand new housing units were purchased in Moscow, ranging in size from 30 square meters and costing up to four million rubles.
More than half of these transactions have fallen on two residential companies, according to the materials of the Urbanus portal (is at the disposal of "Lenta.ru").

Telegram users complained about a glitch in the new version
iPhone users have complained about problems with Telegram after the update on September 28.
You can tell the user's phone number by his username.
The complaints concern gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.

The messenger's representatives have responded to the malfunction.
They said the problem could be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic updates until the issue is resolved.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor about the blocking of the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the telecommunications companies began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the messenger administration to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user if it received a court order.
Telegram audience shrank by 1.2 million after blocking

Elon Musk has been forced to resign as Tesla's board chairman
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the network, Musk will have to step down as Tesla's board chairman as part of the deal.
The commission allowed Musk to remain Tesla's CEO.
The Tesla founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be charged to Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American businessman who is listed among the 50 richest people on the planet by Forbes magazine.
He is the CEO of SpaceX, the Neuralink neurotechnology company, and the developer of the Tesla electric car, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buy-out.
Last month, Musk announced plans to take Tesla private and buy all of its shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 price tag was set allegedly "because of the significance of this number in the marijuana culture", Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the commission's security department co-director, Stephen Paikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he found the fraud charges unfounded, adding that he was very disappointed and saddened by the claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way", the businessman told CNBC in an interview.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had cost them.
In particular, one shareholder claimed that the businessman's tweets were misleading, forcing Tesla stock sellers to buy securities at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk's careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk also accused the head of research company Citron Research of stock fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk couldn't settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he could face removal from the company's board and even prison.
This was stated by former commission chairman Harvey Pitt, in particular, to CNBC.
Musk is "a good guy who can't run a car company".

The Russian Orthodox Church compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations (OCB) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Ilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Ilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible church schism and its political undercurrent
He said that now, when "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage", renaming the church is like "sticking a yellow six-pointed star on the Jews" in Nazi Germany.
"It means marking the church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this purpose", the representative of the ROC said in the broadcast of the TV channel "Russia 24".
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, since "the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country".
The UOC has called on the Constantinople exarchs to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: the anshlag, the Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Russia could have its own racing car within the next decade.
This was stated by the Vice-Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak, summing up the meeting with Russian car manufacturers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared his opinion on the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian Formula 1 stage.
The result of our meeting with the car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of the Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to stimulate our carmakers in this direction.
We were talking about plans until 2024, but I don't think that's possible in this time frame.
I think the more realistic timeline is within the next 10 years".
From 2012 to 2014 the team "Marusia" competed in the "Formula-1" under the Russian license.
According to the Vice-Prime Minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a national team in the world championship in the class of "Formula-1".
I know that in Russia there are fans of motorsport, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team", he noted.
"We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came about partly because of the infrastructure in Sochi".
Tomorrow the Sochi Autodrome is going to have a match.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even at the qualifying, the stands were almost full, - the Vice Prime Minister noted.
I can tell you that revenue is up 72% this year compared to last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of Sochi Autodrome infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will give Sochi even greater attractiveness.
Dmitry Kozak did not miss the main topic of the day for Russian sports fans - the return of Daniel Kvyat to "Toro Rosso".
We congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, - said the Deputy Prime Minister to "Izvestia".
He's a very promising driver.
Next year, for the first time in history, two major Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton.
Although the further fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the "Royal races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams expires at the end of the season, and the results are not impressive yet: he took 18th place in the qualification of the Russian Grand Prix.
We hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the modern antibiotic era, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, extracting penicillin from mould was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, he had a cold and had sown mucus from his nose on a Petri dish (a glass lid used to test bacteria) and found that the bacteria had been destroyed in a few days.
They also discovered penicillin almost by accident.
Fleming's name was included in the list of 100 most outstanding personalities in human history.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine has begun to deal with most of the ancient diseases that were previously thought to be incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers reported: "He has done more than a dozen divisions for the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France".
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were interred in the famous St Paul's Cathedral in London.
By the way, my wife and I were brought to this attention by a Russian-speaking tour guide.
And then a few years later, we saw a full-size statue of Alexander Fleming in the most unexpected place in the Spanish capital.
There, next to the main arena for the torrides, Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man whose efforts saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of the torrides.
By the way, this, I think, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all about this.

Google will pay Apple $9 billion for the default search engine
Google will pay $9 billion to remain the default search engine in Apple's Safari.
According to Business Insider, next year the payments will rise to $12 billion.
Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.
The annual fee is calculated based on how many Google searches were made from Siri and Safari on iOS devices.
Analysts say it's not profitable for Google to give up its default search engine status, as Apple is one of the largest sources of traffic for the search engine.
In early August, Apple became the first U.S. company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization.
Earlier reports showed that the corporation's net profit in the third quarter rose 32% compared to the same period in 2017, reaching $11.5 billion.

Trump spoke about being "in love" with Kim Jong-un
From mutual brutality, the leaders of the United States and North Korea have almost fallen in love, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump has made a good joke about his successes on the North Korean crisis front.
Starting with mutual threats of annihilation, the leaders of the two countries have now so straightened out their relationship that they're almost in love with each other, the American president said.
The White House host recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem as the main foreign policy challenge from the previous administration.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so launched relations with North Korea that they couldn't even reach the country's leadership - they simply didn't pick up the phone.
Then the U.S. and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "wonderful letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that he was "cruel" to Kim Jong-un at the beginning of his tenure, which was reciprocal.
But now their relationship has improved to the point where the leaders "fell in love".
Trump asked that his words not be taken literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is closing military training grounds.
All the credit for his administration, the American president is confident.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly about Kim Jong-un from the podium of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps to de-escalate tensions.
Trump said sanctions against North Korea would remain in place until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
The negotiations in Singapore
On June 12, the first ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore.
After a serious escalation of relations and mutual threats of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
The parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute, although they did not take any legal obligations.
The positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers who were in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards denuclearization of North Korea are still pending.
Media reports said that after the Singapore summit, the US had sent North Korea several disarmament scenarios, but Pyongyang rejected them as "gangster-like".
Volgograders have squeezed the mustard oil themselves

Nitsai called for the "Ukrainian language" to be replaced
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the mother tongue Larisa Nitsai called for the expulsion of "the Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language" from Ukraine.
She offers to do this with a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught".
Nitsai shared her thoughts on the "opportunity of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Obozrevalet".
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is being prepared now - it even exists and continues to develop further.
She is convinced that the Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language" in time.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, Russian was widely used on television and radio, but it has virtually disappeared in public.
At the same time, according to Nicoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities, which prohibit the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expansion of the borders for the Ukrainian language at the legislative level".
Previously, she shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, one of which had a cashier who spoke to her in Russian.
When he didn't get his way, Nizzai threw a handshake at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "linguistic schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing their surnames.
Recently, Nitsai said that the name "Rus" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscovia.
The writer's anger was not escaped even by the Security Service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the staff talking to each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, banging on the door.
We had a man-to-man chat at the break, and it paid off.
Defender of the "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Dennis, what do you think was the reason for the victory?"
"I think we wanted to win more", Kulakov was quoted as saying by the official website of the Ural.
"The game was so difficult, we had a serious conversation between the men at the break, and it paid off: we scored two goals and didn't miss.
"You've missed a few games because of an injury you sustained earlier this month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you can last 90 minutes, you're good!
I was actually feeling good.
Maybe save a little energy at the end so nothing happens.
So, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which I thank them very much!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret that after victories, it's easier to recover and the mood in the team is good.
We've got a white strip now, although it was black before.
We have to keep going and keep the fans happy".
"Missed the game for the time you were off the field?"
"There's this, a little bit of a miss, because really, a nasty situation came up.
But again, thank you to the physical therapist and the doctors for getting me back on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
Everything else is secondary".

In Macedonia , the referendum was marred by violations
Four incidents related to violations of electoral law were recorded in the Republic of Macedonia during a referendum on the intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelowski.
Since the election was opened, four incidents have been recorded and have been eliminated, he said.

The ministry said that all violations are being investigated.
"The ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can peacefully exercise their constitutional right to freely express their will.
We urge citizens to respect the law and refrain from any violation of public order and peace and any violation of the secrecy of voting", the Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Citizens in the referendum on Sunday are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is meant to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic on June 17 during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Prespa Lake, which marks the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
This treaty should not only resolve the long-standing dispute over the country's name, but also open Skopje's way to NATO and the EU.

This is the opinion expressed by the head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry, Walid Muallem, in an interview with RT television, which aired on Sunday.

The Syrian Foreign Minister also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive, not an offensive system, and is designed to protect the Syrian skies.

The charge against the Dagestan deputy is news
The Makhachkala Soviet District Court has detained for two months the deputy of the People's Assembly of Dagestan, Rajhab Abdulatipov, suspected of participation in a criminal community that issued a disability for bribes.
"Kommersant" became known details of the investigative materials, shedding light on how, according to the version of the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramadan Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, contributed to the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Bureau of medical and social expertise, Magomed Makhachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the operational-search activities carried out by the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev as the head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
Recall that earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other heads and employees of the territorial medical-social examination bureaus, which are under his control, was initiated a criminal case under article 210 (creating a criminal community using the official position and participating in it), article 290 (obtaining bribes by an organized group), article 292 (service forgery) and article 159 (fraud in a particularly large amount) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

While in the post of head of the Russian Federal Migration Service's department for Dagestan and having connections in state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as using his kinship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the investigators believe, "provided for the activities of other participants of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his being in the position of head of the federal state institution "Main Bureau of medical-social examination for the Republic of Dagestan", organized the illegal establishment of disabilities to citizens".
After the information was released at the meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov denied the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being brought against me today is new to me, I am not familiar with it at all", he said.
The court arrested the deputy from "United Russia" not ten days before the indictment, as it was with the previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months, because in his case there is article 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the investigation has much longer time to press charges - up to 45 days from the time of arrest.

Kosachev: Russia was virtually absent at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly
The head of the Federation Council's committee on international affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not rule out that it could become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we've become almost accustomed to in recent years about Russia has now been a bit more muted", the senator said in an interview published Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, Russia was often "identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this list, at least in the exposition of a group of Western countries, which was quite unanimous on this matter".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was almost absent".
"If you look at the US president, the French president, the German foreign minister, I'm not looking at Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least the chorus wasn't exactly right", the politician said, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall to be trained on with a tennis ball".
The head of the relevant committee of the Fed does not rule out that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although in full this trend may be manifested in a year, two, three".
"I do not exclude that this session could be a turning point in some sense", Kosachev said, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's involvement can move forward in international affairs".
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as examples.
"Unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of today".
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we are passing a point somewhere where the movement is no longer going to be a backward movement, it will be a forward movement", he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context, Kosachev called "a request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in general, nobody was interested, then the situation is different now", the Chairman of the Fed Committee said.
He believes that this is because "the so-called new liberal order, which is the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems because of the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, the problems of migration".
"And here the request for Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious", - said Kosachev, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

Bottas is on the sidelines, probably looking upset.
Damascus has declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the head of the Syrian Arab Republic's Foreign Ministry, Walid Muallem.
And he says Syria has a right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawal of militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports "RIA Novosti".
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in the event of the Kurds' aspiration to separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted by the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.
Terry has been appointed Chelsea's youth team manager.
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating a move to Moscow's "Spartac".
According to RT, citing Mirror, former England captain John Terry has taken charge of Chelsea's youth team.
According to the source, the famous player, who has been in the London club for a long time, will lead the team at the age of 23.
Terry is set to replace Jody Morris, who has left for Derby County.
In September, Terry was close to joining Spartak Moscow, but ultimately dropped the idea after talking with his family.
The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the convicted in Russia for "spying" the Ukrainian journalist Roman Suchenko for the fact that he still could not be released from prison.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, an action is taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, where participants have declared a hunger strike demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, go on hunger strike in support of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", - said Geratchenko.
She also expressed confidence that the trials will harden every Ukrainian, making us "worse, tougher in protecting Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
Recall that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 in Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Central Intelligence Agency.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow city court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legitimate.
Russian prison guards have granted the last request of the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.
NASA has reported a Big Ben-sized asteroid approaching Earth .
The American space agency NASA has reported that a large asteroid SP1 is approaching the Earth, which can reach 160 meters in length.
According to the Daily Express, the object may be taller than the famous Big Ben or the London observation wheel.

SP1's speed is about 60,000 km/h. The shortest distance between the asteroid and Earth will be on October 3.
Then it will fly past our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million kilometers.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19.
NASA has classified it as a near-Earth object.
Earlier, on September 27, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency released the first ever video from the surface of the asteroid Ryugu.
Two Japanese rovers (planetary rovers) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe captured unique images.
Bast blamed for ruining the football field at the 2018 World Cup
The damage to the football lawn at the Rostov-on-Don stadium was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.
The photo was posted on hd7tv's Instagram account.
"We are very good to Bast and his work, but.... sorry for the lawn", the caption reads.
The comments claim that because of the protective covering (special tile) the grass at the edge of the field was damaged.
The concert, scheduled for September 29, was never cancelled.
The football club "Rostov", as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
"I want to know the names of those players and representatives of Rostov who claim that my performance can cause damage, hinder the activities and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players", wrote Basta in response to criticism.
"Rostov-Arena" is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.
Five matches of the tournament were held there.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Wahtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now, many artists are talking about how they've managed to cope with cancer.
Unfortunately, the disease is not sparing anyone, and the stories of popular people about their victories over cancer give hope to many patients.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabize has admitted that he is alive only thanks to his wife.
He was diagnosed with a terrible condition years ago that sounded like a sentence.
"I felt like I was hit on the back of the head with a hammer.
I fell down.
I lost my bearings.
Put him in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
They started doing tests, it was bad, the artery's not leaking blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they had an emergency operation.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", - told Kikabiidze in the program "Once".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Back then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi residents even came to say goodbye to the idol on the doorstep of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow the actor to be buried alive, she believed that she could cope with the disease and for more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved husband.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a crisis, she was there like a rock", the actor admitted.
Arukte has managed to cope with his illness, and now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he denies rumors of his illness, of his untimely death, that appear on the Internet.
The creators of the site "Miratovets" have added Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Syjarto to the "Purification" section.
The reason was "attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the foreign Ministry of the neighboring country was accused of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participation in "organizing provocations aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens".
It should be noted that before Sijardo in the "Purification" was the governor of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Paul and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow patriarchs) Onufriy.
The reason was their opposition to the Ukrainian local church's acceptance of Tomos.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Transcarpathia, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities named the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On State Positions".
The real amount of the "golden parachute" of the temporary official released from office was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
This is the explanation given by the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, Agibalov's salary is 11 189 rubles.
Thus, the press service stressed, the amount of the one-time payment was 223 892 rubles after deduction of income tax, not 1 million rubles, which was written by the media.
The official has been receiving an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
He's been in the government for over nine years.
He is being granted this pension and a lump sum payment immediately after his dismissal, the regional government told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the payment of supplementary pension to Agibalov was suspended when he was appointed to the state service, and the size of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
Alexander Gusev, who won the election as acting governor of the region, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was dismissed from his post due to the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region ended.
On September 29, the Telegram channel "Nezygar" published documents that indicated that Agibalov, who had resigned as vice-governor, was paid a leave allowance of 23 salaries, and two days later he was again given the same position without the prefix "vrio".
State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the harm of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that teenagers are being provoked to masturbate by harmful information they find on the Internet.
The fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, a deputy of the Russian State Duma (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow speaks":
In general sex education, this should be done by explaining the harm, because there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it's that children are coming of age early enough, and then there are big scissors between their puberty and the opportunity to formally engage in intersex contact.
According to Onishchenko, the problem is being hampered by "hanzhi", the silencing of "sex age problems" and the lack of a culture of adequate child rearing.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are experiencing self-pity.
The MP believes that the lessons on the harm of onanism should be taught primarily in schools in "hyper-urbanised" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood, to put it mildly", the professor said.
Gennady Onichenko is an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a doctor of medical sciences, a professor.
Honored physician of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the All-Russian public organization "League of the health of the nation".

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is hitting another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
It seems that the German people are getting seriously tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policies, which have made the country a desirable destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious evidence of this is the latest polls, which show the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" becoming more popular, while the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the ADG broke another record, climbing to second place in the popularity rankings.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the vote, have managed to overtake the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one-percent gap can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is also worth noting that the ADG, which was created in 2013 by a small group of Eurosceptic economists, has managed to become a serious political force.
The overall lead is still held by the ruling bloc of the Christian Democratic Union/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points here - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who is leading the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, down 7 percent from last year.
We should add that the "greens" (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%) followed the Social Democrats.
The evolution of the Alternatives.
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's policy, but at first it focused on economic issues, including the euro and EU cooperation.
The group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of the EU's weak economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and a complete exit of the country from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the political platform of the ADG expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party, which took over the niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for its failed immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AdG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative for Germany won seats in the European Parliament.
A video has been published with a journalist calling Ukrainians "a nation of jerks"
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted in a live broadcast that he considers his compatriots "a nation of bolvans".
They trust the TV and don't read much.
As Drozov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught the culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood", the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdow's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the Independent State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee has begun to fight literature that has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning as many as 201 editions.

Canadians have created a car for the apocalypse - The Magazine Behind the Wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
The apocalypse armored car Roshel Senator APC
The apocalypse is not just a game, a movie, or a book that makes money.
Now, car companies are also taking on a new niche.
For example, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions has unveiled its Senator APC apocalypse armored vehicle.
In their spare time, the engineers of this company are building armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are not particularly comfortable but are safely accommodated in a welded armored capsule.
This bunker, which is not a design, because its level of armor corresponds to the standard B7, installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from shells and anti-personnel mines.
The armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
To prevent the passengers from being hurt by the blast wave from the shell that exploded next to the car, the car's cabin is equipped with special cushioning seats.
The capsule also has an autonomous ventilation and fire-fighting system.
For safe inspection, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a night vision camera system and a rooftop observation tower.
There's no weapons in the car.
Front of the Roshel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armored vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower turbo diesel engine with a displacement of 6.7 liters, all of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored vehicle via a 6-speed automatic gearbox.
There 's no chance of getting stuck at all with the Roshel Senator APC .
The Roshel Senator APC will be on display at the Washington DC Exposition in October.
The deadline of the universe is called
The universe is about 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the observable world, which is about 13.8 billion years.
The international team's research is available on arXiv.org and is being published in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports.
This is the conclusion that scientists have reached by observing some ten million galaxies with the help of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) telescope.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, scientists working within the framework of the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter) estimated the expansion rate of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
A press release from Subaru noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the European Planck space telescope's data recording clarified the limitations imposed on ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible demise of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new evidence that the observable world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Break.
Another attempt to unite pension referendum initiators failed
The opportunity to get the public 's opinion on pension reform is being postponed indefinitely
In Moscow, a meeting of the federal initiative group against raising the retirement age was held on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, which registered different formulations of issues (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of not increasing the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, at which the citizens of Russia receive the right to appoint an old-age pension?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally most capable.
The majority of the participants were supporters of the "Justice Russia" member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups joined them - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov told Vedomosti earlier that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their agreement to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her formulation was supported by 15 other subgroups), told "Vedomosti" that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who was a friend and who was an enemy".

That's why we made this decision", - quotes the club's press service.

Turbin's mistakes were like a horn of plenty.
Former All-Union category judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Locomotive" - "Ahmath" and explained the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you feel about Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the match between Lokomotiv and Ahmad?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness to referee matches of the Russian Premier League.
I'm surprised that in the fifth round match between Spartacus and Dynamo, neither Turbin nor the DSI leaders made any serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not delay to affect in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private misses of rude approaches were sipped like a horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder is knocked down with his hands in his penalty area by the defender of "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
Eight yards from the gate, but Turbin's not giving a penalty.
- How do you feel about the episode with Idov, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed like the ball was in his hand?
- I believe there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his own penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, and he can see the scene and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and the penalty was not awarded.
So the score was distorted, and the sporting justice was compromised.
It was the very occasion when the concept of judging had displaced and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin didn't dare to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight with Krychovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he demonstrated his applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Should we have shown the second mustard?
- Turbin's first yellow card was not quite right.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing, that some teams are penalised for such violations, as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the football player's words?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it to me.
So the referee doesn't give the second penalty in the opposite goal.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of the double standard is that the referee looks at who's playing.
Locomotive played on Saturday and Ahmat had a serious complaint about Turbine's work because the team was undermined.
Matt Damon played Judge Kavanaugh, the rapist, on SNL.
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of NBC's Saturday Night Live.
In a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh in a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee previously drew attention for his emotional and detailed narratives during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Kawano has repeatedly admitted to his love of beer, but has never been drunk to the point of amnesia.
In addition, in an attempt to clear himself of the rape charge, Kawano claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
Damon beat those moments, too.
I just did it, drinking a lot and not thinking about sex.
I was the proudest, most drunken virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows that", said Matt Damon's execution judge.
Previously, Kavanaugh was elected as the U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
Barbra Streisand has discovered some strange behaviors in her cloned dogs .
American singer Barbra Streisand has claimed that clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They're not alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but you can't clone a soul", the 76-year-old singer emphasized.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Cotton-de-Tuleur dog, Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health issues.
In July 2018, it was reported that the Miracle Milly, the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so tiny.
The US has considered sea blockade of Russia over oil and gas supplies
The US could launch a naval blockade of Russia to gain an edge in the global energy market.
The American authorities are so eager to succeed in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
The possibility of a naval blockade was mentioned by Ryan Zinke, the head of the US Department of the Interior.
Contrary to international practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including implementing policies in the area of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinka's statement was entirely within the competence of the department he heads, although it was not without political overtones.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. Navy, the U.S. has control of the sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinke suggested that the need may be related to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinké reminded that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activism in this region, Zinkke believes.
The minister made it clear that the United States still hopes to secure leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
Washington will have to squeeze Russia and Iran, and a sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on that path, Zinke believes.

The evacuation was through the Abu-ed-Duhur humanitarian corridor.
The center also reported on the tense situation in the de-escalation zone.

Supersonic passenger aircraft to go into series production in Russia
The serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the General Director of the Central Aerodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky, Kirill Sipalo.
According to him, the scientific center is working on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortia and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"We feel that it will take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, and another 10-15 years to get a serial machine that allows us to carry out transportation across the vastness of our homeland", added Sypalo.
He said that now Russian experts are facing the question of how to make the technology economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the aviation equipment developer of the PJSC "Tupolev" announced the completion of pre-project work on the supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to develop a speed of up to 1900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.

He said that on CNN.
He said he could only confirm the Washington Post columnist's claim that Putin's aggression against Ukraine resulted in the unification of Ukrainians.
"In 2013, 16% of Ukrainians supported the transatlantic integration of Ukraine, the accession to NATO.
Now it's over 54%.
Who did this?
I'm not going to lie.
In 2013, the EU membership of Ukraine was supported by 33% of Ukrainians.
It's 74 percent now.
Who did this?
Putin", said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire", the Ukrainian president stressed.
As FAKTY wrote, in late September 2018, President Petro Poroshenko was in the United States and participated in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.

The Formula One Grand Prix of Russia
There's a club I'm watching in Russia.
Former captain of Chelsea and England John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartacus" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm following.
I've been watching him quite recently and I was curious to see him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a lot of sympathy for Spartak and I want to apologize again for my decision", Terry said, according to Chelsea fans' website.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and "Spartack" located on the fifth row, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red-and-white team will play against Yenisei on October 7, and Valery Karpin's team will take Orenburg a day earlier.
The precious violin was sold to the pawnshop for nothing .
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan in Somerville, Massachusetts, the attendant offered only $50 for an apparently old and unprintable instrument.
But the seasoned store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought the advice of an expert.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Fernando Galliano and is valued at $250,000.
The violin strings alone are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had been recently stolen from a local resident, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It's not clear how the violin got to the man who sold it to the pawnshop, but he has no prior history of run-ins with the law.
The manager says that now all those who bring a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we will face an exciting match: "Spartacus" will host "Rostov" at its stadium in Tushyn under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as is known, not at all alien to the "people's team".
The clubs are now tied at 15 points, and they share 3rd and 4th place in the table, falling far behind the leaping Zenit and being one point behind Krasnodar, who tomorrow plays against Dynamo.
The red and white are in a tough spot: the club is once again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly invaded Rapido, and recently lost at home to Ahmadu.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartack" with a minimum score and not without difficulty defeated in the Cup "Black Sea", and it is still too early to say whether the most popular club of Russia has approached the exit from the crisis.
Rostov could not win three matches in a row, but the defeats are not known here already five matches.
Let's see if Carpin can extend his unbeaten streak with a game of his own.
The previous meeting of the Karpinsky "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
It starts at 7:00.
Aftermath of powerful tsunami shocks Indonesia

London is bursting with accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the Cold War, British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party congress in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, and the enemy is operating in gray areas with cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Russia would pay a heavy price if it did not comply with international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year of ex-G.R.U. Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for Britain, and his daughter Julia.
In the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, a referendum is held on joining the EU and NATO, subject to changing the country's name.
The referendum is meant to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the country's name, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a staunch supporter of renaming the republic into North Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring the preparations for the referendum and today's vote.
The head of the observation mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the observers' work was organized:
About 100 teams traveled across the country to monitor the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the preparation of minutes.
For a month, we had 10 teams working in the country, monitoring the preparation of the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the campaign finance law and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgari: "About 500 foreign observers are closely watching the vote.
The observation teams record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions to then present it in the final report".
The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and the Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was stated by professional synchronized translator Barbel Saxse on International Translator's Day, September 30.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan their events calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, "slow down and drive fast".
But I think it is not important for people to understand each other and for the work of the translator", the expert told RIA Novosti.
To understand that the two countries cannot do without each other, "it is enough to know the history", says the translator.
And in the future, Sachse noted, Germany has no sense in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny", she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to "build relations" with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, the project of the Nordstrom-2 gas pipeline, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the Baltic Sea, is especially important for Berlin's mania.

Comedy "Evening School" topped the US box office
The comedy "Evening School", which debuted in U.S. theaters last Friday, earned $28 million in its first weekend at the box office.
This result allowed the uncomplicated film starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to top the U.S. box office for September 28-30.
The film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million internationally, including $2 million from British audiences.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkably, quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer to the Western market - the cartoon "Smallfoot", the curious story of the acquaintance of a charming Yeti with a representative of the human race, in whose existence the main character never believed.
The project, directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig, grossed $23 million in its opening weekend, generally matching the expectations of experts who predicted the film would gross $20-25 million over the weekend.
As for the total collections of "Smallfoot", at the moment they are $38.6 million (although it debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the film's treasury by 3,6 million.
The three strongest this time was closed by the children's fairy tale "The Secret of the Clockhouse" by the master of horror, Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director knows how to make a quality film for an audience of 12+.
In its second week on the market, the John Bellers film adaptation of the book, starring the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett, earned $12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide box office to $53.8 million.
Despite dropping out of the top 3, Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick's "Simple Request" continues to surprise with a "+" sign: in 17 days in the American box office, Paul Figg's film, from which some unrealistic financial accomplishments were not expected from the word "all", has collected $43 million (including $6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has a total revenue of $62.9 million.
The latest entry in the top five this week was the horror film "The Curse of the Nun", which grossed $5.4 million in the reporting period.
Spin-off "The Spell" has grossed $330 million in 24 days in American theaters and has recently been the most successful film in the franchise, which also includes two parts of "The Spell" and two films about the creepy doll Annabel.
Just after Corinne Hardy's horror movie, another new genre came out last weekend, Hallfest, one of the top teen horror films of the year.
In its first weekend, the childhood of famed filmmaker (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked on a number of major horror projects, including "Happy Death Day", to which "Hellfest" is somewhat similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Considering the film's modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was "Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which doesn't seem to be thinking about dropping out of the top 10 of the American box office: the romantic comedy, which has been on the screens for seven weeks, is the sixth highest-grossing film of all time in the genre, with a score of 165.7 million.
That 's the amount the film has earned on the domestic market - 218.8 million .
As for the last three lucky winners in the top 10 in the US for September 28-30, they were Predator, White Guy Rick and... The Copper Mines, who earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million, respectively, last weekend.
We'll add that the coming weekend in the United States will be filled with the much-anticipated "Venom" with Tom Hardy, who - there's no doubt about it - will easily take the lead at the American box office in the first weekend of October.
Other premieres this week include the musical melodrama "A Star Is Born", winner of the Venice Film Festival by Bradley Cooper, and the crime drama "Your Hate".

"My colleague was talking about the Siberian fans, and I want to celebrate our fans", Belov's official website "Vityaz" quotes him as saying.

But I'm still gonna take the fall.
Because we must have missed something in the preparation.
Compared to the last game, it was a different team".
"This is ugly coitus".
The audience is outraged by Agustin's choice for the Voice show.
Viewers of the show "Golos 60+" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "depraved parenting and brazen manipulation".
When he first recognized his father, Nikolai Agutin, at the blind auditions, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But his son's feelings got the better of him, and he chose a relative to be on his team.
Many people thought it was a joke, but they forgave the coach for his lack of objectivity in the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers, absolutely unjustifiably.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agustin for such an injustice.
Yesterday, we viewers of the show were outraged by the grotesque and blatant dragging of our close relatives up the final stairs.
I even doubted that Agutin would have the strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end of the first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "smiled" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it by what the audience still wanted to see in his father's show.
But it turns out that's not the case, the audience wants an objective evaluation and to see the final with really talented performers, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I feel for the voice of Agutin, they were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how much he loved Dad, and today he had to show himself to be a professional".
"The competition has lost its meaning".
"Take two talented people out of the project and leave your dad who doesn't sing and whispers, how can you call a mentor after that?"
"Like how Dad sings, arrange a concert for him in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people come to that concert".
This is The Voice, not Cool Cousins.
"It was unprofessional of Agutin".
"Then I should offer my own show to my dad, not the one that Channel 1 is paying for".
"This was a real opportunity for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should be more understanding to me than any other contestant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a great voice and timbre get eliminated and Dad Agutin get to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces on stage and on screen for decades!
Because you can't get through witchcraft!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
There's a lot of gossip and gossip.
And the money for the family budget will be not too much!
The theater of the absurd continues!"
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" at the blind auditions came the son of Gradsky.
It never occurred to the meters to take their son on their own team.
More than that, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all right".
Agutin couldn't act like a professional.

Russia to start fines for violations in share construction
From tomorrow, Russia will start to fine for violations in the field of share construction, the channel "Russia 24" reports.
Companies and officials are threatened with penalties if they do not submit the data on the building to the Unified Housing Information System in time.

In central Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 in Ivan Kudry Street, the capital's law enforcement officials said.

The head of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about the possible program of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community is now developing such areas.
"There is no consensus yet", the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space radiation sources", Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organic matter on Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help us figure out how life came to be on planets.
Earlier, the head of the corporation "Roscosmos" said that in an optimistic version, the Russian Federation can make a manned flight to the Moon by 2030.
An offended customer dumped a trash can at 7-Eleven .
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, is said to have had a grudge against the manager of the 7-Eleven chain of 24-hour stores, who fired him in May for inappropriate behavior.
And decided to take revenge on his enemy in a new way.
At 2:30 a.m., he went into the store and threw the contents of his basket on the floor and on some of the merchandise on the shelves.
The trash was found to contain feces and urine Simms had borrowed from a nearby mobile bio-toilet.
The police arrived at the scene and arrested the "avenger".
He was put in jail and released pending trial on $300 bail.
He was charged with trespassing and criminal trespassing, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
While Simms' crime may seem more ridiculous than serious, the verdict may be harsh enough, as he has repeatedly broken the law before: large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving, and animal cruelty.

This is what Deutsche Welle is saying.
The event was attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Laschet met Erdogan at the airport in Cologne, but refused to go to the mosque, saying the event could turn into a "highly politicized event".
Reker said she received an unofficial invitation on the eve of the opening, Friday, September 28.
According to her spokesman, such a proposal should be considered late and not serious.

I think we'll get him into the games later.

The SBU identified and detained the owner of a Peugeot-301 car, which was driving around the capital with the number plates of the so-called "DNR".
He was a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who is currently working as an agent of one of the insurance companies of Ukraine.
According to the SBU press center, the detainee explained that the car had been in the Interpol line since 2014, and was detained in Russia and handed over to him as a representative of the insurance company.
When crossing the Ukrainian-Russian border, he took off the fake number plates, but when entering Kiev he reinstalled them.
According to him, he did this "to ensure the correspondence of the registration number of the package of documents for the mentioned car, issued by Russian representatives of Interpol, in case of the vehicle being stopped for inspection by the police of Ukraine".
"Currently, a set of measures are being taken to verify the explanations provided, as well as to establish his possible involvement in terrorist activities", the SBU said.
It should be noted that in Ukraine, the use of numbers issued by terrorists in the territories of Donbass occupied by them is prohibited.
By the way, a State Border Guard officer was seen in a car with similar numbers in Mariupol.

The United States could blockade Russia at sea if necessary to prevent its energy supplies to the Middle East.
This was announced by the US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that the only source of income for the Russian economy is the sale of energy and Moscow is pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe, writes the Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation is similar with Iran.
There are two options for its solution, according to the minister: military and economic.
The first is that he would prefer not to use it, so it's necessary to put pressure on and push Iran's energy resources out.

Russian Williams driver Sergei Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Russian Grand Prix.
"I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I was caught between two cars that immediately stopped me.
I lost all the positions I had at the start, in a moment, instantly.
I was in a very bad position.
I got stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the others hit the pit stop, we'd get some fresh air and get the pace back, but the rubber was gone.
Plus he was fighting with a partner, and he was in contact with him.
I understand he made a mistake.
We were in this situation on the most uncomfortable track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore", - quotes the words of Sirotikin RIA "News".
Sirotkin finished 18th in the race at the Russian Grand Prix, and Lewis Hamilton, a British Mercedes driver, won the race.
Tarpishev called it absurd to remove Glushakov and Yeschenko from the foundation of "Spartacus"
Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) President Shamil Tarpichev commented on the suspension of players of Moscow's "Spartack" Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yeschenko from training with the main squad after a criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It's a complete foolishness to pay attention to such things.
I don't agree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the team's discord.
First, it's poetry, you can read it and you can understand it.
I wouldn't react to that if I were Carrera.
Everybody has their own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to get laid.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko are liking it, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal team atmosphere.
Spartacus doesn't have a game tonight, so there was no need to inflate the situation.
Maybe we should have laughed at this together.
Spartak have a lot of things wrong with their lineup, they've been in a lot of trouble since they joined the youth team.
The relationship within the team, apparently, does not add optimism before this match", - says Tarpichev.
The two teams will play on September 30 and start at 19:00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously turned down Spartak, has taken charge of Chelsea's youth team.
Sirius students discussed nature-like technology with scientists
The students of the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobotany and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The researchers' presentation was held within the framework of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on the instructions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the website of the educational center reported on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov's Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force of civilization development.
The scientist's lecture is published on the website of "Sirius".
The students learned that modern technology requires a tremendous amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing this much.
The forum organizers say that the technology that young scientists are working on today will help solve this problem.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, as well as told about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of this technology is a unique thing, a tremendous blessing.
It's the explosive growth of medical technology, it's the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually the technological reproduction of living systems.
There is the flip side, which is the deliberate interference with human life.
There's always a risk.
The car came along, people started dying under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am developing new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction", REN TV quotes the scientist.
After watching the film and discussing the latest scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants.
Speakers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov complex of natural-like technologies of the NBICS "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-technologies, Вячеслав Демин.
The Sirius Education Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further support gifted children at an early age.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on information security "Cybercall" will be sent to study at "Sirius".
An air traffic controller sacrifices his life to save a plane during an earthquake in Indonesia

The 21-year-old dispatcher had to jump from four stories.
He suffered severe injuries to his internal organs in the fall, and doctors were unable to save him.

This was stated by American rear admiral Dave Johnson, reports "Rosbalt" with reference to The National Interest.
"We are facing a formidable potential adversary.

Macedonia: referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was called to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje on renaming the Balkan country into "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians using the name of their historic province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic a pathway into NATO and later into the EU.
But, according to EFE, only 34% of the voters in Sunday's plebiscite "did not reach the constitutional threshold of 50%".
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if more "yes" votes were cast, Macedonia would change its name, despite the lack of a quorum.

Kemerovans have upset a flock of sheep at the cemetery
On September 30, a witness posted on the Kemerovska social networking page that horned animals were freely roaming one of the local cemeteries.
The animals walked in large herds between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators were divided: one local resident said that there is no harm in having small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help clear the area of weeds and grass, but some of the city's residents were not happy with the behavior of the animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the sheep to do.
Of course, you can't say that the sheep are blasphemous, but that's not the point". (style preserved) - the indignant Kemerov girl noted in her message.
Anyway, one of the witnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
What's the right way to do it?
There are no words to make it so.
Right, finish.
The word "press" in the sense of "pull, influence, affect" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "press".
We use this word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "do" are not only etymologically unrelated, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
To bring (church-book, outdated) means "to be enough, full, sufficient, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Pleasure is a relative word.
It used to mean "not dependent on anything, having a self-satisfying meaning" - "to satisfy oneself".
Old Slavic "dwllti" is related to the words "to command" and "will".
Hit and suppress are two different things.
These words have truly terrifying "relatives": daos, "wolf" (sheep-crushing), deyja, "to die", and dvaidī, "to crush".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "to finish", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]vele" that is used in writing through "a", which is, well, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
All right, you're right.
But it's an obsolete word, in its proper sense no longer used.
If you want to point out that circumstances/people are having a negative impact on you from above, use the word "pressure".
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember, this is a clerk's office.

"Kimmy, did you get a chance to fight for the pole today?

But I don't think it really affected the outcome".
"Sochi is very difficult to overtake, the start of the race will be the key moment?"
"Maybe, but you never know.
It's going to be difficult anyway, because our car is noticeably slower than the Mercedes".

Russia has protected itself from terrorists with the help of the operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was said in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the VKS, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-to-air weapons: the air-to-space forces have been and continue to be striking the targets of terrorists.
Bondarev said that in three years, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria, including munitions depots, fortifications and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes broke through the jihadist defense, a crucial contribution to the advance of Syrian government forces, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed us to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIL, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand fighters from the ranks of Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of ISIS, reports TASS.
And it's only about the registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, Russia is fighting international terrorism in Syria at distant frontiers - otherwise this evil would "slip to us".

Syria accuses the US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed the infrastructure and public services in the areas against which it was directed, it has committed mass killings of the civilian population, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law", he said.
Muallem said the US and its partners had been providing "direct support to terrorists" because the militants' and the Western coalition's goals in Syria were the same and meant "sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path".
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost over, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to cleanse Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of the Opposing Parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The United States has denied all charges.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of passports by Hungary in Transcarpathia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I am protecting the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine", Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are - in the east or the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which intends to expel the consul of this country from the coast.
"I completely agree with every letter that the Foreign Ministry has said", the President noted.
As FAKTY reported, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuing Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian consulate in Berevovo.
They also voiced their loyalty to Hungary.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consul, who appears in the video of Ukrainians being issued Hungarian passports, must leave Ukraine either by Budapest's decision or be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Transcarpathian region has opened a criminal case on the fact of issuing passports to Hungary.
The incident is classified as treason.
Putin has secretly arrived in Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the CIS Council of States, as well as held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Flight data on the Flightradar website shows that the Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport at around 6 pm Tajikistan time on September 28 and took off to the northeast.
The aircraft's transponder was turned off near Lake Balkhash.
The flight path indicates the plane was heading for Khakassia.
According to the Baikal24 news agency, the president met the head of the region Viktor Zimin in Abakan on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the site's sources believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round".
Next Sunday, the second round of the regional elections is scheduled to take place in Khakassia.
It was attended by Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the republic Victor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour, along with Konovalov, Andrey Filiagin ("Justice Russia") is expected to take part.
The Khakassia media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as make a decision regarding the fate of Zimin.
Putin already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favorite vacation spots.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the seven-year-old armed conflict in Syria.
Some five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan.
Damascus now believes that the fighting is coming to an end and that the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allem said in a UN speech: "The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing reconstruction work in the areas devastated by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions are in place for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to help the return of refugees and allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide aid to Syria, saying a political solution to the conflict must be found first.

Metropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev 's decision to rename the UOC to the actions of the fascists
The head of the synodal Department of external church relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Ilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
"It's like in fascist Germany, to put a yellow star on a Jew is to label the Church as an enemy organization, and this is exactly the purpose of this bill", the metropolitan said in the broadcast of the TV channel "Russia-24" (quoted by "Interfax").
He believes that this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "put it out of the law", the cleric believes.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country", he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of the law projects No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Deputy Pochaevsky Lavra called for protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian sanctuaries
The deputy of the Holy-Uspensky Pochaevsky Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian sanctuaries.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in history, our ancestors and their relatives in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has developed, and the information we have, and the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something", the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The deputy also stressed that he probably "would need your physical presence".
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in spirit, threatening to be massacred, so we will protect our sanctuary".
Those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - an Orthodox Ukrainian and world sanctuary, should be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to listen to those who mislead the faithful.
The UOC has a canonical status, as determined by the Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make you dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Roman Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style and its consequences are unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status of our church", the deputy of the laurel noted.
He recalled that the UOC has been canonically independent and fully independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos is already in our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" - noted Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other denominations have Tomos, whether they are independent of the Vatican.
The believers sort of figured out which temple to go to.
Yet, some want to sow discord and strife again.
Some people are jealous of the glittering domes of the temples they want to destroy", the priest said.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on the top of the Pochaevskaya mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical records of it date back to the beginning of the XIII century.

You cling to every word, live in a normal, normal family", wrote @nataliamama37.
Some advised Buzova to consult a psychologist or at least read books on the subject.
"Why don't we read the psychology literature?
What do you do to avoid being a victim?" @liashukgalina wrote.
However, there were those who supported the singer.

Keep your nose up and keep going", @kreszentia_f wrote.

"The game was good, interesting, although it went to the goal" - quotes the words of Vorobiev official website "Automobile".
"Trying to play it really simple.
I really liked the first period.
Missed a few good moments.
In the second period, the opponent pushed us a little, we held on.
But the removal has fed us a little.
The guys were playing great, doing the coaching setup.
I think if we keep playing as well as we've been playing, the wins will come.
No goals scored, no goals won, but the content of the game was correct.
Luck will come if we keep playing in that direction".
"Do you think the "Automobile" is more than the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"There was no foreign band playing.
In the preseason, the teams were doing other things, and there were a lot of young guys.
I think it was a different game, a different hockey.
The Motorcyclist is a good team.
The tournament table shows the team is playing right.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
All we can do is wish them luck.
The team's moving in the right direction.
There's a lot of good players, there's leaders.
Good defense, good goal.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew the team was going to be unbeaten, we wanted to break it, but we couldn't".

Macedonian opposition leader refuses to vote in referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is held on the issue of the intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-DPMNE) Christiane Mitzkowski has stated that he will not vote in the referendum.
Party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky explained that Mitskowski decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the agreement, which he considers "pernicious".
According to the press secretary, the current referendum is about changing the name of the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, the president of Macedonia, Georgi Ivanov, refused to participate in the September 30 referendum.

The U.S. is helping Afghanistan grow its opiate production
The dramatic escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much talked about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghanistan, the militants have launched a real terrorist war against the government and the civilian population.
This year has been a record year for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans", Patrushev noted.
The troubles in Afghanistan didn't start yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the main enemy of the United States was the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in Russia), which had settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and its NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
There are thousands of American troops on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are being forced behind the walls of dozens of their bases.
How can they, they buy money from the militants, as long as they don't get hurt.
The Afghan government controls a smaller portion of the country's territory - 40 percent, Patrushev said.
50% - the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% are ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they're growing fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia, the same thing they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with it.
It is also interesting that in the 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The enormous growth of opium poppy plantations and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO on the condition of changing the country's name.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor's right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social changes.
And Greece will claim its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy".
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are pushing for the country's renaming.
Opposed by the conservative opposition and the country's president, Georgi Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimaanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Faye Dolgari, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice made by the Macedonian people will determine the future not only of the Balkans but of Europe as a whole".
