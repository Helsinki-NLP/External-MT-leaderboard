First, iron these shirts.
I can run faster than you.
I run five miles a day.
I'm going to run.

I sat and stared.
I sat down next to him.

I sold it this afternoon.

Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.

I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to enjoy myself.
There's one or two things left to put in the suitcase.

I suggest you talk to Tom.
I assume you're packed and ready to go.
I've heard that sound somewhere before.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half miles a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Do you do dangerous work?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no room for doubt.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're through with it.
I'll take his place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
He came out of nowhere.
You'd be better off with your sister.
It goes hand in hand with the love I have for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
This is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It must be expensive.
It'd be a shame to see all that work go to waste.
He's clearly freaked out.
It's not broken.
I was fine.
That didn't help much.
It was snowing.
It hasn't stopped snowing.
I don't care if you come or not.
He's not doing anything!
It doesn't matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they poured it on me.
I slowly realized that I had misunderstood him.
It snowed the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
It happened early last week.
It was on our wedding day, honey.
There had to be a reason for that.
It was sudden.
It happened while he was out.
It's happened to me a few times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should diet.
I think everyone is hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think he'll be fine with his neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think I lost some film.
I think I can do that.
I don't think I could kill.
I don't think I could kill.
I don't think I understood you.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying here.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I thought I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think that's fair.
There's very little chance, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do that yourself.
I think he's going to leave.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time for a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think it is.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mary.
I think you'd better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll do well with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I think spiders are cute.
I think he's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about it.
I think that explains everything.
I think, therefore I drink.
I think, therefore I am.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think you did a great job.
I think that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's going to be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I suppose time will solve this problem.
I think Tom was already there.
I think Tom is exciting.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tom wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tom is winning.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we took a wrong turn somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all in a rut now.
I think you dialed the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tom's girlfriend's name is.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I think you'd like that.
I think you've got it all wrong.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you do a really good job.
I think you smell good.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I thought about Tom.
I thought maybe if we went out to eat, it would cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've thought about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't work out that way.
I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still at home.
I thought it was you or him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
It hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under the influence.
It was a big influence on me.
This is dangerous!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we've been talking about.
It's hard to please everybody.
It's hard to please everybody.
I have doubts about whether it will work.
It's getting late.
He left.
It's half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's time for you to start a new venture.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's the middle of the day.
This is my bedroom.
We must prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
It's not the best solution.
This is not the right solution.
It's not an exaggeration to say that he is a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not working.
He could be lying.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Whoa, it's really bad today!
That's expensive.
It's 100 feet long.
It's time for bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
That's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important to wash your hands thoroughly after you've changed the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's going to be dangerous.
It'll be dark by the time we get home.
It'll be ready when it's needed.
It'll be ready when we need it.
It's gonna take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
It's about to wear off.
It'll work if I can change the polarities.
So it looks bigger than it is.
It looks good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
I could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
It seems like you've thought of everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what counts.
That could be a long time.
It could be a trap.
This could save your life.
We might enjoy trying it.
I might be late.
You have to wash it.
It's got to mean something.
It must have been love.
It was definitely stolen.
It needs to be fixed.
It never existed.
It was never supposed to happen.
I lied to him even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do my best.
Tell him I said to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen.
I told you I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like it, Tom.
I have a question, too.
I took a long bath.
I was in the bath for a long time.
I've got it all worked out.
I took the 58th.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It's probably cheaper somewhere else.
It stopped raining yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I work out two hours a day.
I've been all over Russia.
I've been traveling the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I was trying to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'll keep trying to keep up with the news.
I'm trying to get my head together.
That's a good flag.
He's a big-bellied cat. He was a big-bellied cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
This is a dictionary.
It's a good plan, on paper.
A gray stone building.
This is a guard dog.
It's half an hour before lunch.
It's a hot day.
This is a kitchen knife.
It's dark outside.
This is all mine.
It's all right now.
That's all well and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's already 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same note.
It's an environmental disaster.
It is a nasty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see of it, the less I like it.
What a pity.
I'm sorry I was late.
It's a pity that Tom is leaving.
That's a pretty big piece of wood.
That's a terrible news.
It's freezing.
It's as much an art as it is a science.
That's in the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where even a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
Waste of money.
That's a funny question.
This is terrible.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing journey.
It's been a long day.
It's a tough day.
It's happened before.
It's been a hell of a week.
It's been two years since he left.
That's better
It's better to water the garden at night.
It's hot.
Oh, my God.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, and I'm lichen.
It's cold outside.
It's cold. Why don't you put on a sweater?
It is well known that the bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
It's all right now.
It's dangerous out here.
It's deep in here.
This is delicious.
It's ready!
It's easier to start than it is to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mary.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
It seemed like the bus was late.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
It seems like only yesterday we went to school together.
It seems nothing has changed.
It looks really weird.
It seems so.
It seems he's lying.
Tom doesn't seem to be in a hurry.
Like you don't want me to get it.
You seem to me to be honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're gonna have a special guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
It's expensive.
It's only fair that they get equal pay for equal work.
It's not even close to perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is yours.
You know, it's funny.
It's starting to get a little rough.
It's getting greasy.
We're going to have a rough winter.
It's not gonna be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for studying.
It's great you could make it.
That's so cool, I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to conclude that.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to sleep on.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
She's a ghostly beauty.
His head is way too big.
It's high.
The kids should be in bed.
Stop with the money-laundering!
Tonight is hotter than usual.
It's against the law.
This is important.
It's important for parents to be on the same page when it comes to raising children.
It's important that we help those who are in trouble.
It's not possible for me.
You're gonna have to choke in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to live up to your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
You never know what tomorrow will bring.
It's unbelievable, you know?
It's not inevitable.
This is inspiring.
It was just a feeling.
Just move it.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's really hard.
That's pretty important to me.
It's really nice of you to drive me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
There's a wash today.
It's like an undersea field, and the turtles and the shrimp and the sharks above it are like flying creatures.
This one's locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
This is me.
It's pathetic the way he lives.
It's too cold for swimming.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
It's my turn now.
It's never too late to be what you might have been.
It's none of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
This isn't a bank.
He's not as domineering as he sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This is not going to happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth crying about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't say that to you.
There's no point in confessing to a priest if you're not going to repent.
There's no point in dwelling on the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's clearly not possible.
Obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay to be considered a peasant by some.
It's okay to be gay.
 Three months later, Tom says he's fluent in French.  Well, he's at the top of the stupid gene.  What top?  The Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, right?
It's over now.
This is personal.
It's like a bowl of soup.
He's spread his wings.
It's really amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is to belittle the working class, to absolve imperialism of the responsibility for the bloody wars it has instigated, and to destroy the very idea that the causes of endless wars are man's innate aggressive tendencies.
It's really urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, right?
That's a really big number.
He's right over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are pretty.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
- What?
It's disgusting, you know?
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston right now.
It's so good to be home.
It's still moving.
This is suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem, you know?
That's still to be answered.
It's time to get our tent.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
It's time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's high time we did something about it.
Tom has a birthday today.
It's Tom's decision to make.
Tom's word counts against Mary's.
It's too dark to play football.
It's very dear to me.
It's too hot for this.
It's too late for grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn weather.
It's a shit thing to get a cold.
It's ugly, it's scratchy yellow, and it doesn't match anything, but at least they don't trip in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It's not likely anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go or not.
Very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's very entertaining.
It's expensive to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That was the deal.
It's your only chance.
To master a language, you need to study for about 10,000 hours.
You have to be bold to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It caught everyone by surprise.
It took exactly one hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me more than a month to recover from my cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but I finally found it.
I turned into a little alley.
I was.
I'm turning to the left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was a really good meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was freaking weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was definitely a lot of fun.
We had a good time last night.
It was hard at first.
He was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was humid.
It was just a field trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
I wanted this.
It was almost pitch black.
This was not long before John had a fit. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
