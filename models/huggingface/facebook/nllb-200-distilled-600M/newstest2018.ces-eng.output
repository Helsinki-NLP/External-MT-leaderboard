The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri based on state discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to exercise increased caution when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state, states the association's statement.
The NAACP stated that it acted on the basis of current Missouri state laws, which make it difficult to defend racist motivated acts in court, as well as the actions of criminal prosecutors that disproportionately target minorities.
There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police officers just because of their skin color, they are assaulted or killed, said Kansas City Star NAACP President Rod Chapel of Missouri.
"We have the largest number of complaints so far.
This is the first warning of its kind that the organization has issued to the U.S. government.
Incidents cited by the organization included racially motivated insults directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under controversial circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The travel guidelines also point to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's Office that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of travel advice is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
People must be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay any bail or alert their relatives that they are planning to travel by state.
According to the current FBI hate reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, ranking the state 16th among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it easier for a company to sue for discrimination in housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating that law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel advice is usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently, advocacy groups have resorted to such measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is still not calm after 12 years!
Model Sally Anne Bowman has been murdered.
A Croydon girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in the restaurant she worked at, stabbing her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
The killer was sitting in a nearby cafe watching the criminal investigation.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
The man only admitted to the juvenile assault in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had an argument the night before.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack, the girl started screaming".
"It even attracted the attention of taxi drivers", he falsely claimed.
The girl was supposed to defend herself, he said, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and she blamed him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his temper and his taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt content and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at her ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth", added the Mirror Linda.
And 12 years later, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so many cruel people in the wilderness who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there", the Mirror's mother of the deceased girl Linda revealed information about the disappearance of the ashes urn.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"Czechos are neither prudent nor conservative", says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
It's a place where you can find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Mareš.
It started off stealthily, about 12 years ago.
Martin Rage and his friends went on a cycling trip through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but a box full of vibrators with a strange look.
"Different snails and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different", he tells me about lunch.
His friend and another associate decided to work with the German designer of erotic aids Fun Factory, which fascinated Martin, and he offered to help with marketing.
When his companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, she runs a boutique called Intimity in Prague's Benedictine Street, where she sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't he?
It's also design subjects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, right?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin-based Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as the inspiration for Intimity.
It opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trading than everyone here is used to.
No hidden exposures, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed more like a perfume.
Martin and his business partner, Zdenek Šebelko, began to consider how to understand the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
They both liked the name Intimity.
"It's about intimacy, by the way, and it's kind of tender", he says.
It followed the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space that went along with various interior visualisations.
In the end, the variant won, which split the store into a pleasure garden and a bedroom run by the duke's bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Stepan of FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfect because he's not on Main Street, but then he's sitting next to Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one is checking on customers", Martin Rage praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that was different, with branded good goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered such a business at all.
When I walked into Intima's store half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going into an erotic aid shop.
I was surprised at the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from the fashion boutiques.
Just because the store is a female-only service, just because women don't hesitate to ask for help doesn't mean a man's foot wouldn't welcome them here.
Mostly gentlemen come here to buy presents for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know the right size and prefer larger ones", Martin smiles at the common mistake.
It's just this kind of bias, this cliché that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man of good faith would choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer mostly black clothes, whereas women tend to prefer pink.
The absolute bestseller today is a product aptly called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don't know which one is beating because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's a kind of touchless clitoral stimulator.
I feel a teenage need to run around admiring the serious tone of the interpretation.
It's like he's not crazy.
And it doesn't really come together.
It's a good price and it has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's some sort of revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in designing such products.
The other was a We-Vibe couple vibrator.
He has completely overturned the taboo that some men may have, that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Variants are being made", he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's the favorite category.
When a woman is in a love relationship, she can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, the category of attachment vibrators is a certain drawback.
At least here.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use them externally.
In Western Europe, however, it is very popular, especially among younger customers.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a concept like this would work exclusively for men.
I guess it's got to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men", reflects Martin.
"We have aids for them too, but to a limited extent". The biggest seller is a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn't look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It's very focused on functionality and user experience.
In Japan, it's a whole different story.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were very tolerant of erotic aids, I guess.
"This is the reality of the Internet", I'm told.
The ordinary one is a whole different story.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and they are taboo for women". Just to be interesting, what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented by Intimacy, sells worldwide still accounts for about half of what is sold in Japan alone.
In our waters
The Czechs and Czechs are not very prudent.
On the contrary, we are a very friendly nation.
Definitely different from countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business woman is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has some experience with sex life and some help.
She will come up with something nice, better, to complement her life as a partner or for herself". To get her back, Martin Ráž and his business partner, Zdenek Šebelka, take care of her by making sure that each product works perfectly.
We also don't want to go into bonding and latex specialties because we don't have room for them, and they don't fit in here.
These things could be reflective of the ones we're trying to target.
Which is people who always had to go to a sex shop because they were afraid they'd get something like that.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really nice.
It is also given by the selection of reputable brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever award was given to a seahorse, "and this has sparked a change in the industry.
They started to move away from cheap materials and instead to work with healthy ones, they started to produce different designs, different colors...
It's nice that some of them were designed by the Czech Republic, and it's a popular designer, Anna Mareš.
I have to say, I was quite pleasantly surprised how many people buy these Whoop.de.doo designer things from Anna Marsh, even though they're relatively expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus balls from Anna Marsh.
She's done a really big job of representing, both in the Czech Republic and abroad, exactly what we're trying to present -- that erotic aids can be done differently, beautifully, with a story.
Anna's story started as a school assignment.
Now it's a finished product, which is also made in our own country.
I wanted to control the manufacturing process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it's not a large production, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a large series.
I may be a little out of line, but I think it's important to keep up with the progress in the Czech Republic.
It could be that in a few years we will be unable to produce anything", Anna later tells me.
He doesn't have a negative or negative attitude.
They say people are upset at the most.
"But then you'll start smiling too". Anna Mares has a vibrator on offer for you to get a personal message on, and this year she's planning her own lubricant gel.
Next year, we should add vibration eggs and more news.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Rage wouldn't sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we're more defined by a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request they ever received?
Just this week, an email came in asking for a masturbation assist for her friend with a 6-foot-tall body.
So we had to write to her, saying we don't have any.
The question is, did anyone make fun of us?" Martin looks at me with a suspicious look.
It happens every now and then.
A blow to Karl Gotta.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karl Christmas is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gotta's best friend is battling a disease that will steal people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true", confirmed the sad information of the Lightning himself the singer.
I know about my illness, and I'm quite able to handle it, given the circumstances.
"I take medicines that slow down the disease", he added, thanking his family for their support.
The whole family has come together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife tries to be home as much as possible, and her daughter from her first marriage, Susan and Teresa, is driving home to her father's White Mountain home.
The father-in-law had twice battled cancer and was sharing his experience with Slavic to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's got 60 chemotherapies to go.
He was able to return to work and to the tennis court and ski slopes.
"The astrologer predicted that I would be here by 90", said Charles Lightning.
He's a warrior.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song so that I don't forget them", admitted Karel.
Actress Kveta Fial is now in the same institution.
Do you have a family member with Alzheimer's?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be reviewed by the U.S.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial termination of pregnancy, so it cannot be carried out for health reasons.
"I'm sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years", complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court of Chile has 10 members and should have a new president by the end of August, who is close to the opposition, AFP said.
The bill to repeal the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it violated the right to life of the unborn child.
Members of Parliament postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analyzed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the House passed the bill and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, artificial termination of pregnancy should be stopped as a crime in three cases: if a woman's life is threatened, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape.
Similar exceptions existed in Chile as early as 1931, before women were granted the right to vote there in 1949, according to Spanish newspaper El País.
The absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where abortion is absolutely prohibited.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, about 20 women are now in prison, serving up to 30 years in prison for terminating a pregnancy.
In many cases, human rights defenders claimed that the abortion was spontaneous, and the court ruled that it was murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of the Trump White House is now the Statue of Liberty.
The unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of the sculpture.
Americans could tell it as well as anyone else - see the carefully staged toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key Trump administration supporters, certainly knew what he was aiming for when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set off with a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty.
It's fitting to add that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
For this, he would be chained by a crowd of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty imitators.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903, a plaque with the famous poem of Emmy Lazarus was placed on the base, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, "I don't want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the substrate, which you are referring to, is not part of it.
Miller is indeed right, but as he himself has said, this is not history.
These are, above all, the shocking words of Emmy Lazarus, which resonate today - calling not only immigrants but the poorest of the poor: 'Come to me, the downtrodden, the poor, the free to breathe, the poor worm in the midst of cities.'
And it's in modern times that we can better than ever watch these worms live on our screens.
Miller was not trying to criticize poetry - he was trying to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the significance of the statue is part of a vast political and cultural war: it's essentially a conflict over the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, tried to put a plaque with poems on the base of the statue, knew she was about to enter a high-level political game.
The statue was to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: the Exile Mother.
Combining poetry with the image of women is a brilliant feminist gesture and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long tried to reverse that meaning.
A well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on the Trump administration - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty actually does not bring anyone into the country, but represents early neoconservatism, bringing American flame to the backward world: The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He's taking the freedom march out of the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The ship is not to light the way to the United States.
Limbaugh is surprisingly pointing to something important.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned traveler who often arrives in a new land with hope in his heart after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It's literally a worldview through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that's a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly don't recognize.
Their march is not to light the way, but to stir up hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the UK Athletics Federation, Neil Black, said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a huge asset to the team.
For the 2017 London Olympics, which starts on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes were selected.
Black believes something strange is happening in Scotland and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're working on it", Black said.
I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish Athletics representatives think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think the same thing.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing.
Several Scottish athletes will be striving for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as team captain.
Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, Black said.
A number of athletes, whether Scottish or other nationalities, left the room with a sense of enormous pride and motivation.
The passion and unabashed feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
In the past year alone, middle-distance runner Muir has set five British and two European records.
She will be competing in the 1500m and 5000m.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1500m track and won the British team event and the Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team said she was very proud that not only did a large number of her teammates join the team, but in many cases they would also attack the final and the medal.
"What's unusual about being a team captain is that I was chosen by the other team members, and it was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team members is a great pleasure", she added.
I'm obviously very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've gone.
They're athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
What about my opening remarks?
Yeah, I think she did.
I was just pointing out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on home soil.
It's important to use the support of the home fans and to rejoice in the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.
Blocking Facebook critics: Don't worry about public office unless you can handle voter criticism
Our father knew his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to criticize him for anything from domestic politics to his political views.
Yeah, that criticism didn't keep him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and we'll be led like sheep to slaughter by fools and dumb".
That brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on getting him to behave like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was indicted by the American Civil Liberties Union for these crimes.
The governor's staff rejected the lawsuit as unfounded, and comments on the Internet have revealed many "who's who" of opinions.
"It's just Facebook", many users said.
It still matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he's an extremely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second-highest ranking of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not a pushover.
As you can see, he runs his country with confidence and strict principles.
He also proved to be adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents - except for publishing the first photo of his head naked after chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his taxpayer-paid staff - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by saying that the comment block was from the position of moderating posts.
But using images of internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post has reported several real people whose contributions have been deleted.
And that's exactly what they are -- real people talking to their elected leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs, pastors, no trolls.
As they all stated, their comments were polite and considerate, not slanderous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi's lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md., has been questioning hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I have been very kindly told that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other news", she wrote in the Washington Post comment section.
I dislike the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people label them as promoting so-called collective efforts, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.
What the governor's staff called "focused spam interest" others would probably call "protection jobs".
The modern age of Facebook allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would have required sending workers to the streets to collect and burn all critical printings or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chairwoman said District Judge James C. Cacherise violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, where she barred one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's day, low postal prices had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the daily newspaper quadrupled and its leadership was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even back in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people within the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have been gathered in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation are at the very foundations of our nation.
And a real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs have quickly taken advantage of free roaming, and abroad they use more data than at home.
Overseas Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
They move most often in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holidays, they spend more time browsing the Internet, and they often don't have access to Wi-Fi in the sun.
The beach, the bathroom, and the smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
That's according to the latest statistics from O2.
The new roaming rules have made it possible for most Czech travellers abroad to have more data available within the framework of the fee than at home.
It is no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum number of people travels during the winter, data consumption has increased even 50 times this summer.
Italy came in second in the consumption data.
Most Czech people spend their time in Germany, where many work during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs a year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
But people here traded for a book for sharing experiences on a mobile phone.
The record was July 7th this year.
"The data transferred would contain tens of millions of photos", said Silvia Cieslar, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia leads in data, the highest number of Czech users are in neighbouring countries.
First place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We're going to Austria for a tourist trip and an active vacation where we don't have much time to browse the Internet.
"In addition, the Czech Republic is heading directly to the Adriatic", Cieslar explained.
While the data operator recorded a high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, the growth for telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes spent roaming has doubled from last year.
With a huge lead over the rest of the world, Germany dominates here.
'Roaming calls are more used by business customers on their journeys,' Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golf player Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for the next three days in a cool atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the East Lothian area of Scotland, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Northern Irish Ronan Rafferty, who last year played at nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the final, will be serving as the tournament ambassador this year on behalf of founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly before my eyes and this year's tournament show the world its beauty", said Rafferty.
Players will be able to love the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a passionate advocate of the game and proud of his accomplishments.
This year's tournament is in the right hands.
Englishman Eales will defend his first title, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it", said the Southport golfer.
I didn't have the chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was canceled.
It's magical to be back in this part of the country.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when winning meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
Those were wonderful times I will never forget.
Homecoming Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 later this year.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I've always loved playing on the home ground", Orr said of Helensburg.
You want to succeed and you feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really happy to be playing again, and I think I'm doing great.
I'm happy with the result so far.
The three players will be joined on the court by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In fact, he seldom uses a pan.
In her wooden hut in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali, in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually throws a sweet potato - in the local language nota - right into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes out the potatoes and tastes them with his hands unwashed.
Bardina sits on a muddy ground - the house is not furnished - where she does her daily work, such as washing laundry in the frozen water of a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof is flooding the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night is a danger: most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"After five o'clock in the afternoon, no one will be allowed to wander around the village", says Bardina.
It's a rare glimpse into everyday life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 seniors were forced to vote in a public outcry in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the provinces were officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city, where you can get 90 minutes from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabira, followed by a five-hour stomach-swallowing drive.
The public transportation system is not working here.
The town of 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, woolen tiles in shades of gray and carved.
Very few Indonesians, especially journalists, and virtually no foreigners visited this place.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the local people worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses", says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-woven turban, dark shirt, and shiny skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia - 28 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and its child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in all of Asia.
But at the same time, Indonesia is a land of gold.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, U.S., is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky county about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports timber extraction worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuan people and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation by the New York Times in 2005 revealed that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The Papuans who call for self-government threaten this golden goose and are thus severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuan people have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass killings in the Papuan tribal area during the 1970s were tantamount to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - another report says that rape and electrocution are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", said Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch in Indonesia.
The situation was compounded by the fact that Papua's resources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83 percent are Christian, but the demographic is changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixture of vegetables and peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
"Imigrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans", explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura for work.
The original inhabitants of Papuy - the mom-mama (women) - lost their jobs.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations in his 2014 presidential campaign.
A former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice", You said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Jakovi, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs at a camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles emerged from the dark of night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the tone and the tone of the speech, and later returned with four other soldiers, local priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a state of shock pursued a group of children and beat them with their guns, victims and witnesses reported.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby election commission building, and things got even worse the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a soccer field outside the local police station and military headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial bows and performed the waita dance - a dance that runs in a circle and mimics the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
A few Protestants began throwing stones at buildings.
With escalating tensions, the soldiers were given an order via radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to fire", according to TIME, an official document whose contents were never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the threat and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one was paying attention to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of gunfire", he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him", said Johanna, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
I saw he was dead... and I kissed him.
The Papua police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only providing security for the station that was under attack.
'We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,' said a Papua police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many left with injuries.
The news of the murders was leaked to the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to address past violence.
But almost immediately, excuses began to ring.
Most of the violence has been committed for a long time.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 2000s.
I mean we're determined to punish these violent acts, but it won't be an easy task, he said.
However, in an interview with TIME on June 5 in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he had no plans to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that all cases would go to court.
Wiranto, who was accused of crimes against humanity by the UN after more than 1,000 people were killed in the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his statement with distrust.
'I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but I've never seen anything,' John said.
I'm tired.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
I'm afraid, as he says.
I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me.
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to speak about the incident.
He said he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the burial, the army started looking for me", he said.
And the shooting still goes on.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villages in nearby Deiyai.
The clash, in which one person was killed and 17 others injured, took place between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to a hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the society building.
According to police, villagers threw stones at the villagers and responded with a warning shot.
However, locals say that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were panicking, we were afraid of retaliation", said 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
I haven't been out of the house for two days.
The Deiyaik parliament has called for the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only exacerbates the isolation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Movement for the Liberation of Papua (OPM) - a rebel army that protects the rights of Papua's people by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In recent years, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents under the pretext of 'establishing national sovereignty'.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known to the people of Papua as a tragic and forgotten place.
Poverty is oil on fire.
The little rice that's sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still unattainable.
The inhabitants grow their own food: mostly sweet potatoes, fruits, and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each one cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the family, the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the Nabire airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began arriving, economic inequality between native and immigrant Papuan people has increased.
So few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education to start a business.
"Young people are moving out of villages due to lack of jobs and money", said John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The isolation has kept the province of Papua hidden from the world.
They also contribute to the strict rules for foreign journalists.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua due to lack of cooperation with the authorities, despite the fact that they had received such rare filming permits.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the most rebellious eastern and western parts of Papua are at great risk of not being granted visas and blacklisted", he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the Papuan case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the various and widespread acts of violence in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta that: In Indonesia, a democratic system still exists and the media are free, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.
Local people are calling for foreign governments to join.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baer, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals were chanting, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "We want freedom".
Indonesia is scheduled to hold another election in 2019, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he's surrounded by people connected to the Paniai shooting", said Gobau, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - besides living in constant fear of the invading army - are living in poverty, poor education and health care.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuan people, consider their vote a debt that Jokowi must pay.
"They don't want money, they want justice", he added.
Despite threats and intimidation from the families of the victims of the panic shooting, they continue their last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", Yacobus said, his head down.
What can we do?
The French Navy has seized a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
The four crew members of the ship, which is believed to be made up of Lithuanian and Latvian people, were arrested during the raid.
The boat, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was taken to a port in Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going and to expose the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures taken to stop large quantities of drugs entering Australia", said its executive director Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for drug traffickers because of its high street drug prices.
The country is also facing a growing problem of drug addiction.
This is not the first strike of the last few days.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia while attempting to cross the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded to drink.
This may be a problem in nursing homes, and the solution, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic of the Prague Paul Mádlová General Faculty Hospital, could be an infusion of a physiological solution that is sprayed with a thin needle under the skin.
But they're only for medical facilities.
The older you get, the lower the amount of water in your body.
"And they also lose their thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluid and become dehydrated very quickly", said Mother.
Two liters should be drunk.
"But getting in an old man with so much fluid is a big problem", she added.
She says that in nursing homes, there's often no doctor who can look after it.
In hospitals, they usually treat dehydration with infusions.
"I think they should be introduced gradually there too, so they can get subcutaneous infusions", she said.
She says that older people can be given up to two and a half liters of the physiological solution a day.
A lack of fluid can cause nausea, headaches and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused", she added.
If neglected, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood clots and clogs the vessels in the brain, and kidney failure is also at risk.
The patients lying should not be covered with a pillow, maximum cotton cloth.
One-off plugs can also be a problem.
"It's more difficult to treat, but it's ideal to expose the patient and let the skin breathe out", the doctor said.
The Torch has already burned down in Dubai for the second time
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers caught fire on Friday, forcing firefighters to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This is the second fire in the last two years in this tall building, aptly named The Torch.
All occupants of the building have been evacuated and no injuries have been reported.
We were asleep and the alarm went off and we heard screams.
It took us 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor", Geroge, a skyscraper resident, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defence said firefighters managed to bring the fire under control around 4am (0:00 GMT) as they continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for disabled residents.
The incident could again spark a debate about the safety of materials used to coat tall buildings around the world.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the area of the TORCH to which the Commission refers.
British police said the insulation and enclosure system of London's Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed nearly 80 people.
The survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the United States carry prohibited items on board an aircraft
A survey of passengers found that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the U.S. Government Transportation Security Administration checkpoint on board the plane, and at least six percent of passengers boarded the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they found out late that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of a survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who confessed to knowingly attempting to travel with an item prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand hours loaded compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped the attention of the TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through the guard, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men also admitted to intentionally carrying prohibited drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it was conducting a survey of passengers worldwide to find out how many of them accidentally and intentionally carried unauthorised items through airport control.
It is not surprising that most people who carry unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company stressed, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids or quantities they can put into an airplane.
It is therefore not surprising that the TSA seized the largest amount of prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA would treat books the same way it would deal with smuggled goods.
Fluid handling is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA Director Scott Pruitt on the delay of the Obama administration's planned emission reduction guidelines
After 15 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency, its chief Scott Pruitt rescinded his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's carbon reduction plan.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan, which is more responsive than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge brought against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the deadline set for 1 October, when States should start implementing the 2015 Regulation on the reduction of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid interference with local decisions or threatened economic growth.
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden mid-term shift is the biggest legal failure on Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA enforcer exceeded his authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration's plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and reinforced the EPA's commitment to cooperate with states through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within a given time frame.
"The previous EPA administration often missed deadlines and waited for prosecution by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up plans", said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA.
We don't believe in court settlement and we take deadlines seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it.
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use the possibility of delay and any other legally available authorities to ensure that regulations are based on sound policies and the most accessible information.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of ozone regulations.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group had no intention of allowing it to go under legal pressure.
"The EPA's decision to reverse the lawsuit is a major victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution", Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcome Pruitt's sudden change with great enthusiasm.
"It is worrying what pressure is being put on us to change the mindset of those responsible and protect the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
We must continue to fight the ideological pull of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests.
He's spit on a man with acid, yet he's not dangerous in court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family and you're laughing, the next, your whole life is changing from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopher of Great Britain, whose face was stained with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christopheros.
Andreas got up and said he was going to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door delivering Christmas presents to the family that day.
Instead, he was to be surprised with a cruel surprise.
A man he'd never seen before, immediately after opening it, without warning, poured acid on it, saying, "This is for you, buddy".
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart and I felt only the unreal pain on my skin", says Andreas.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but there his family learned the terrible news - doctors said he had no chance of survival.
Within weeks of the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the affected faces were the ones that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of his eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes", he described his suffering.
Christopheros has 12 operations to go on today, which are far from the last.
According to plastic surgeons, injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment.
Even after a difficult and long-term treatment, the victims' tissues remain scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and they fight deformity and deformity all their lives", said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man must have mixed it with someone.
The perpetrator believed he was seeking revenge on the man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police thoroughly investigated the case and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict, to the astonishment of the Christopheros family, changed dramatically.
"The three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be abolished as the man is not considered a threat to the public", Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of foodborne illnesses has increased significantly.
The Ministry of Interior there expressed its concern by proposing new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of cereals.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But victims of similar attacks will not give up.
They call on the UK government to impose stricter and longer prison sentences on those who attack their environment with acid or other food.
They also demand that stricter controls be placed on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops because they are different cleaning products.
In the United Arab Emirates' largest city, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, one of the world's largest residential buildings, caught fire last night.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence, the occupants of the 80-storey building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upstairs.
According to some residents, the opposite was true.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us", one of the tenants said.
Another tenant, quoted by Reuters, also said the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with the burning debris falling.
We were asleep.
The alarm went off, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get off the 50th floor", describes the tenant, George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the fires had engulfed about 40 apartments.
At least two cars were destroyed on the ground when burning parts of the building were hit.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
Witnesses in the surrounding buildings said the power went out.
A major fire damaged Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, no one was hurt because the residents were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and became the world's tallest residential building at 352 meters.
The record was broken the following year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The bodybuilder had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito found a wide range of illicit substances - from steroids to diuretics to medications for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him win the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing four years of probation and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record number for any athlete caught.
The three-time major league player said he started taking steroids a year before he failed bodybuilding.
The Cork of the Czech Republic.
She was hugging her ex-lover with passion!
Lucka Vondráčková has barely entered the Czech territory, she's in one wheel.
And he's also a beacon of attention wherever he comes.
The last time she fell in her arms was her former lover, Michael Long, with whom she had lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 at the time and she certainly did not want to hang her career on the nail.
So they went away, but they remained friends to this day.
And they did it at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
They both coincidentally matched in blue.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she grabbed her stomach.
Then they hugged each other and posed willingly to the photographers.
But their meeting was no coincidence, as they play a lovers' couple together in the new prime time series Captain Exner.
Islamists in the UK have been jailed for life for preparing an assassination.
A British court sentenced four members of an Islamist cell, called the Three Musketeers, to life imprisonment on Thursday, and the prosecutor's office said it was planning a terrorist attack on police and the military.
Four men, two of whom had attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities thought at the time that he was going to strike immediately.
In one of the men's cars, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with Arabic words for "infidels", and a gun model.
It happened as an MI5 agent placed a surveillance device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror that the defendants could cause if they were not stopped", said Sue Hemming, a prosecutor's deputy.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for parole after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed innocence and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 degrees on Hodonínsk.
Tuesday's record temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for just two days.
With the 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded at the Hodoninska Watch Tower, Thursday was the hottest day of the year so far.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But not much of a temperature record came down on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or evened at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures on Thursday.
For example, Thursday's temperature in the Guard was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In the Břeclavsk freezer, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in the Brno Hills, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the Guardian, were from 2013.
It was 10 degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures were observed on Thursday, mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard, the hottest heat was recorded in Dyjakovic in Znojemsk and Brodě nad Dyjom in Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record was not broken.
On the other hand, according to the CHMUM website, Thursday's peak temperatures in the western and northwestern Czech Republic were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there did not begin to rise until later this afternoon", meteorologists reported.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, and even more heavy rainfall could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, temperatures will remain high on Friday and in southeastern Moravia on Saturday.
China is short of tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of the visa policy.
For decades, China has tried to exert its influence without using force.
It spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry into foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
But that's not happening in Beijing.
State media there are talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic change and modernization.
However, the number of visitors to China last year increased by only 3.8 percent, and about 80 percent of visitors came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
This is partly because, despite its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, according to Christopher Balding, an economics professor at Beijing University, in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contacts with China, and the citizens of the other countries must get their visas in advance.
The Chinese offices in the United States are therefore comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait in line for hours, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that visa requirements reduce the number of visitors to a given country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and has less than one percent of the world's population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates the problem itself when it uses tourism to achieve its political goals, for example in its disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transportation to South Korea in the spring as part of a crackdown on South Korea's missile defense system, the South Koreans paid back and avoided China.
In May, visits dropped 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an 85 percent increase.
All of this is affecting macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the Fed, China could lose up to $190 billion in foreign travel to the Chinese, while China receives about $35 billion a year in foreign exchange sales to incoming tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, China had a $217 billion deficit in tourism last year, which is 44 percent of China's total trade surplus.
A small number of tourists, therefore, strike a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously preventing capital flows.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint on foreigners.
In many parts of China, immigrants are virtually unheard of.
In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in China.
There are more in the United States and some cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific studies show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
But in China, they are virtually non-existent.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and ease visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the grassland zoo, they have bred deadly poisonous reptiles.
The SpongeBob Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
Visitors will only see all nine newly-born Turkish snakes in the exhibition so far.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters [2,000 feet].
"It grows to a meter in length", described zoo spokesman Martin Vobrobro.
The young of the other two species, the death-bearers and the red cobras, will gain strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't tell people when they'll see them yet.
"We would hate to lose them", said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
The Australian carrier snakes have been born to eight, descended from a breeding pair from a population in the Sydney area.
"The only thing visitors can see in the exhibition is the deadly beetles from around Perth", said Vobrouba, adding that human care requires the deadly beetles to be frozen for 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
100% success was associated with the African spitting cobras.
A couple at the Plane Zoo hatched four eggs, four young in all.
"The incubation lasted 65 days", added the Vobobrou.
In nature, this species sprays poison to its victims at a distance of up to four meters.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse mushrooms in the zoo.
In 40 days in the garden, they expect the young to be weaned from the black mamba's litter, and the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unauthorized transcript of the phone call, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico over the payment beyond the border wall.
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the top officials of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president accused him of publicly condemning the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press".
Trump, as part of his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. oversight agreement for refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid", and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came into effect under President Obama - he would look like a "drugged-out" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the United States.
Trump ended the call after Turnbull explained that this was my most unpleasant call of the day.
Tusk testified again at the D.A. about Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear", said the brother of the late president, the chairman of the PiS Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczyński, in a Tusk address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not scare me", Tusk replied, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
As they left the Prosecutor's Office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk on TVN 24 to chant Donald Tusk! and wished the politician 100 Years!
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczyński will not scare me".
He says he doesn't blame prosecutors, but he has no doubt that justice is meant to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, opposition or people they don't like, and I'm afraid I belong to that group.
He was interrogated for the second time.
The prime minister was questioned by the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time about the mistake in the autopsy of the victims of the smolensk disaster.
In addition, there was a mix of bodies in the coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must be a reason for that.
And the reason was because they were afraid of the scandal, because it would weigh on Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should have helped Donald Tusk become a very important person in the EU", Kaczyński said on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, which Poland has absolutely nothing to gain.
Kaczyński also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could be different, but he hadn't noticed.
Tusk was questioned by the prosecutor's office for eight hours on April 19.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summonses to interrogation were considered part of the apparent attempt by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office shall be subordinate to the Minister of Justice in Poland, who shall act as the Prosecutor General.
The summons for questioning came shortly after Tusk was elected President of the European Council, whom Kaczyński tried to prevent, but failed, including during a visit by Merkel to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydła finally protested alone.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw on the brink.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the Chambers from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a bill that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update and is currently in comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for a member of parliament abroad.
'Since the last update of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes to be taken into account in these lists', the Ministry explains its approach.
"New representative offices have been established in some countries, some have been closed down, or there has been a change in the level of representation", the document states.
The Declaration contains two Annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in the neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than 100 other Czech authorities will receive a press release.
Their list is changing with the announcement.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also withdrew its representation in Bamaku, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are new to the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar, Senegal and Lusaka, Zambia.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its presence to include the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's S'-Cchuan province.
Voting tickets will also be available to registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czech Republic has had four times the opportunity to elect its deputies in the chambers of representation or consulates abroad.
Before each election, the state election commission shall draw a lottery to determine the district for which candidates are voted in abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when South Moravian candidates were chosen.
In the next two elections, Czechs abroad were elected among the South Czech candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Czech Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people voted, in 2006 there were about 6,700, and four years later, 8,222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters arrived at the embassies.
The Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists remembered the racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed the viewing population of Monroe, Georgia and headed toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stopped the car.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled out of his cigarette for a long time and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
We want this n--and Roger!
Bring him to me!
The silence interrupts the screaming of a young black man being pulled from the driver's seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events of July 22.
But when one of the men crosses Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has ever been convicted of murder.
It's amazing that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity, - Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction, was heard.
It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event is a dramatic call to action, reminding the Monroe community every year that justice was not done enough.
"We demand a prosecution and a closing of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all", Brooks said.
Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be started.
A coroner's office covers one of the bodies of the lynchings at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to participate in the lynching.
But no one has been prosecuted.
Although the suspects remain in the wild for decades, civil rights activists claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the townspeople.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court granted black citizens of Georgia the right to vote in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer elections that, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed the white landowner Barnett Hester during a fight, allegedly for his wife's sake.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was a tradition that Hester lived with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, then-major white landowner Loy Harrison filed a $600 bail for Malcolm.
Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
On their way home from prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turned out, Harrison planned and orchestrated the murder, "the FBI has inferred.
It is also clear that a secret agreement was reached between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynching but also disposed of the evidence and concealed the identities of the witnesses.
Brooks has been more brief on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote", he said.
The murders always had a clear message for all black locals: This is what you'll end up with if you register and go vote.
The annual reconstruction of the Moore's Ford Bridge event has been organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is vivid, engaging and fitting, showing a deep-seated racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and even more difficult is turning your eyes away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to deal with the unpleasant feelings that lie within each of us", Greene said.
But we can't have a relationship unless you hear what I've been through.
The main rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest black - were brought into the room, where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is serving as assistant director.
For many years he was the leader of the Kuklux Klan, but he says the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it contradicts who I am", Marbaugh said.
I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.
Actor Darrius Bradshaw and actor Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm, as Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcolm makes a deal with Hester and accuses him of sleeping with his wife.
Get off my property!
Rascona is not possible.
There's a fight going on.
At that moment, everyone (or at least every black actor) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
What happened? He asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I being too rude?
No, Greene's cheer is the answer.
I just don't think white people used to say "n-r" in that tone.
That's right, one of the black actors is gonna be a little bit of a jerk.
You need to put more emphasis on R.
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just enough to make it enough for four victims to be massacred.
The actors are repeating the scene.
Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word N this time.
No one laughs anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The screaming, the shooting... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors singing the sad song "Strange Fruit" by Billie Holiday.
Every word in the room is a feeling of sadness.
Behind the scenes, about a dozen spectators sweat and tears from their eyes.
There's practically the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple traveled all the way from Ithaca, New York, with many watching from the surrounding area.
Each of them can withstand the local humid weather for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a crowd to Malcolm and Dorsey's tombs.
Up until this point, the murders could have been viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites the crowd watching to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel on their victims' heads, watch fake blood and immobile bodies and whisper something in their ears.
They're not dead, they're a little boy.
It's a few minutes away and Greene thanks the audience.
The actors are cleaning the rope and wiping their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaug, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kuklux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; eventually, he is emotionally drawn.
It's okay, one of the women whispers.
We know you're good at this.
But you had a reason.
Later that day, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a young white couple are talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could barely find words to express her feelings about today's show.
"It's hard to listen to those ugly words and watch those ugly acts... done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you", she said for the reconstruction.
It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue, adding to what's called police clashes.
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
In his own words, he's already planning a show for next year.
"Re-creating these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we have had to live through - but it's also a time to reflect", he said.
If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know or study their country's history are doomed to repeat it.
I love the instructions.
One of my friends says he only reads the instructions.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's a modern art form, often a pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the days of a long time ago, when the instruction to use anything was rather a rare indication.
So my first gramophone, for example, contained only one piece of paper, and it had hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some parts, all of them had some secret markings.
When something inside of me got messed up years later, I offered that sheet to a shaman who was not afraid to screw the back plate.
He gave me a rough guide on what the labyrinth of paper with the stripes was for.
Yes, it was a regular aid to chronic toilet paper depletion.
He found a wire that was disconnected and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl records again.
The new age has brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the overgrown grape was simply stuck, required about ten pictures.
A sketch was especially made out of how to get one piece into another.
The administration was two-way, and no other procedure was possible.
To give it the opposite required considerable effort, with the need to remove certain plastic parts.
My contempt for the manual ended up in my Seat Leon self-defense.
The year 2003 produced a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including, inter alia, the replacement of the flashlight.
It was easy.
Three steps in total and the job was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to mention that while the light bulb on the right went to change really only in three steps.
1 separate the cover.
2. scrape out a broken light bulb and scrape out a new one.
3rd layer of the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem with the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the upper right limb into the belly of the car I would be able to pull a spring, a screw, to easily remove the cover, and then I would be able to follow the points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
It's a mistake on the couch.
There was no room for that cover, no room for the skinny hand of Cinderella, let alone the fat Sling.
I lost half an hour of my life, and I lost it without any success.
The situation was further compounded by my wife's entrance into the garage, which was summoned by the noise and words that she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked inexcusably.
My answer took about 90 seconds, but if I omit vulgar terms, there were only two words left to publish.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked with a sentence that might be her last in a long-term relationship.
I explained the problem to her slowly, with a focus on the torture of the author of the manual, where the blessing of the iron on the hand that wrote the manual, after her being blinded so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to the wide range of Cláudio's instructions on the witch, including his commissioned burning on a hill above the Castle of Losa.
"How about unmounting the box?" said the woman dismantling the battery.
In desperation, it happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right-hand side.
I thought nothing would surprise me.
And that was the day my colleague called, who was just recovering from a collapse after checking out two FDA officials.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the industry and who can tell wild stories with an uninterrupted voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having a handwashing manual hung on it", he told me in a low voice.
I gradually got rid of the whole problem that was just above the sink in the patient's bathroom, and he didn't have a picture guide on how to wash his hands.
His argument to the commissioner that adults can usually wash their hands and that not having to use pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people had no healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that", she told him.
He understood that simply washing the soaped hands with running water was a primitive action at the Chromon level, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ritual in ten steps.
So you need to tell them that you need to let the tap water out.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end, the happy finding is that the person washed his hands exactly as the SUKL shooter tells him.
Finally, I must say that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the toilet.
The procedure for defecation is uniform, there is no problem, and for urination, given the differences between the sexes, instructions two will be required.
The problem remains with these pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure also means drawing an accurate picture of all the anatomical details, which could cause some outrage in a rash toilet visitor, despite finally finding out that he has been digging the hole in the wrong way his whole life.
Pearson is laying off 3,000 more employees and cutting dividends in an effort to revive business.
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off 3,000 more employees and cut its dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme to change its business model.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting programme to revive falling trade due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a one percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh city district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a hermit mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in its statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a local person with a homemade explosive device.
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are not life-threatening and are in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the reporting, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO Allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% of the victims died in the capital.
At least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in the Shia district of Kabul in late July.
The Taliban have reported the attack.
On May 31, a major explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining an already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops who should help military and police forces in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks that he has carried out in recent weeks have shaken public confidence in the government, its decree and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reviewed its decision to postpone smoking rules in response to the lawsuit.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed its decision to delay the Obama administration's law, which ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to transpose the 2015 Ozone Standards on Wednesday night, stating that it was presenting the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their views", EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA was trying to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on the measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most of the Democratic states, including Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday arguing that the EPA's actions were illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words, in an attempt to kick economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have prompted countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA states on its website that breathing ozone-containing air can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár was shot and bleeding!
This, a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this hitherto almost unknown singer hosted a monstrous event in Czech affairs, hosted by such leading figures as Master Karel Gott, Lucie White, Simone Kraina and a host of others, and hosted by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple: to show off to the public and present his music video for the song Sarah, whose baptism was attended by the just-named personalities.
But few people know that the video itself, which was filmed in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first major film with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it didn't go without a proper trap.
Sarah's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramatic nature of the scene, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a blow to the head.
But at one point, he hit him so hard and straight in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, immediately blood came out of my nose", Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the market was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav failed to respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury wasn't serious enough to affect the continuation of the filming.
We're bringing you the video of the young artist, you can also see the scene of the blow.
The unspoken version with blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko were talking at a meeting about the possibility of a duel between them.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could have staged the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each was in a separate room at ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia - the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion - went down to the hall to greet Lomachenka, the World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled his right arm and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with that.
Lomačenko defends his title Saturday at 7:00 p.m. against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN.
Boxers pose for photographers and Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a perfect test.
"I'm a former world champion in the featherweight division", Garcia adds.
I had to gain weight for the match with Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm too small for my 63 kg.
I'd like to get back to the lightweight category.
The little girl has to get fat again to get a little light weight... and then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not give it to them?
The crusher agrees.
This match would be good for boxing.
Lomachenko is due to make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in a match against the eventual winner of the Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title on September 23 at the Forum Arena.
"The match should be in a pay-per-view style, fans demand", Garcia said, who later said the possibility of broadcasting the match via the TV station that comes with the best deal was open.
We're the main attraction.
No one else will attract that much attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity...
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an amazing boxer and could attend his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko didn't let Garcia's praise go unpunished when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looks very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about the knockout.
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt rising tension in front of each other.
You won't forget this game.
No other match will attract so much attention.
And I'd be very happy to put it on fire, Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey".
It's going to be a great game.
A young couple vanished 12 years ago without a trace.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
Extensive searching has been underway, but without success.
And the police finally closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple were unsure what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad end of the story has come.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Čeboksara, Čuvašsko.
Only the documents left in the car allowed the police to identify a couple.
The documents have survived a decade underwater, without which it would have taken the police much longer to identify the ones found.
The couple was last seen when Zyrnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his find to Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading along the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be published after its completion.
The latest results of the tests for the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new age-assessment method show that over 80 percent of those surveyed were over 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess asylum seekers more accurately in the context of the assessment of asylum applications.The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
As of today, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) were assessed as being over 18 years of age, while in 25 other cases the Forensic Medical Agency assessed that the respondent was possibly over 18 years of age.
In 423 other cases, it was decided that the respondent was possibly younger than 18.
Tests shall only be taken if the age of the person in question is questionable.
According to Johan Gørransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"The statistics are in the same order as last month, and the numbers are very similar", he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated at over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that the person in question was 18 years of age or older.
Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 this year.
Criticism was also met with the medical method of ageing, which includes wisdom teeth X-rays and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are then evaluated by dentists and X-ray specialists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who studies, among other things, the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which they reached puberty.
I had reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of age measurements are right.
The biological age assessment is in a sense very uncertain.
If we can't determine the exact age, we shouldn't pretend otherwise, he told the Metro.
The Agency's forensic medical agency, GÃ¶ransson, defended the decision by saying: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump threatened to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in a January phone call that he would not meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay for the US-Mexico wall.
Trump said in the interview that the funding would be arranged somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump has also spoken openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to a transcript of an interview published Thursday by the Washington Post.
Trump made building the wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of the top promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump took office, he undiplomatically rebuked Pena Nieto for being critical of his wall-building plan.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government will never pay behind the wall.
"You can't tell the press", Trump repeatedly said in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to issue defiant statements.
He says he's gonna figure out a way to fund it and it's gonna work out.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet you guys anymore because that's unacceptable to me", Trump said, according to the American daily.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it's probably the most important.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after he took office.
Mexico has refused to finance the construction of a 3,200-kilometer wall, which has severely strained relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be funded by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's January 28 phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
He was led to this conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in return for the United States to accept people from the Pacific island states' internment facilities.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later he agreed to it.
"You can certainly say this is not the deal you made, but you're going to have to stick to it", Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost joyous, for example when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me", Trump joked.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation got sharper.
"I hate to take these people in", Trump noted.
I assure you, they're wrong.
That's why they're in prison now.
"They won't be great people going to work for local dairy farmers", he said.
In an interview, he also pointed out that a refugee could become a Boston assassin in five years.
Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world leaders in late January, about a week after he arrived at the White House, often several times in one day.
The conversation with Turnbull ended up being the least pleasant of the day.
Before concluding, he noted that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier.
They executed Rana's killer in front of a crowd.
Her father watched.
The execution took place in the square in the Yemeni capital Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little girl Ran Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body and dumped it near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has affected a country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd who gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father expressed his feelings to the media after the execution.
I feel like I'm born again.
I'm relieved to be here.
It's a new day in my life.
The rest of the family were present, shouting "Justice Live!" with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van, from which he was stripped.
The cops put him on his stomach tied up.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and fired from nearby.
The crowd was celebrating every shot that was fired.
Mr. Almatari told MailOnline that justice was served in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed", he added.
I was standing in San's Square of Liberation waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice was done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful madness, the killer would be caught and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Huthis.
Maghrabi was initially sentenced to 100 lashes shortly after his arrest, but his actions sparked such outrage that the judge decided to impose the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Ran's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his home, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could be his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the Wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the wounds that carried Ranina's body were terrible", he told the media.
"The girl disappeared this afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture hung everywhere", he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the parents of the murderers who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10 or 15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We've been looking everywhere, but Rana's gone.
We were walking around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking in vain.
Residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.
A Justice Department representative read the investigation to the crowd to calm them down.
The accused apparently did not regret his actions.
Just before his sentence, the police read the sentence to him, but the condemned man only looked at his executioner for a moment.
The whole thing was taped for national television, but there were a lot of tapes on the Internet that the crowd took.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of party.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a meeting of President Trump that he was moving to a different party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their backs on me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today, as a citizen of West Virginia, that I can no longer support you as a Democratic governor".
The crowd of onlookers burst into joy.
"I'm running for the Republican nomination tomorrow", Justice added.
As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game.
Trump has already promised the people of West Virginia a major announcement.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying: "The departure of the Justice Governor is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of trying to lift our country up".
"For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the smallest legislature in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the final straw for the already-deceased leaderless party, which is striving in vain to find a positive and unifying message", RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for sincerely apologizing for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the right time for Russia to return to the world of sports.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - held on the eve of the MS athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was the right thing to do and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals this way.
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think we have seen very honest answers and presentations today", IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation.
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today was a great day and we've moved on to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to keep the punishment imposed on Russia", Coe added.
In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest athletes.
The athletics world championships, which begin on Friday in London, will be contested under a neutral flag by 19 athletes from Russia who have met the IAAF's strict rules.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
Drugs tests are still ineffective and exclusion coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF Council's presentation.
The state contract for CzechTrade was awarded to the company of the same name, which is being prosecuted by the state.
The public contract for the state export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta by František Savov.
Officials gave him 100% on all qualitative criteria.
They were not bothered that the Czech state was suing Savov for tax fraud and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade issued a public procurement contract for the four-year period for the provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal in April.
The contract for a total value of 30 million crowns was awarded to the publishing house of entrepreneur Franz Savov's Young Front.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are pursuing him for the escape.
Savov has fled to Britain and the Czech Republic is demanding his release.
The server Aktuálně.cz alerted to the case.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade was to decide on the award of the contract from 60% of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion was of great help to Savov's firm.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all the sub-criteria of quality.
This is what ultimately put her ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated at a rate of 404 900 crowns a month, the VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a sub-average rating of 62 points from the evaluators in all qualitative criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consultancy firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, together with Aktuálně.cz, is part of the Economia publishing house.
VLM raised several objections to the tender result, arguing that its assessment was unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their rejection, it was decided to contest the competition with the EEA Competition Authority.
It is considered that CzechTrade acted in breach of the law.
'The tenderer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision to select the tenderer on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favourable to the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the tenderer and other suppliers,' states the tender application submitted to the EEAS this week, which was published by the server Aktually.
According to VLM CEO and Chairman of the Board Michael Klimy, the selection committee's score appears to be unreliable and the 100% assessment of the Young Front project by all its members to be extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success by one of the contestants unlikely and suspicious", he told Aktuals Klima.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public procurement before it is concluded.
All information about the contract you mentioned is published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the Contractor and in the Public Procurement Journal.
"After the contract is concluded, a full written report will be published, but during the contract we cannot comment on its progress", said the agency's media representative, Stepan Dlouhý, to Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded with a statement that it considered extremely problematic that the publisher Economia had interfered with a competition where it had its own business interests.
However, this fact was stated in that Article.
In the tender, it may have been helpful that she had provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013 by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, led by Mr Martín Cuba ODS.
Mr. Savov blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive tax deductions by his companies, which caused the Czech State an alleged damage of up to 770 million kroner.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence Mafra publishing is.
A London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, and we have not received any information from the UK on the acquisition of the power of law of the judgment to date", the spokeswoman for the Prague city prosecutor's office, Stefanka Zenklová, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to his ownership of the Young Front, Savov was also involved in the Cyprus-based Harvestor Limited, which controlled the Czech brewery Samson, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is a profiling investment fund buying off the assets.
He's also supposed to own a bankrupt Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, that owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov has also been linked to the expropriation of property from the former Socialist Youth League.
The motorcyclist ran down the sidewalks and the park, ended up in a dumpster.
The motorcyclist caught attention by taking a careless ride through the streets, sidewalks and park alleys in Ushowitz.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to run away towards Stanovište.
"Police officers pursued men with great caution in the city when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariana Lakes and rode his motorcycle into the field where he crashed", police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
Eventually, an ambulance helicopter had to arrive to transport the injured motorcyclist to the Plzeň hospital.
Later, police found that the driver had a false driver's license, that the motorcycle's license plate had been stripped of, that his production number had been erased, and that the production label itself had been removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
"The breathing test ruled out the presence of alcohol on the driver's spot, but the test found a positive result for methamphetamine", the police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not in any way affect Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint Germain in France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be imposed by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The rules of financial fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid a transfer of 222 million euros just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will be demanding a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar's move to France.
Since PSG is funded by a wealthy Qatari family who made a fortune selling energy, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
The clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but they must also demonstrate legitimate sources of income, which allows them to cover the regulatory costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he was appointed UEFA Director in 2007.
A former French player believed that clubs that went into debt in pursuit of new jobs would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP's rules shifted its focus from club debt to the monitoring of its losses.
This change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a potential club and spending huge sums on players and building a global brand - suddenly wasn't as profitable.
The Commission considers that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor that is not a market economy investor.
And despite Platini having to leave office in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Čeferin, is determined to advocate a ban on overspending.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future", Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP compliance, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a one-off payment, it can allocate the amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be redeemed at EUR 44,4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of FFP's highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 alongside Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi Group.
PSG was fined EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and ordered to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25.
UEFA is watching out for teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through club-owner-linked companies.
Therefore, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
The Commission also notes that the measures provided for in Article 107 (1) TFEU are in line with the principle of proportionality.
Some reports suggest that Neymar's share of PSG's income could be paid by the MS organising committee for the 2022 Qatar Football Championship.
However, PSG and the officials of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar have denied the fact that Neymat should become the FIFA World Cup ambassador and that such a maneuver would be easily exposed by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules,
According to a statement by the dedicated persons on Tuesday, UEFA has not launched any investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wanted to remain anonymous as he was not authorised to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a market economy investor that is not a market economy investor.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of the jerseys.
The club has signed a contract promising a turnover increase of up to 30 percent.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, have sought to curb Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG is violating FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' by the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports mogul, shares La Liga's same stance on financing the club.
"It's the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football over the last 15 years", Wenger said Thursday.
Once the club's owner becomes a state, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, as the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club.
The changes are painful, but we must believe.
16,000 cheering fans on their feet.
Tom the Rosicrucian is going to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan defender was playing the Red Star game, he made up a few goals, but his teammates didn't aim for the black.
The summer team, packed with new multi-million-strong teams, is ending after the opening double in the European Cup.
Was it hard to do anything after the Belgrade game?
After the goal was scored, four shots were needed, which was hard for us.
We wanted to at least keep up, build confidence, have something to push ourselves to the next game.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why hasn't Sparta been able to get into the game for so long?
The game is terribly crafted.
The rival combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we fired one shot in half an hour.
Of course, that's a very small amount of money when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we were able to play them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponents into these positions more often.
Is it a problem with the large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new team.
We've only played three competitive games and the lineup is changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect eleven to sit.
Is it encouraging to you that you've already played parts of two matches in a row?
It's still just a part of the game.
I don't know how my condition is going to develop or when I'm finally going to be able to play again.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's like an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will get worse.
Fans came in large numbers again, but they left in disgrace.
What can you tell them?
There was another amazing visit, just like with Bohemian.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come to next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember seeing people like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be a benefit to the league?
We're fighting ourselves, playing games, so that's not an advantage for us.
The businessman is serving a 10-year sentence for tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Tomán, who is to serve 10 years in prison for tax evasion.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in the complaint that the justice had violated his fundamental rights, and the findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Court judges found the complaint unfounded, the CCP found from the court's database.
The Court of Appeal is no longer an appeals court.
'It cannot, as the fourth instance, examine the acts or legal errors allegedly committed by the courts of general jurisdiction unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,' the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was upheld by the Olomouc High Court.
At that time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where he was also, according to the decision, at the time of the decision of the Court of Auditors.
The penalty imposed is above the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court has described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million kroner was caused in the period from January to July 2008 alone, and the total leakage, according to experts, exceeded one billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to prosecute Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Service did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of the monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in mere statistical amounts.
World Servis and some of the companies the company was trading with have ties to businessman Radomir Vybyral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison by the justice for tax evasion in the motor vehicle business.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer of Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string.
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the famous 1980s characters; the dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and of course, the modern era, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd spread out into bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it's a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
But from the French perspective, it looks like someone's running out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of the talking vegetable can that H. Jon Benjamin told).
The authors have moved away from the main humorous points - middle-aged actors playing teenage high-pitched children - and could not have drawn on past events.
The continuation of Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, doesn't push so much on the emotional level and satire is sometimes sporadic, including parodies of 1990s thrillers like Hand on Crib.
At one point, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbook wrecks, roller skates and a bunch of other 1991 stuff.
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The benevolent Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still has not been able to boast of his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a lady.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (aka Mr. Showalter), who is being encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the many side stories.
It's especially fun to watch the ever-young, long-haired Rud, alias the character Matt Dillon from the movie The Young Ones, whose once-respected character Andy is now an old-fashioned poppy.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, like the recurring series Seven Up, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical breakdown: Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, when the last scene of the entire band is set to premiere Summer of Insomnia.
Comrade Detective on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of the series "So-So-Normal Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde: No Regrets", and even the series "GLOW", which clashes icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes.
The comedy by creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to act as a television set: a drama about two București police officers from Romania in the 1980s, who fight for truth and atheism in the style of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, who have been dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (the series' executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (like cops watching chess on TV - parodies of American football).
The series has been voiced by many well-known actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But Comrade Detective is too focused on a disreputable propaganda drama - including a Reagan-masked killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too exciting and comedic moments aren't enough.
In a shorter run, the propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, where two fat men are eating hamburgers in a large crowd.
A clear message to the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn anything into food and orgy.
The Romanian creators' ideas were right: we do the same with our own culture as they do with theirs.
The IAAF's suspension of the start of the race has not been lifted by the Russian athletes.
The International Athletic Federation (IAAF) confirmed at its congress in London that an international ban on Russian athletes from racing has been extended due to a state-sponsored doping programme.
The vote on the history of the World Cup, which begins on Friday, has been very clear as expected.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 voting against.
The main reason for the rejection is, above all, the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as stated by the head of the IAAF Special Investigative Group, Rune Andersen, before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have yet to be heard, and coaches with a disgraced reputation still work in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the World Anti-Doping Agency's standards, is not yet fully functional.
However, RUSADA can now carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done", said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes missed the Rio Olympics last year.
Despite the upcoming ban, 19 Russians will participate, who have already demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a longer period.
But they won't be able to start the championship in national colors and if they win, they won't be able to play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England will maintain the interest rate at 0,25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged following a lack of prominent economic growth and a weakening inflation rate which has led to speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be undermined by interest rate maintenance - despite the stifling family budgets.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two to maintain the interest rate at 0.25%.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecast growth to 1.7 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, and warned that the family budget cuts would continue.
The Bank also indicated that growth due to Brexit inflation would occur over the next few years and that rents from mobility would rise more than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was to support the economy and was put into effect a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Funds Plan, which will offer low-cost subsidies to banks, should start to apply from next February, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
The Bank stated: MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, together with pressures on real household income and burdens on consumption.
On the subject of rates, the Bank stated that it would be necessary to tighten monetary policy belts to calm inflation, at a rate higher than market expectations.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be both permissible and limited.
The Bank has reduced its growth forecast for this year and next year from 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The forecast growth of 1,8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.31 and 0.4 percent to $1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after disappointing growth buried hopes for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three months.
The growth is likely to remain at 0,3% in the third quarter, although the bank said it would increase slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a bit of a comfort to households affected by rising inflation and miserable wage increases.
The report further states that monetary policy cannot prevent income declines in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise sharply towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to the high interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after the rate was cut to 0.025% in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to drop.
The Bank estimates that a full price-economy union will take at least four years.
Before the bank's latest rate decision, many demanded a rate hike along with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households.
Inflation fell back to 2.6 percent last month from 2.9 percent in June, despite the Bank's announcement that it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun relative to the 2% target was entirely due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start competing for contracts with a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are ending existing contracts and re-mortgage - with no fees and low interest rates they prefer.
The NHS is prescribing a controversial HIV cure to 10,000 patients.
Patients will be granted access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September on the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court on funding the NHS.
The NHS has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 per cent, will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients over a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court decision last year stating that the NHS had the financial means to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from Director-General Simon Stevens as 'a significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as 'a decisive moment'.
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start admitting patients, with additional clinics to join in October and full deployment across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient' s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken daily or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving treatment.
Clinics will designate eligible participants who will sign their consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the relevant treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and to apply for potential participation in testing.
The programme comes with taxpayers £10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and large-scale implementation.
Simon Stevens added: This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in over 30 years of efforts to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust, said: "We are witnessing a defining moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if given correctly and to patients at risk, will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
From September, the NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and does not require a partner to be persuaded, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We welcome this declaration.'
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The number one priority must be rapid deployment of the tests across the country; we must ensure that they are available to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and together stop the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on high ground: the mid-levels and the clever design turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a real estate passion, traded a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Cour in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - a prime example of modern design that makes the most of available space.
"I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood", Joanne said.
I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it was the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him immediately and I fell in love with him the same day.
Since then, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to use a high ceiling.
I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and plenty of light.
That's what I wanted, she said.
To this end, she employed Erfana Azadi of design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used a nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not so high that two gaps could be climbed over it - a challenge for architects was to create a middle floor on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated", he explained.
We had to arrange both spaces so we could walk upright.
It was not only a simple platform to build, but also to bend the steel structure so that it would be in the correct height above and below the ceiling.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to build two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
In the middle, he overlooks the beautiful living room with an old bronze window frame of the Retrouvius design.
The mirrored gold-colored furniture, the silver lines and the Serge Mouille retro mirror create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramatic, space-based and lighting.
The short corridor is covered in mirrors on both sides and looks so long.
The mirrored leaves in the kitchen look like a window into another room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces with mirrors for storing appliances and glass.
The advantage of a living room that gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space is the ability to separate it from the kitchen when not in use.
The kitchen is not new.
But what's unique about this solution is the door locks.
"We had to solve the technical side", Erfan says of the reinforced air-conditioned doors.
The doors are fitted with anti-lock so that they can be unlocked very easily.
With the clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square feet [16 m], a second room, and a better overall layout.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is residential space - or the valuation of your property", Erfan said.
The real estate agent will basically calculate the price of the apartment when entering the apartment based on the living area.
In this case, the living area was increased while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
"Material is very important because you touch it and you create an emotional bond with your home", Erfan added.
You don't like the electrical wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won't win your heart.
As it turns out, a high-quality design and enhancement of living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional piece of work.
And like Joanne, you may decide to stay.
The United States is coming together.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is widening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and issued a retaliatory travel ban on its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a complete ban, U.S. citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
It's California that has banned the use of state money on the travels of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly LGBT-friendly, and it considers any expression of disapproval of LGBT lifestyle discrimination.
Tennessee, however, passed a law on the reservation of conscience that says that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with LGBT community patients has no obligation to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide those patients with another therapist who has no such problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that state-run religious charities that have adopted children from mothers after birth are not required to provide these children for adoption by same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objectors laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travel to eight states from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California professors cannot get their science symposium tickets paid for by their universities, for example, in Texas, because they're co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants for their travel, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund travel from state A to state B or private sponsorship.
Tennessee ran out of patience, and his parliament passed a bill that also said he didn't like California's high-tax, high-state spending, high-deficit, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but he still doesn't lift a travel embargo on California because of that.
He's using them as retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will be true of any State of the Union which would impose a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
He also called on all state parliaments to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, it's all constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass laws on reservation of conscience and to decide what their money is going to be used for and what they can't.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience reservation?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pigs, why can't he offer only beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why would you punish him by forcing pigs to sell him when there are enough butchers offering pigs?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a fine for refusing to bake a gay wedding cake.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the relevant cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies in non-federal jurisdictions according to their own, that is, according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there's the diversity, the diversity, the diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of life and let live that all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek not tolerance for themselves and others, but extreme intolerance for others.
They believe that no one should ever again express moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with LGBT lifestyles, and if they do, they should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know of any situation in American history where states have done this kind of thing for political reasons, except one case.
Even in the days of the struggle for black civil rights, when the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only exception was the 1950s, when slavery was a political cause, and the North was at war with the South.
Of course, nothing like this is happening now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between blue democratic and red republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally intertwined.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic got a fat penalty.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he intends to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin's incumbent head, Vladimir Putin, has not announced his candidacy yet, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling for demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's payroll later", the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian Election Commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the verdict politically motivated.
Fines of 300 thousand rubles, roughly 25 thousand rubles, the court on Thursday also imposed on two members of Navalny's pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolaj Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to protect Navalny in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to five years probation for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so powerful, Navalny's constitutional requirements prevent him from running.
The brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after their Italian family founded the empire, are losing one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has taken the joint property and business estate dispute all the way to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a heated dispute is constantly being fought in the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother, Anna, and his brothers, he owns a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars.
The Westco Jeans family founded the company here, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The money was used to purchase additional properties and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and suburban shopping centres.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is, according to Paul, the 'significant driving force and dominant figure' of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns $316 million in real estate, while Paul manages $176 million in real estate.
Paul's problem was the division of wealth and resources.
"Colin's proposal was in my eyes a strong favour for him", Paul wrote in a 2015 affidavit before the court.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court session was held.
The brothers are also now competing for control of an existing business - from which Paul, Colin said, was cut off.
Colin denies this is true and accuses Paul of mismanaging some property.
In a previous swearing-in, Colin stated that he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian background dictates that family is the most important thing", he wrote.
The costs of the court stand are rising, and hundreds of pages of swearing-in statements, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers from both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and candy shops from the 1950s onwards and bought shops in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money they got from the mortgage, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco in his senior year of college, Paul was a little boy, about 10 years old.
Anne de Lutis stated that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would go well.
Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court, she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family of companies.
As Paul, Luke and Mark stated, they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.
Colin has since held back, despite the fact that he is a former AFL club board member, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutyce and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only replied by text message, stating that given the fact that the dispute is being settled before the court, I have nothing to add.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the whole matter to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a statement to the court, Colin stated that he was trying to adjust to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation, made himself heard, and added that he always hopes for a successful solution".
On Friday, all hope was lost.
"Our dispute will be resolved in court soon", Colin wrote.
The weather in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers are pumping water and summer clothes.
At the Prague 4 kindergarten, where about 35 children are currently attending, they go out only in the morning.
The school is undergoing reconstruction and the trees planted are not yet providing much shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers are taking a shower in the fog room.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and curtains are drawn.
They're trying to cool the air with clean air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard for teachers and cooks too.
"The temperature inside and outside is above the hygienic limits for primary schools, so we should not even have open operations during this period", said school director Miloslav Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in the nursery, where she says the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We'll blow out after 6:00 in the morning, close the windows, and have a protective case on the south side.
"But it won't help much", she added.
They have better conditions at the forest nursery on the hostage farm, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have trees growing on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut, a table underneath it, and we do things there", said kindergarten principal Barbara Kompan.
Teachers and children are trying to walk into the woods where it's colder.
Kids have wet hats and water games on the program.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children", said Kompan.
Also, the head of the nursery in Novoborská Street on Prague's Prosek Jitka Vilímovská said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and dripping them with water.
"We have a fairly tall garden, so they're under the trees", she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child needs a head covering.
Teachers also remind children to drink.
They can choose, for example, little-sweetened tea or diluted juice and have a water drink in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad for their daily meal and fresh fruits and vegetables for their snack, which sometimes comes with their parents.
"Maybe today a mom brought a 10-pound baby melon", Makovicko added.
Drivers get water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport undertaking DPP provides them with water, ionised beverages or summer equidistants on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are mostly air conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to the cabin, some trams are also air conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged.
There was minor damage to the loop in the Host.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have sufficient drinking water.
'Cool drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and parking lots,' said the Greek Ministry of Transport.
In the car stations and in some alternate places, workers have so-called sodobars, which produce refrigerated soda.
Drivers are also given soluble ionic drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers on their daily shifts", the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic killed 108 of them, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic rose above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were primarily engaged in fighting fires.
"Fires in the natural environment and those associated with harvest work are predominant", said fire spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the evening weather changes, when the heat of the storm and the tidal rain in a number of places, did not bring relief to the firefighters.
In the storm, the fire department has been working on 236 operations.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"The most significant intervention was in the Central Czech Republic", Zaoral continues.
But firefighters were also needed in Stvolínka, Czechoslovakia, where 60 children's camp residents were evacuated to safety.
Tropical temperatures have also given Prague's rescue workers a job.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances arrived to pick up a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the carcass.
People should have their water heaters checked, the rescue workers warn.
Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released when imperfectly burned.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and a feeling of fainting.
If poisoning is suspected, the infected room must be evacuated.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Many tried before him and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to curb the flow of information from President Trump - including news reports - in the hope of keeping Trump on top of the agenda.
Here's a piece of the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with his staff on his first day in office, he highlighted a key problem Trump's White House is trying to fix: the misinformation that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that he would have to personally approve all information - whether on paper or spoken word - because the president could make better decisions based on the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but many of his predecessors have been tearing Trump's teeth and his media coverage.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades -- and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by the honorable reports, it was appropriate to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media outlets that were easier to convince", Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that the key to keeping Trump's tweets on the line - at least according to six former campaign organizers - is to ensure Trump regularly monitors media that praise him.
- I'm going to go.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter was ever under control is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something that others don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn't check them.
We'll probably never know about tweets Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him on the loose at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from raising controversial topics regularly.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to reinforce their agenda by pushing Trump's materials - which may, but may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the willingness of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
Here's an example of this from reporter Shane Goldmacher's pen:
Trump's current and former officials say that the president often reacts with great anger to negative media reports, especially leaked reports, and seeks to find their origin.
This happened in late February when someone handed the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - a website of Charles C. Johnson's provocateur - accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the source of many White House leaks.
Regardless of whether Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter for harassment; or whether he did not substantiate his claims with any evidence; or whether he had previously published false accusations and later dropped them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter were trying to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump would receive.
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to implement the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness won't go away and his aides will still compete for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission are certainly making it harder.
Tourists negotiating a drill and return to the "Millionaire Quarter"
Some of the most affluent homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again facing off against determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to reclaim land for their homes.
Tourists have parked 20 caravans in a field on a thriving street in the town of Solihull, which is nicknamed the 'Millionaire Quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being expelled in May, not to mention the pit that was dug on the spot by order of the authorities to prevent their intrusion.
The task force found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with a caravan unprotected gap that served as a way forward.
Angry neighbors attacked the Solihull City Council saying they were "incapable of solving the problem".
One resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: "They occupied the site on Monday evening after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they were throwing stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists have been moved to another place and now they're back.
There were more last night, and there are probably more today.'
She added: The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this problem.
I live in Streetsbrook and I'm not allowed to continue paying taxes until the board deals with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said, "It's ridiculous. We just watched the last tourist leave and they're back.
And this time there are more and this time they brought horses with them.'
A press spokesman for Solihull City Council said: "We are aware of the illegal occupation of a property near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with local police we are taking the necessary legal steps to successfully address the whole problem.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible report any unsocial or illegal behavior to the police on number 101.
We'll get the overall picture that we're going to take to court.'
The husband of a MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special transported the wounded Robert Zhitnyanskyi to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was on board the plane under constant supervision of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
Robert Zhitnyanskyi was reportedly in a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After transportation to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians reinforce the fight against rescue ships
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships that are arriving on the Italian coast with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
"Unless the NGO signs the new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations", Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a German rescue group Jugend Rettet's boat on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization declined to comment on the case, citing allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosios.
"Saving lives is and always will be our number one priority, and we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the rescue zones", the organisation said in a statement on social media.
We can comment on all the current charges only after we have gathered all the information and assessed the situation.
Italian authorities have been tracking the youth retreat's Iuventa ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants aboard the ship, handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the prosecutor's file, reportedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The ship's crew is suspected of violating the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The code of conduct stipulates the presence of an Italian police officer on board a ship, such as Iuventa, to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last-named organisation said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not constitute any 'substantial change or obstacle' to rescue operations.
For example, the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has refused to adopt the new code of conduct.
Meanwhile, Minniti was told that the sharp decline in immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen Libya's coast guard and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks this month with the Libyan mayor on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
She's got silicone and cellulite coming out of her overal!
The hot summer days are a temptation to wear only the most necessary to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominique Mesarroche does the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone involved with TV Prima just froze, they covered their bodies in a mini-overal.
And all she needed was a few normal moves and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
He checked how many times he cut it in half, and he also checked it so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly didn't need the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages inciting Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to more than two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
20-year-old Michelle Carter is serving 15 months of a two-year prison sentence followed by five years of supervised release.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told the court Thursday, "The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend.
Carter was left on parole until a decision was made.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood on the spot announcing the verdict with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped and her eyes facing the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the judge.
She ended his life to make herself feel better.
She was unable to accept her own responsibility, she said.
She didn't have any regrets.
But Carter's attorney said it was an unfortunate circumstance he deeply regretted.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that her age or maturity level or even mental disorder had no significant impact on her behavior.
The plaintiff read Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement: "She won't run away from me for a day so I don't grieve the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sister and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever, it was written in the statement.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was stalking her knowing that she would never attend his brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
"Losing the man I've known since birth is a pain I'll carry with me for life", she said.
The state of Massachusetts has no law that would affect a person who assisted another person's suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014 poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case caught the attention of the nation after Carter's text messages were published that incited suicide.
"Maybe hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care", it said in the text messages Carter sent just two weeks before he died while Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote to him, "You have to do it, Conrad, and you just have to turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charges were dropped.
Ms. Knox (30) made a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison".
Audi will repair up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi, the BMW car manufacturer, announced that it would offer its customers software updates for more than 350 000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that there are "more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would repair three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European carmakers have promoted the use of diesel cars to a large extent in Europe and the United States to comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of installing diesel engine gas neutralisation equipment on the road is increasing, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German automakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of defrauding powerful carmakers and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistake of Volkswagen, which, in an attempt to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced emissions during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the engine development department at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore does not qualify for extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined the German police criminal investigation into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system designed to circumvent European emission limits - expanding the accusations Audi faces in the US.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane has landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica region, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias that the plane was flying over people who were tanning on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled to the sea from danger.
Two people unfortunately failed to escape from the machine.
Local media reported a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach.
"The plane crashed and they were dead on the spot", said Pedro Coelho Dias, the local police chief.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board, both of them were rescued alive from the crash, and the police took them for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a freeway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unattached, even though it started to be built back in 1978.
Even if it's not fixed, it's always being fixed.
And it can't be built even with a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the D11 castle highway.
The Children of Earth movement has halted construction of another section of the park for at least a few months.
We Eastmen get the highway torn apart like a slashing of the slate.
They hide the wheel, and then it's only clear when and if we get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to cut down on the driving time and get trucks to and from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless flows of trucks go straight through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not as reasonable as a round.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was commissioned in 2008, which is an incredible nine years ago.
Not a single one since.
So when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section of the King's Castle and other sections of Jaromera were recently under construction, and archaeological excavations were underway, with construction to begin later this year, you could hear loud spots in eastern Czechia.
No one believed it anymore.
It turned out last week that we're not building this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Land-Club for Sustainable Transport of Brno has broken down.
Earth children repeat their tactics from D1.
They attacked the building permit decision in its entirety.
They also request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrates' Court, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the DRA.
So far, we're coming down from the D11 near a village with the excuse name "The Pumpkin".
So we get off, we just drive down the highway, and then we suddenly stand on the side road, and we prefer to get in a row.
The worst part is, you're seeing stories like this all over the republic.
A creepy, constantly clogged road to Beneshov, D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own little Push.
What do the Earth Children want?
What is the nature of the problems of communication construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the existing system of highways virtually unfinished?
Read in the new Reflection.
The Provence Levant is threatened by climate change
The lavender became a symbol of Provence in the south-east of France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Levandul is shrinking due to dry weather and harmful insects, causing panic on the faces of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: The cultivation of lavender in Provence is threatened because in the last few years the plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
Also responsible for this are the cicadas and the microbacterial-carrying lobsters that thrive in dry climates.
There's a lot at stake.
The lavender attracts tourists, and the oil produced from it is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of long, beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped, often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is of course less.
A solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and slow down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray a protective mixture of lime and water and to breed more dry weather resistant species.
The murder of a journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
The staff of Riodoce Weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news of the unrest in the Sinaloa area involving organized criminals, corrupt officials and the ongoing drug wars.
But today, under the influence of recent events, he is meeting mainly for his own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was hit by a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to name every word - no proof is needed, just imagination and guessing.
To choose from - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a list of criminals whose job it is to cover up crime.
Violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists among them are on the rise: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the journal Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books about drug-related violence.
His loss is noticeable, though his presence is pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" shown by the middleman hanging in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - in their 30s, wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Valdez with a smile on his face, nose glasses and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, and journalists talk about each other's trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with cases of journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists has so far indicted two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, so journalists' killers are brought to justice very exceptionally.
Riodoca's journalists insist on reporting on the violence taking place in Sinaloa; even though the destruction is sad and the territory is now very treacherous.
Without information on the murders and a sense of justice, a security meeting is meaningless, says Ibarra.
It's crazy to waste time on meetings like this, he adds.
"Unless we get more information, no one can be trusted".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Rio de Janeiro in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and shot him to death with 12 rounds, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the 12th River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed it near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
It seems rumors are spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is suspicious silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions try to fill the void.
Several people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with lavish two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "fair" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with expensive ports and important routes that transport drugs to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, still complains that he did not protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was a February interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that were waging war with Joaquin Guzmán's sons.
The peace might have angered the sons; the suspected gang members had bought all the newspaper copies as soon as they landed on the stand.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing other newspapers that had printed the same story.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as a milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals and journalists.
He survived so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
He was a practically veteran of Noroeste when he decided to sell his shares for $50 in 2003 and found Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloe, it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade, Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoce gained a reputation for courageous and truthful reporting; newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists were eager to explore problematic topics and publish uncensored texts - readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life", he said at the award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in the Sinaloae is a way of life, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
You have to play the role of a journalist or you have to play the fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of Riodoca miss Valdez, a man known for his wit and his unyielding language, a good friend who loved to give advice and hugs, a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the office and sit at the same table.
Now he asks, is this routine to blame for his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
They don't like you messing with their wives, their kids, their clean shops, their secret landing sites.
"These things were forbidden", Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like something's wrong, hands off.
The problem is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, that "the sense is the sense that can be fooled... and then came the Javier thing".
He says the old rules, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as do the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and others, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is changing all the time.
No cell phones are allowed in the Riodoca staff meeting room, as a few days ago, a spyware was discovered that the government had purchased to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Two police officers are outside the building, relieved by the 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, which are located in a four-story building in the Culiacan neighborhood.
Reporters are wondering if these same cops are not among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials the government says are corrupt.
It's been months since the last time journalists went to the mountainous areas that are basically controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They're also charging for suspicious government spending that took place in the governor's hometown.
There have also been several recent kidnappings at one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the DA's office.
No one has officially disclosed the identity of the people or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were careful to write about what every citizen of the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for almost the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including the incident in which one of Joaquín Chapo Guzmán's sons escaped from the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information on the kidnapping.
"Valdez would certainly have broken the case", said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
Now all the informants turned their backs on us.
Valdez's office has become a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, employees certainly did not expect to become press activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went to demonstrate in front of the state's attorney's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adams disappeared just three days after the Valdez murder in the western part of Michoacán State.
Only the burned body was found, and the authorities say that DNA analysis is the culprit.
The activity of journalists is escalating across the country, many of them organizing protests and stamping on the sidewalks and buildings of the Press Office.
The editor of the Bojorquez newspaper is on a day trip to Washington, where he is seeking international support and justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, held the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused authorities of monitoring journalists and killing them for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she requested a transfer to another department, fearing that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are plagued by organized crime, corrupt officials and indifferent public opinion.
In his latest book Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 has blamed more than half of all attacks on journalists on police officers and public officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you", Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which took place six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages".
Next to the severed heads were a keyboard and a headset.
Some branches have decided to shut down, such as the newspaper El Norte, based on the northern border of Chihuahua state, in response to the March murder of reporter Miroslava Breach.
The others are still going on, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with an article on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or even crossed the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is as difficult as getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being persecuted.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, like Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist", he said.
It's midnight on a Friday and the staff of Riodoce are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office -- the latest edition is sent to the printer -- drinking beer when the phone suddenly rings.
They learn that 19 people died in a gun battle between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area by the union members promised.
The news is being published on Riodoca's website from their mobile phone.
It doesn't run a day, and the opening title changes again.
The sound of the police sirens points to another shooting.
Bojorquez takes a soft look at the police patrol to see if they're watching.
If they're afraid, they don't say anything.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose medium is an excuse slogan for the whole Sinaloe - all the employees of Riodoca follow in his footsteps.
"How could we even think of leaving", said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, scary as it is.
Now researchers have uncovered the first finds of a remarkable creature the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - what experts have called the "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs" - have been found by a Canadian miner.
The remains have been preserved to such a high degree that experts have been able to pinpoint the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and have stated that the dinosaur had a "problematic past".
An article in Current Biology stated that it is 'the most well-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.'
The fossil is a new species in the family Nodosauridae, a dinosaur that lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described it as 'truly remarkable'.
According to National Geographic, the grass-fed white-collared tree is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada, is behind the discovery.
He came across something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kilograms.
Once the work is done, the dinosaur is ready to be uncovered.
"You just have to close your eyes a little and believe that he's asleep", said Caleb Brown, director of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
"It will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and most highly cultured dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa dinosaurs".
By studying its skin, researchers found that the herbivore - although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used the masking system that many animals use today.
Experts say it allowed him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspapers in May.
The researchers named it the Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team diligently excavating the fossil.
Thanks to the remarkably preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shapes of the shells and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a method of masking commonly used by modern animals in defense - the top of the animal was darker than the bottom.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising, since the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that the dinosaur was such a predator that evolution gave it the advantage of masking before confronting it.
Many modern masked animals - for example, deer, zebras, and or belts - are much smaller and also more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
"The presentation of a huge and heavily armoured dinosaur clearly illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the Cretaceous period", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the shells also revealed that dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown.
Researchers are continuing to study the animal and searching for further information about its life, including the preserved stomach contents, to track its last food.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea where it sank to the bottom.
The climate in Alberta was similar to that of present-day Florida, and rivers and oceans dragged farther inland than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and is preserved in three dimensions, so we can see its original size", Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did in the days of the crane.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to blink your eyes a little and it looks like it's just sleeping.'
During the Cretaceous period, huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, walked the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been the favorite prey of his equally formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 115-meter-long monster weighing over six tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after being mummified in the mud.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada, is behind the discovery.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including its skin and armor, which is complete from the hips to the hips.
The animal was 5 metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two 50-centimeter stems came out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that emptied it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, finding an individual saved in this way is like winning a lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
His right front leg is on his side with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist find the answer to the question, 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a St. Louis native sat in a bed in an Airbnb room and looked through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
Police just shot an 18-year-old man whose body was still lying in the street.
She argued that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah kept tweeting her posts on the wall.
The St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying uncontrollably on the street, where no one took him out for four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down the phone to come back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She was watching photos of police tapes and screaming people, and one of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and held a sign in his hand that said, "The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a clue and a barking dog on the other end.
In another video, another officer, she said, held a gun aimed at the crowd and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals".
"That's not normal", Ferrell said to herself.
This is not the kind of murder we're used to and can call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
I was angry and I cried.
She booked a return flight immediately and left for home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is told in the new documentary Whose Streets? which will be released in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and inflexibility told from the perspective of people living in the community who take to the streets and ask for answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell began a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower shirt and the same flower headscarf - about a topic they had discussed many times before - the experience of black people.
"Remember when I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?"
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old young man, and that's not right".
"It never occurred to me not to take her with me", Ferrell later said.
Today's events are the culmination of... events that have occurred in the past.
She had to know and see it for herself and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but also to know the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions where she does not experience racism on her own, she is no different from any other black child-women.
I feel like if I could protect her from this experience, I would only hurt her.
After arriving in Ferguson, South Florissant Road was the first stop in front of the police department, which became a base for activists who were waiting for police officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
It was here that Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for the others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped spread it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new kind of activism was slowly beginning to emerge.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9", Ferrell said, adding that while attending the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and worked to introduce health care and food to black communities.
I had no experience with organizing.
It was natural.
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and his cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document the events that were taking place.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story to use?"
This kind of skepticism has penetrated the community through a lot of people, often white people, who wanted to make a living from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked and we wanted to change that".
Folayan has already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, a well-known local artist who deals with the subject of death row inmates.
His involvement in the project also intrigued Ferrell and six other locals who were being watched by the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement", Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people would be represented - because that's how I would be represented".
While the documentary's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - to show that the movement was not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community together, Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to participating in the filming.
The documentary Whose Streets? describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, like how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked", Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking of the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
But I realized that to do this job and polish black people, I had to open up.
Ferrell's story also highlights the role of the elite black woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created a social media campaign under the name #BlackLivesMatter in response to the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin - call themselves freaks.
"Black women in leadership positions ultimately stand for the movement", said Ferrell, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black women of color have to bear the weight of these events.
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of prominent black women.
However, he insists that this is not merely an affirmative matter and that Ferrell is not the main character of the document because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the source of energy", she said.
That she was in the front lines is no coincidence, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy flood in front of the screen.
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of the television stations have cleared their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half year sentence for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home as "Changes".
Yet she has not stopped her efforts since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose are our chains.
There was a field burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters arrived, and a helicopter was also helping.
Near Český Brod in Kolínsk, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 3:15 p.m. and firefighters have declared a third-degree fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighter spokesman Ladislav Holomčić, the fire from the air helped extinguish the helicopter.
At 6:00 p.m., the firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, causing 700,000 crowns of damage.
Dozens of firefighters, both professional and volunteer, were fighting the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine compartment of the combine.
Hasit was also helped by a helicopter that carried out six water shots in total.
"We have handed over the site to the owner, until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. it will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade", Holomčić said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: artist creating portraits using DNA from Chelsea Manning
In the center of one of the rooms at the Fridman Gallery in New York City are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black, and gray - hanging from the ceiling on the wires, each of them as if falling out of sight of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from lipstick and hair that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cable to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborough, who combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before he left the presidency.
By using Manning's DNA algorithm and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a human with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a brilliant, if not intellectual commentary on the subjectivity of DNA - as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted - and the indissoluble determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken out about being considered a woman since she was young.
All of her photographs were confiscated by prison staff, and only one black and white photograph of her in a lower-quality has been leaked to the public, showing Manning, apparently concerned, sitting in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde pair, to which she is now associated.
In 2015, they were still getting a positive response to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012's Stranger Visions.
In this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette lighters and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And it was around this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were interviewing Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait", Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photographs were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she was interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic strip called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
President Obama actually requested Manning's release days after the comic was published, a welcome change after several unbearable years in a Kansas military prison.
It's interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war against people who are seeking to spread government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite hatred in areas he should be promoting through his tweets.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that everything is happening for a reason.
By making a statement to an artist on one of the gallery's walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter i in her name is punctuated with a heart) the end of autocratic factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
On the opposite side is a sequence of her mitochondrial DNA - a hundred-foot letter C, G, and A written with a pencil.
By using 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"I hope people will learn that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way", Dewey-Hagborg said.
DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the single page of the graphic novel above.
It shows Manning climbing King Kong Road from the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
Once they stop you from speaking, they win, it says.
Never be silenced.
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters", the Philadelphia artist said.
When I think about it, my skin is so gnarly.
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition in person, as predicted in the comic book, but when she does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic patterns, sorted as a protestant crowd.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm tall statue of Manning, which is a pencil with her genetic haploscopes.
"In the past, they were placed on walls, but this time I wanted them to make people feel like they were", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
I wanted to create the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates her.
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee wanted for murder.
A nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
A warrant was issued Monday for first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lath, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea, the Cook County coroner's office said.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body was found on July 27.
Police were notified by telephone of the incident, and upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a murder, police said, while investigating the two suspects.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to the university campus.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them", Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial manager at Oxford University.
A University and Somerville College spokesman said in an email statement: "We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the American police as well".
The statement also says that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole reality and wish he would report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's public relations director, said he's urging the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have information on their whereabouts and the search for suspects is intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmo, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment number 1008.
Police described the entire scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim", Guglielmo said.
Grand Plaza's management issued a statement to all residents: Police are now working on a timeline and profile of the victims and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.
In the near future we will complete the WADA plan  - Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Government Mutko
Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
 Part of the criteria for the new plan have now been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the planning and testing rights in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated, Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA Code Compliance Plan - which sets out the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the code contains nothing that Russia should be concerned about.
All has been announced and all will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, he added.
One of the criteria, however, calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, on the alleged government sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes.
Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot accept something that never existed.
Mutk's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian media outlet RSport Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message completely unconditionally, Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of imposing doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was on the right track to re-establish its mandate.
Police have charged three people, one of whom is a minor.
Police have charged three men with setting fire to a rare wooden church in Trinity Gutes on Frydek-Misteck.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a general threat offense.
This was reported to reporters today by the Moravian-Silesian police chief, Tomáš Kužel.
He said it was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very recent matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole thing", said Kužel.
He said the police would be negotiating a possible arrest of the accused.
No further information is available, according to the Director.
"I can't say more yet because the real work on the case is the criminal police and investigation services and the prosecutor who oversees the case", Kužel said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Gutech dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Preliminary estimates of the damage are in the tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was rebuilt.
The majority of the costs should be covered by the insurance, the additional costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also prepared and the contribution is counted on by the owner of the monument, the local parish.
A similar 16th-century wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Hraby was destroyed by fire 15 years ago.
It was a power failure that caused it.
A precise copy was made in his place.
The state counts on the citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
The objective of the Act on the Preparedness of Citizens for State Defence is to provide financial support for associations used in defence of the State, to volunteer fire training or to a team of trainers.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been given the task of processing it by the government, promises it will improve the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which they may then be able to use in crisis situations.
It's a proposal the department has prepared.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on defense.
The main objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the people of the Czech Republic to defend the state, both outside the exercise of their duty of defence and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would financially or materially support radio amateurs, shooters or cynicalists' associations and enable their members to increase their skills.
In return, it would obtain data on people willing to come to the country in times of crisis if necessary, and their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors may also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It also includes organizing talks with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option is to set up a new office to manage and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and that the state should use their capabilities only after the state of emergency has been declared.
'The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats', it is stated in the intention, referring to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Minister officials noted that the focus should therefore be on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just those of the military.
'The basic objective of the intention is to create a very broad base which will enable every citizen to respond qualifiedly to situations threatening the sovereignty of the State or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself, if necessary to contribute to the protection of others, and not to impede the performance of tasks by the armed forces of the Czech Republic through misconduct,' the intention states.
The passage of the bill would bring considerable financial costs.
The Ministry says their height will depend on the variant chosen.
The Authority, for example, expects to finance projects to prepare citizens for state defence up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
The rest of the money would go to payroll or to build an information system.
The proposal also envisages the need to expand the scope of regional military commands, which would employ a total of 42 additional troops.
The Ministry's representatives have already stated that the law should also help to resolve some Czech politicians' disagreements with the introduction of the European Union's gun-holding directive.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons prohibited by the Directive.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but she couldn't find the right survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And while she promised anonymity to the survey, some employees expressed distrust throughout the process.
"I've been looking for consistency and objectivity", said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based e-commerce company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from the outside.
New HR startups are constantly emerging in the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By developing and licensing software with a specific purpose of measuring employee obligations, startups enable companies to conduct rapid voting, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass their superiors and contact direct managers.
"There are tools on the market like Food and Fitbit that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that in three years, she gained greater awareness of what her employees think and feel because of Glint.
In addition to quick surveys and team-specific voting, Glint offers a company temperature map and a general overview of the highest-complaint groups as well as a low-rating manager overview - allowing users to work on correction.
Companies are starting to realize the need to look at the workplace culture - in case they become another Uber - which is getting into scandal after a former employee posted a blog post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a technical and financial development website, the global control, regulation and compliance industry could be worth over $118.8 billion by 2020.
A Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandal.
Convercent's nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently took over the business.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable flash surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has authorised regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behaviour - and if regulators do not intervene - it can face costly consequences from a customer boycott, employee exhaustion or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of company policies and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check the company's phone number or email address, file a formal complaint, and hope for a successful solution.
Often, this was a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Deputy Director General Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it's ensuring rapid detection and resolution of problems that never before have been reached by managers sitting in offices miles away from a real resolution of complaints - for example, discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
It is close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience, said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
We also protect shareholders from employee litigation.
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following Enron's failure to abide by employee ethics, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until social media shed light on the whole thing that companies began to realize that in the online world, they couldn't just hide their skeletons in a closet.
"Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith", Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's being embraced by the bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent, as part of its February campaign, pulled out a total of $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and ultimately withdrew $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised $60 million over the course of the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of studies clearly confirms that today's workers expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are not the main advantages.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and to dedicate their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
"When people are happy at work, they feel their voices are heard and their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit when companies succeed and companies thrive when employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool comes on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's no wonder that there are a lot of investors to support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, there can be big changes.
And if change doesn't happen quickly - at worst - it can cause disappointment and disinterest in employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, consulting director at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies rely too heavily on data alone.
Because once you don't get things done, the employees start asking themselves, "Did they even hear me?"
They care about me?
And if not, why should I care?' "
Madison Reed, which now conducts a monthly staff survey, thanks to Glinth, can solve the problem in one day, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett managed to reorganize several teams within the company and begin communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important perspective on its employees and hopes to achieve high long-term employment in an industry known for its frequent layoffs.
If you do not strive to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you, added Vitrano.
And once you start losing employees, you're going to lose customers.
And with the influx of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt.
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with a record of 38.3 degrees Celsius at the Hodonínsk Observatory.
He overcame Tuesday, originally the hottest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But not many temperature records were set on Tuesday and Thursday.
The main part of Morava was hit by the wind, and the Czech Republic was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or evened at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measurement stations set a record on Thursday.
For example, in the Guard, today's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In the Břeclavsk freezer today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in the Brno Hills the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the Guardian, were from 2013.
High temperatures have been observed today, mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard, the hottest heat was recorded in Dyjakovic in Znojemsk and Brodě nad Dyjom in Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but the record was not broken.
In contrast, the Czech Republic's western and northwestern regions, according to the CHMÚ website, have had their current peak temperatures of only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there did not begin to rise until later this afternoon", meteorologists reported.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, and even more heavy rainfall could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, temperatures will remain high on Friday and in southeastern Moravia on Saturday.
We've had such a mess.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in elections as every adult in the country.
They want to make direct decisions, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penty owner Marek Dospiva, along with other watercolor colleagues Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejškov Realists.
Second Life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
The convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, has taken over the Party of the Privatized.
The political movement Agrofert, as Andreja Babiš' project was accidentally named by the mayor of Jarołosław Niemiec, is a chapter in itself.
Their billionaire was recently caught by the Elders.
His name is Dalibor Grandfather, the owner of the Jablotron security firm.
He says he's in politics to do good.
But the mayor's dressed entrance didn't do much for Dedeck.
"I never dreamed of small goals", he said at a press conference.
That means my goal is for the ANO movement, for the Mayor's movement to win 20 percent of the vote.
They all laughed.
But the man's remark is more characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong opinions.
Although she intends to run for the votes of the electorate in the mayor's dress, she continues to support Andrey Babiš.
Grandpa supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Grandma is not a sharp speaker and does not rule by the pleasant rhetoric of political snakes", he wrote of him before the 2013 election.
But he definitely doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
I'm going to keep Grandma a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, which he's in control of, and do something for all of us.
Soon after the Stewards introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Grandma again.
And he said he wanted the Stewards to learn to imagine possible cooperation with Grandma.
Some may appreciate that Grandfather does not change his mind and stands up for himself no matter what shirt he wears.
Others may speculate that Grandma is sending someone so unmotivated to the Elders to build her own barn.
Others may ask whether Jablotron's boss, for example, has not gotten into a business dispute with Agrofertu's boss and is looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Dedeck's first public performance wasn't just about Grandma.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, a similar statement would have been hard to resist.
By the way, the court-appointed crook Zdeněk Bakala, before the 2010 election, threw millions at all parties.
The political division of the security agency, Vita Barta, TOP 09 and the Citizen Democrats, combined this time, are almost 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
Since Grandpa's in politics, he could have at least studied the rules of the game.
Maybe he shouldn't have asked why the politician has such a bad reputation.
In his early days in politics, Grandfather was crowned with a proposal for tax breaks for families with educated children.
People with college degrees come to us about 50,000 a month.
I'm under 20.
A man of fifty thousand is rich for the country.
The poor guy with 20.
The poor pay taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state in which they do not participate too much.
The rich simply need help to keep poverty from falling into poverty.
The parents can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Grandma can join hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Dedeck, can confirm that billionaires aren't good people.
And then there's the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not regard members of their party or nationals or nationals of the State as their employees or the country as their property.
And finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex must have been reduced by 234 million.
Selling real estate isn't always easy.
And often, he doesn't get 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the US President Donald Trump is selling the property.
When the Le Chateau des Palmiers estate was sold, the price dropped by an incredible £8 million.
He reported it to Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump".
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's connection to the US president didn't protect the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean headquarters by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, but the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even at a discount, the villa complex is about the same as the average 76 apartments in the centre of Prague.
And that's no wonder.
The impressive 5-acre property on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-service bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym, and other facilities.
It's made up of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and tennis courts.
There are dozens of palms planted on the property.
There's a beautiful view of the sea from the terrace.
According to real estate experts, the price reflects the fact that connecting with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the average property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation is that he paid about £15 million.
He was supposed to buy the property for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new price, he's second.
Property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two practice sessions a day.
It's almost 11:00 a.m. and UCLA football players are catching up on the sidelines of the new school field.
Some of them take off their shirts and reveal their sweaty backs, a clear sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, those few minutes of inactivity are a half-day break.
Summer semester players will go to their classrooms after a three-hour training session to study for final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for the meeting at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"These guys are gonna be a real bum for the next three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's move to Tuesday.
By cutting two practice sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, it makes training days even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That's why the first three UCLA workshops are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to fit into the already busy diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons as coach at Westwood, the Bruins' training camp begins a week earlier than last year, and training is limited for the summer semester.
A total of 18 practice sessions are scheduled for August 20, with formal preparations for the first game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora was reportedly supporting the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to the already busy player diary.
"Three or four days are a lot of stress for the players and it's very exhausting for them", Mora said.
But nobody gave up, everyone's trying.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will settle down.
UCLA will be closed after training camp, which won't be easy given the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury Luskin Center hotel that the players have occupied after harvesting the safety net behind the gate bar.
The Bruins should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that when rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by security", added Mora.
Security is being taken care of, but it's not uncommon for someone to rent a room and record our training.
It's a good trade.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will the parking lot No. 8.
We'll make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will be fine.
It's all planned.
Facebook plans to tighten the scrutiny of facts to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake news to third parties to check and display findings under original posts in an effort to fight so-called "fake news", the largest social network said Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoax, which it will send to third parties to verify and potentially display the survey results under the original contributions.
Facebook has been labeled as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's US presidential election.
There is a political debate on the whole of Europe, with French voters flooded with fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany planning to impose a penalty on the social media network ahead of the September election if it does not remove angry posts quickly.
Facebook said in a separate statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it was planning to launch testing of a new fake news control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In addition to showing third-party verified messages, people are asking for more content to be more informed and to make the right decisions about what they can share, Sara Su, Facebook's product news manager, wrote on her blog.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the 'related articles' feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
Little Scotney Castle recently played the lead role in the music video for the band Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher took refuge there during the 1970s and 1980s.
But from his cozy spot on the Bewl River in Kent, England, Scotney witnessed 700 years of stormy history that inspired the crippled Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"The look on the writing of a man who died 300 years ago fascinates me", says Rhodes with a serious face.
When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.
A Castle in England, a graphic novel, documents the lives of families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each story illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library inspired documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
I was struck by a thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites, he said.
It's his fingerprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love the archives!
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of spending almost four months at the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian New Castle, browsing the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyenas on the wall and bottles that were thrown down for centuries in a ditch.
He walked the plot and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the landlords, gardeners, and sometimes also to artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
He drank whiskey and wrote at night.
The history of the Scotney confidentiality is relatively largely unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until 2006 following the death of the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were just beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words like the words of the aristocrats of many centuries, throwing their hands at the words:
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing property: "You may think the land dispute is boring", Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a bribe.
Let go of it!
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a bridge and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a castle riot in 1380, which was in a book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex", Rhodes said.
The English revolt actually started in this area, and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected eventually.
Other stories are strongly connected to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest whose family hid Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell who allegedly staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was discovered).
The Rhodes family's favorite are the Darrells: "I was fascinated by the male generation - men of that time were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have dealt with this by marrying wealthy or old maidens-- I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who would like to brace their heirs.
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former early 20th-century sanatorium that was swallowed up by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
I was sad when I left, he said.
I was like, 'Now I'm going back to the real world.'
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media has published President Donald Trump's words about the new US immigration plan, which also includes a change in green card issuance.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to decline by 50,000 each year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
New rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will be introduced to Congress soon.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars by changing the rules for issuing green cards to people in other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will give preference to English-speaking applicants who are well-funded and will demonstrate skills that will benefit our country", Trump said, citing media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on our guard
Just when it seemed like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots popped up on the Internet.
- I did.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement about the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to former Sheffield University professor of robotics and artificial intelligence and co-founder of the FRR, Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be taken seriously.
Customers can choose eye color, mustache shape and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are getting tired of them, but sales are growing and we have to be prepared to see them more and more", Sharkey said on the occasion of the news release.
Modern sex aids are changing from inflatable masks to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can customize the robot to his image - from the color of his eyes and the shape of his nipples to the appearance and color of his nails.
What's very disturbing, though, is the fact that many robots have their own personality, which would embarrass Miss Stepford.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone leather.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set up a variety of character traits for his replacement wife, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the cold Farrah, who is shy and wild Wendy, who is adventurous.
The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality to the fullest extent possible, says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even in the mood, like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or in a mood.
The rise of sex robots is alarming for a number of reasons - not the confusion about real human relationships, but rather the inferiority of female characteristics and violent tendencies - such as the frigid (or defiant) Farrah.
True Companion on its website likened Roxxxy to a male vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?"
But sex robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their origin and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift away from ideal or sexual equality toward the desire for seductive sex with an optional bias.
Most men, of course, won't buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringe of the public's interest.
But this marginal interest can become a mirror of the present-day.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they're given a free market excuse.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights and a president is sitting in the White House, often speaking very slanderously to women.
The most terrifying aspect of the Servant's Tale is not what we see - hanging bodies and twitching eyes, but rather the reality of those visions.
The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but it seems like a small step at the moment.
Sex robots should be as much like real women as possible (although with the dimensions of porn actresses).
Their makers construct them to be pleasant to the touch and to act at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their personality, a robot can't replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work, no history, nothing that would encourage their independence or disrupt their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
It says 21st century: servants.
NBA star on the green.
Curry's fighting for the cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a blowout at the opening game, did not lose among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner played in the Ellie Mae Classic Web.com Tour lower-season tournament in Hayward, California, first round with 74 strikeouts and will be fighting for a cut.
The Golden State star, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started off very nervous and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even after that, he wasn't as accurate between the holes as under a basketball basket, yet he left a dozen pros behind with a four-point lead.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first pitch, but then it got a little bit saddled", Curry said, with a huge crush on him.
It was very nervous to blow the first shot of the tournament, but it was all I ever hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away", he added.
If Curry manages to fight a cut that will most likely be set two shots below the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the fear, I think I can", said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed amateur and professional competitions in the past.
Hayward is starting his first PGA Tour event.
He was granted a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, disrupt entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, American newspapers were full of advice on how to consult with relatives who elect Trump.
I'm told we're just waiting for the nerve to let us.
Less attention is paid to Trump's ability to blackmail the family.
I'm talking about this because this week I was visited in New York by my cousin, a poet and leftist fan who lives in Chicago and who has long been a Republican idiot in our family.
She reminded me that being sad in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family -- including all the Republican siblings she's been fighting about politics with for years -- is on the same wave.
Dining at the family table is a good thing; but I'm surprised that in the wider context, it's a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative impact of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're referring to the dreaded possibility that his jokers might one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more terrible long-term scenario where Trump is normalizing right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these days, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior -- dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) -- both of which, compared to Trump, seem like very mild offenses.
After Trump leaves, it'll be enough to make the next Republican candidate at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest roller coaster run by the New York City Department of Parks -- you can't get a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center of the wheel is covered with glass - clowns and animals film and stare at their shoulders in horror - a completely cloudy view and cinematic music surprisingly reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon fade away: the view from tall buildings, the panorama, instead of breathing in the atmosphere, and the reality of the city, not getting to your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still don't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese -- not counting the theme bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage -- but London Underground stations.
However, the Central Park roller coaster is a remarkably magical experience, to the point that it's great for two two-year-old children and two mature women to enjoy.
If I could evaluate the wheel, it would earn the maximum points, but fortunately, no one asks.
I had a similar experience this week in the store when I was asked to rate my credit card experience on a scale of one to five.
It's the same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, except I can put a 15% discount on the ratings for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to interfere in the favor of shoppers when it's not necessary.
The woman at the store smiled and apologized for reluctantly rating my credit card pass by five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for a wrist wound he said he caused himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original murder conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the bathroom closet door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If he succeeds, Pistorius faces a maximum sentence of 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a baby was born in captivity by a panda that burned in the wild.
The pandemic rescue program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the genome of captive pandas.
Chang Cheng, a senior official at the center, told the New China Agency that the pandemic is at high risk from a family crossing.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas were living in captivity.
Only two thousand survive in the wild.
Trying to pair captured pandas with wild ones is the first step in helping to protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the wildlife sanctuary at the beginning of the pandemic on March 11.
With a tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every step.
She met her chosen one, Chao-chao, 12 days later.
The sexual encounter with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
And that can be considered a small miracle, because the panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
The males are quite uncertain about when the female is ready, and they are often confused and uncertain about what to do.
The young girl was born healthy, and, despite her extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, Chao-chao weighed 216 grams at birth.
The average newborn panda weighs 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, bTV quoted the statement as saying.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained in the early hours of August 1 by the Sithonian police.
All were released the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for camping and impose strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will run throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
She's tied for 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golf player Clara Spilková is ranked 50th after the first round of the British Open.
The Kingsbarns field in Scotland was outscored by one stroke below the pair when she played three birdies and two bogey.
The 22-year-old Czech player is hoping to make her first cut in the majors.
The $3.25 million grant was awarded to the top American star Michelle Wie, who won the first lap of the race by a field record 64 runs, eight pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Authority NVWA reported to Reuters that it is investigating 20 percent of all poultry farms in the Netherlands, which it says means 80 percent of eggs on the market are harmless.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only limited to the number of egg types recognisable by the specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have also taken steps to close the holdings, had not been allowed to enter the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, whose markets have been marked with problematic insecticides.
According to the veterinary authorities, eggs from Belgium were last placed on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May.
Chicken from Belgium was last seen in the Czech Republic in June.
But in the Czech Republic, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance used in the preparation of fleas, ticks and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss her, says the goalkeeper Cinderella, looking for a job.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll come back one day", smiled the 27-year-old Cattleman, who could start the season in a bad dress.
It depends on whether he gets hired by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like school, three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper ahead of me.
I've been learning.
I started catching the next year.
Before season three, I thought they'd give me more room.
But they brought in a new goalie, and I'm back on the line.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But in the first ten games, we only got five points, so the coaches started shooting.
My colleague got more in the end.
But that's the way it is.
They wanted to play him next season.
What was life like in Riza?
That's wonderful.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm going to miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're in our third year together, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How hard is KHL for goalkeepers?
The top 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slavs who have to change their style of play against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means more playing back, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is the Russians want to play the blank.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty gate in front of them, they're better at recording.
There's more shooting in the Czech Republic.
You had trouble traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually designed so you play four games outdoors and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians even see their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, and basketball is a national sport.
Everyone is in favor.
Although it didn't work, there were a lot of people coming.
Did Dinam's performance in the KHL help Latvia to almost make it to the quarterfinals of this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008, and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their World Cup results have started to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they fell to Canada in the quarterfinals, 1:2.
It was a remarkable result for them.
KHL has taken them to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts has been in the line and Ralfs Freibergs is in the contract.
How come so many people come here?
They're not any bad guys, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, including Latvians.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riza.
So we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have the budget for a goalie, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the finals, they chose someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'm gonna wait for something to come up.
You're not nervous about this?
That was four years ago when I left here and I didn't know what was coming.
The situation is not the best, on the other hand, I've been home for a while.
I caught something at KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question is, when and where do I sign?
How real is the possibility that you'll be flying the New Year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens next month, where it boils down.
Now I can only wait for the agent to decide.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn't the kind of season I could choose from.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government flight to Flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote an article on "Does a Good Housewife Care?" about the summer camp near Orlik.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I'll allow myself to recall the main passages of the article.
There's been talk of summer camp for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what this is, it's probably best to check out the official site of the Pietny Place Lete cultural monument.
There, in the introduction to the historical review, they learn that the camp was two kilometers east of the village of Leta, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a concentration camp, and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
Another text describes life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were placed in Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, the largest transportation to the extermination camp was carried by 370 people.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the enormous suffering of human beings caused by human beings and perverse ideologies.
There is no denying that these events need to be kept in mind.
There is no question that the memorial should be held at the site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970's, a pig house was built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was discovered by accident in 1992 by an American named Paul Polansky, and in 1995 a monument was unveiled in the summer.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and destroy the pigs, but so far, they haven't.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 it has been administered by the Monument of Lidice.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the plea.
So briefly, the fate of the camp.
It was not until the autumn of last year that the government approved the purchase of the pig and decided to have an expert assessment of the price drawn up.
The Minister of Agriculture says the government will buy the pigs afterwards.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably measure those intentions if I went public with them".
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
Some unofficial estimates put the price at hundreds of millions, others put it at a billion.
It's not going to be cheap anyway.
And just a few hundred meters from the former camp, a monument stands, which the state invested nearly 10 million crowns in 2010 to restore.
Even if the entire transaction were fined by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is obviously not a threat, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Isn't the government prioritizing anything else?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, stands by the will of history almost immediately in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place and anyone who wishes can bow down to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the piety place as carefully as possible.
The entrusted assets, including taxpayers' money, should be managed by the person responsible, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, under the care of a proper manager.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the finance minister and the deputy prime minister are not the whole government.
But I still see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement as an empty campaign proclamation.
I went to the site in May of this year to see it.
Very decent driveway, decorated parking, replicas of wooden camping huts.
One exposed, the other integrated, running water toilet.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own piety, made of stones placed on a slight slope.
Lots of flowers and crowns.
All attributes corresponding to the significance of this place, as it fits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, to conserve and make at least a part of the exposed foundations visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is the direction in which Minister for Culture Daniel Herman could turn his efforts.
If he manages to enforce the government's ransom of pigs with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare for your digestive system.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: A diet high in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually advised not to eat meat or dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found in the protein helps to build immune cells that support the gut's resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, who led the study, explained that immune cells protect the gut and help to remove harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In the study, the scientists found the presence of immune cells that promote the body's tolerance of specific bacteria in the stomach of mice.
To make cells, this bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - that is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body's tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells had.
He also suggested that if the same thing were to be found in humans, a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and tryptophan-rich foods would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
In a study of a certain type of immune cell that promotes body tolerance, postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas found that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group of the same mice raised separately lacked cells.
She concluded that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The gut of mice was tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
Mice that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome - so they didn't develop this type of immune cell - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and they developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octane acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent, and when the tryptophan doses were halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the tryptophan by-products of L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "We should all probably strive to develop these cells, because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase the cell population.
Jose Mourinho considers signing Nemanja Matić and his move to Manchester United 'genius'
Manchester United have gained a 'genius' in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the defender made his debut in a Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed for £40m, came on as a substitute in the first leg of a 2-1 win in Dublin - the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will face Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a defender alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić was in poor form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinh said was a matter of preparation before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has a genius mindset - he thinks like football", Mourinho said.
We'll help him get back in shape as soon as possible.
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his XI for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done a fantastic job and brought in three of the four most important players.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players", he added.
"Four out of four would be more pleasant, but I admit they did the best for me".
The life challenge of the chicken-skin king of the Peanut-Lord.
He wants a lesson from the Cup!
This multi-word picture was drawn by a new program on TV Prima Zdenkova Academy.
The rumor immediately gave him a chance.
"Dear Zden, I would like to apply to your cooking academy because, hand in hand, I think I can learn a lot from you", he urged him in a video on social media.
And since these two have been dating for years, the Lad never forgot to annoy him this time.
"In return, I can teach you to sweat from diet chicken, or pickles, or invite you to a water and show you why fried cheese is a favorite", said the grasshopper.
She's really serious about her participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move on to a higher level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says", said Lightning.
Pohlreich, however, did not comment, as he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
When Gruška attended the culinary academy, only Prima reacted by taking the whole thing as his personal activity, which goes off the air.
He hit Hruška Pohlreich with his first cook in December 2004.
In a few days, it sold over 300,000 copies!
The new program that Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the fall broadcast schedule is a non-fake cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his students from a number of audiences and introduces them to 12 cooking techniques in 12 works.
In the final episode of his show Now the Chef in November 2014, Zdenek had a cross-section of pear on the back of his shirt.
If he had my face in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just laughing at that pear - pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins", responded the lad.
He's got his own idea of the art of the boat.
"Cooking according to the Lorde of Peaches is not even considered at home, because I'm not going to let gastropunk go home", the boss says clearly.
I really appreciate the day of the potatoes, and he even says I make honey chicken.
But his recipes will definitely not show up on my show", Hrusk said.
He's such a jerk!
He's not a cook to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or a moron", Pohlreich said of Hrusk in one lecture.
"I don't have 20 to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore", said Hrušk, who was insulted.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house by waving
A British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip right in his body, able to unlock a door to his home and office with a simple wave of his hand, and even start a car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and is now offering the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
The procedure for implantation and follow-up is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam also offers a service to replace microprocessor-compatible door locks and cars.
A married father of one has integrated the technology into his home and into his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple wave of the hand.
The White House's supply has cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for the American manufacturing industry celebration last month came to $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME Weekly.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the President aboard, was the highlight of the July 17 White House program, which was a showcase of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials were watching a product show from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was built next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklifts from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the helicopter's presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn as part of an emergency, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the helicopter's management.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event", Commander HMX-1 wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy chief of air operations, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the show, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and remain in place until the entire area was fully cleared as planned between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The email also said that if there was a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight due to the working hours regulations.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening, along with the helicopter and a security unit.
From the records - obtained by TIME - it was not clear whether the second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was fine", the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked", the deputy commander wrote.
This "Made in America" show was designated by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political underpinnings.
During his time at the event, the president advocated for health care reform, which was passed by the Senate, and spoke of trying to keep the government order in place.
The use of air transport vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The president uses them for travel.
But their presence, purely for presentation reasons, is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane flew in the background at his first-ever campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida.
"The White House is pleased to see the 'Made in America' showcase products from all 50 states that make Americans from American materials", said press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and South Lawn and practice possible approaches with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 drill landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current crew training, a state official said.
The helicopter unit took off on the same day as part of the non-presidential support missions for another 11 hours.
The White House said no further props were paid from taxpayer money.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not in any way involved in the negotiations to deploy the helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and the exact costs related to the overview are difficult to determine according to the Navy's statement.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017 is $24 380 per flight hour for the VH-3D.
Unit records indicate a 30-minute time from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to estimate taxpayer costs on the basis of reimbursement estimates", Walters said of the whole case.
These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual costs.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission has not yet established the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated using helicopters for the show.
"The idea of the show this week is to introduce products made in the USA", Spicer said.
I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defense of our state and to provide employment to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of helicopters and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact deserves to be remembered.
It's unclear whether Trump was also looking at a helicopter while on his tour of South Lawn, but all we can say for sure is that he was behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the president, "I've got three of my own".
A young woman was trapped in a swamp by Lake Macha, and the police were crawling at her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday at about two o'clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the wet.
When she decided to ask for help from a police officer on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her", police spokeswoman Ivana Balak said.
A number of police patrols went to the location she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police had to be barbed in the rack of crab wetters hundreds of meters before they felt the solid ground under their feet again", Balák said.
And she was missing in the same way.
The police were oriented in the direction of her call for help.
"To avoid losing this connection, they agreed to count it out loud", said the spokeswoman.
Police found the woman at 3:45 a.m. in the swamps of Borny.
She was on the brink of physical and mental strength and showing signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called her to the Czechoslovak hospital.
The connection of the Uncle to the Stan?
A bride becomes a bride.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project searchameslusny.cz, it's as if a billionaire is telling voters that STAN is suffering from a decent people deficit.
And he also claimed that the politically unrelated party, rather than the less well-known mayors and independents, actually has no national agenda for the House elections.
Her candidate for the presidency is simply a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, regardless of his political views.
That's how the Bart party started, and it didn't go very well.
In addition, he has also denied that the grandfather is pursuing decent people and personalities who may be replaced by some mayors in the candidates' ranks, and he has also denied the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is the political checks and experience of the mayor, traditionally the most popular politicians, according to the polls.
Now they're quietly replacing the quickly-collected unknowns.
Total break with the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdik also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the people's candidates.
But if STAN was a little suspicious of identity back then, then when Grandpa comes, the identity game ends.
Not only did Gazdík long stand up against ANO Andreja Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, the grandfather, who publicly praises Babiš, stated: "My goal is for the ANO movement, the Starostová movement, to win 20 percent in the upcoming elections".
Let's hope you're not making a move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is no coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Grandma, but unlike Grandma, he doesn't have his own political brand.
STAN has been a reality show for some time now rather than a real political party, and Grandpa's helping hand is making the bride-to-be even more of a saleswoman.
For a while, STAN went with the TOP 09, then the people, and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police dogs trained in the Bridge by helicopter
Explosive search dogs and search dogs trained today at Lake Bridge by helicopter.
A police dog must not be fearful and afraid of flying, said the head of the Coast Police Cynologists, Petr Tomášek.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
At the bridge, both adult dogs trained and those just undergoing training were trained.
In addition to standard training to detect sharp explosive samples around the lake and search for a missing figurine, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter hits, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's path.
"Eight helicopters, the dog goes and immediately searches", said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or cannot start working immediately after a helicopter ride is disqualified from training.
"They are usually left in the garden by the dogs", Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs in the Bay Area with a variety of specialties.
German sheep are predominant, but Belgian sheep are also on the rise.
The dog breed has been taking care of him since the puppies.
"He's raising it himself, preparing it for the service the dog will do for us", Tomášek added.
The animals are subject to repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal any medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unassuming, he passes his first tests at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get into a sharp hit", Tomášek added.
The length of time you've been on the force depends on the health of your dog.
They usually serve eight to ten years.
They then live most of their lives in their dog cages.
Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the center of the Netflix hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has confirmed the third and fourth seasons - the first-named ones have already received the first trailer and the screenplay of other negative characters.
In season three, the DEA is focusing on the richest drug cartel in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential leaders, they operate like a Fortune 500 company, except for escalating violence and hiring more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian rights activists to fight drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos is set to premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of the society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are in local elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if women are included, as well as all related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled for April 5.
The Taliban have issued several threats against the electoral process, which is moving international combat to the second round.
In this year's election, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government is peacefully handing over its power to the next government.
Haysom said that a strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery is brewing beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the Lobcha near Msen brewery back to life a few years ago.
The brewery was first mentioned in 1586 and has a Renaissance core and was converted to a steam powered operation in the 19th century.
The boom years followed, when the brewery was known for its mostly dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II, production was halted and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served as the state's treasury.
The brewery's owners destroyed it after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and dismantled for building materials.
But in 2007, new hopes were lit up in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzovy.
They began repairing buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They have been careful and dedicated to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery is as much a shapeshifter than it was in the 19th century, when its golden age began.
Their work was recognised by the Ministry of Culture as a cultural monument and the building became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trail.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was solemnly restored.
To taste the great lobotomies in the picturesque countryside of Kokorin, visit the brewery grounds.
They use coconut water from protected landscapes, hops from lobotomies, and barley.
You'll taste the traditional light-lit lager, but also the dark beer and specials.
And don't miss a beer tour, which takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and 2:30 p.m.
The largest artillery fort in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique structure was to be Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Jacler, on top of a terrain ridge above the village of Babia.
It was originally to consist of up to 12 bunkers connected by a vast underground.
It was supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, materials, power plant, machinery and hospital.
But the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, a single massive concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were breached.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Company who began to rebuild the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also take a look here.
The underground is already 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry hull with exposures and underground, the site also includes an armed light fortification facility, two dismantled infantry hulls, trenches and the Trutnovsko Fortified Science Trail.
Refreshment, cozy terrace and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the port of Trajan near Rome, or the Assyrian palace at Nineveh and Nimrod.
The Choteshov Monastery, originally from the early 13th century, now forms a large four-wing convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately, is unique to the buildings that are in danger of collapse.
But the enthusiasts do not give up and are organizing a lot of activities to support the monastery.
One of them is the next year's dinner for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where Mr. Vladimir Mišik, Ivan Hlas, will perform, you will see the Sheremite performance and you will see the places of beautifully extended buildings that are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Land Museum in Brno invites you to take a unique excursion into the deepest ages of the Stone Age, into the world of our ancestors.
You will learn how Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with a variety of extreme climatic conditions, especially the alternation of the ice ages and the interglacials.
Despite their simple material culture, they were immensely successful predators of their time.
You'll also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy was like, their technological skills and their hunting minds, but also their aesthetic senses.
That you wouldn't tell the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.

Get to know the plant with one click.
Pl@ntNet is a free app for students and plant lovers alike.
If they're wondering what plant they just bumped into on the walk, this app will help them.
All they'll have to do is take a picture of the plant and the app will recognize the species itself.
The new app, available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools took part in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with the teachers in the application database.
The new French app is free to download from the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to get as many people as possible to contribute their images to the app, and thus increase the number of plants that the app can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or a mobile phone can now go into the forest", said project coordinator Ivana Poláčková.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photograph of a flower, leaf or fruit, the app can recognize the name of the plant in a matter of seconds, and then assign it to the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French have given us permission to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project "The Secret Life of the City".
It is therefore welcome that users contribute to the application after creating an account with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will assess whether it is useful and then add it to the database", Poláčková reported.
GMB's concerns regarding the investment in the McVitie's plant in Glasgow
The unions are requesting assurances from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's of a long-term commitment to the production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that the company was for the time being silent about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 people who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the entire area over the previous few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be among the first to be informed of changes in the plant's operation.
In a letter to the head of construction, the Scottish unions of GMB expressed their concern that McVitie's would not fulfil its promises to finance and modernise its production lines.
GMB Chief Organizer Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building manager regarding the company's needs and future investment plans in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workers are mostly from the local community and Glasgow area, where work in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the high unemployment and social exclusion sectors.
In terms of labour, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and slow production - the east of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving producer like McVitie's.
A Pladis spokeswoman said: Tollcross's head of construction received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross was held two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at that meeting.
We talked to employees that, as with all companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we assess our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: In recent years we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We value the heritage of Tollcross and the local sites and will inform employees and trade union representatives immediately of any changes to the operation of the factories.
PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to join them after they have paid £189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymara out of the contract, but did this French team of Barcelona warn of their record breach three years ago?
This sensational move has unleashed the waters of the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club set to surpass the previous record of more than double the amount of money earned by Paul Pogby's move to Manchester United, who paid him £89 million last season.
Once confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world - after taxation, he will be charging PSG over £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are angry at the way Neymar has been out of contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to please Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the world of football alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs interested in taking over one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll definitely contact one of their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face consequences.
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG defender Marc Verratti last summer.
PSG has made it clear that under no circumstances will it allow the departure of the Italian representative, so it is possible that Barcelona is now taking a bitter pill for its bold actions with Neymar's departure.
Who's going to explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understandable rules?
Donald Trump has been waving at anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And the day before, Trump wrote that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that it would not continue to do so.
Even the thought of a penalty is as clean as a straw from a shoe.
You can't put that stuff in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela has really set out on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not acting the way the American president would like.
Russia is a chapter of its own.
But if anyone wanted to summarize it so that even the average voter, American, European or otherwise, could understand what it is and what system of rules the sanctions policy is based on, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only touches what President Obama has already planned, only gives it an enforcement stamp.
Then why the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not being relaxed, they're being tightened.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like kosher is just sanctions sanctioned by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher and anti-Russian sanctions from the EU.
European Commission President Juncker has complained that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Like they're supposed to use sanctions that are only so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The regular voter is a fool.
For three years, he's heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends solely on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It turns out that this is about EU energy security.
The voter's getting more and more.
Russia gets sanctions for getting too close to where it's not supposed to be.
China is being flattered for not assembling enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, a rule or a rule?
I'm not thinking about working with Okamura.
Andrei Babiš is married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Apart from Pardubice County, he's got all the candidates ready.
According to his own words, he didn't interfere with them in any significant way.
He even agreed to have the Moravian-Silesian school run by the Hejtman and Shadow Minister of Education, Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether to be an MP or a heightman", Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You've angered many lawmakers and politicians across the country with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run towns and cities themselves, with only managers.
You mean that?
It wasn't like that.
I'm a direct democracy supporter, we elect the president directly, and I'm convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
I'm not talking about the disruption of the deputies in my book, they can be there.
The question is how many will be.
When you presented your book What I Dream When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard you speak out about the abolition of representation.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct elections and a reduction in the number of deputies.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 councillors.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 deputies.
And the mayor is accused of building little and not planning big projects, but she's not competent for that.
The same is true of a government that has been run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it right.
But the current prime minister is not doing anything, he's just moderating the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to impose a majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to get around.
We only have a change in the agenda for a one-round Senate election.
We also proposed a rolling mandate for ministers and a change in the House Rules of Procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibition of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees from performing at House meetings.
It's definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator, you will run the government, control the House of Representatives with 101 members, abolish the provinces and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors, control the entire country.
It's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislative body by a third, while there are 57,000 Frenchmen per legislator, while in our country it is 17,000 Czechs.
But nobody accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins the Czech elections by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
The odds for a parliamentary majority are too high, but you can look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like this is a threat to the ANO movement.
We just need a team that's going to work for the people in government, not their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree on just a pay rise for teachers, cultural workers and social workers.
Why did they vote me over and give me 21 percent more GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step up as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister should intervene when ministers are acting inexpensively, confusing the government with travel agencies and wanting to do business with state money like Marian Juriecka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in government should not argue, they should speak out.
The cabinet has to have ready-made material, no room for coalition riots, power voting and bargaining, to decide.
How do you want a cohesive team when ministers are mostly partisan?
There's a constitutional law above the pages.
When it came to breaking bread, Saturday said the coalition agreement was off, and he fired Grandma from the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he's a personality and has the ability to drive, a similar gesture is not necessary.
He measures everyone the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would nominate as finance minister?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't be in this government, and nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I did that was so terrible.
So much skepticism is out of place.
The mayor's got a businessman, a grandfather who would like to work with you, and maybe a man like you, a guy named Jiří Čunk, will win the people's wing.
I don't think he is.
The CSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus Jr. may be prosecuted in the ODS, which he will not oppose either.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of economics.
So the O'Reilly's coming into the picture as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has a history of politics, running as a puppet for the V.U. of Vita Barta, then getting money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
He's a prominent figure, of course.
But it's a little brown.
If I take his program, there's a broad public involvement in the running of society, direct democracy, that's for sure.
I'm not asking you that.
I wonder if you'd consider a man who has xenophobic views, speaks at a schizophrenic demonstration and wants to leave the EU?
We're not considering working with Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the communist support of your minority government?
I can't imagine it either, but the voters decide.
It's gonna be a winner-to-win series, but God knows who's gonna win and who's gonna be number two.
Of course, it's important that they're able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's get back to your efforts to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow suit, Prime Minister Sabotka let everything go, never decided.
Coalition affairs like the CEB or EGAP didn't work.
Saturday is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, the CZE took control of the Czech government.
It's incredible that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the CEEC management, which he's putting to the finance minister to vote on at the CEEC General Assembly.
If you were prime minister, would you change the staffing of the supervisory board and change the top management of the CZE?
Jesus, if I'm the prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not him yet.
Rumor has it that the C.E.S. has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with the CSSD for even better cooperation with the ANO.
So, after the election, things will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a lobby of the Humility or the Pink, I'm a separate unit, and I'm not solving this at all.
Then answer me straight.
If you become the head of government, will you seek to replace the CEZ, Czech TV or General Health Insurance, the institutions you criticize?
I want the CZE to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wants for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look into Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has a majority in the C.E.R., he never led it, he was only there in numbers, which is bad.
It's a trivial matter to me.
The CZE is to take the Dukovans, evaluate them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, run a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should fund and build new nuclear power plants is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I have no and will have no competence to fire anyone.
But control is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about $7.2 billion a year for public broadcasting, but they don't really know how these institutions are going to handle it.
How can they not know?
The House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at the way these reports are negotiating the superpower pact of Sabotka Kalousek that always worked.
