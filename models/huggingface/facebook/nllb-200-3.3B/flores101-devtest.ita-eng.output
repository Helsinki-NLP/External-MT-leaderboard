Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely accepted theory, but it also provides more detail than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur plumage lacks the basic structure of the tail, but instead has other features of feathers, beards, and barbels, the researchers concluded that the tail was likely the result of evolutionary development after these features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers speculate that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the plumage of a chick.
The researchers hypothesize that although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not that of a chick.

The brightness is used in conjunction with the rotation to define a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity relative to the magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for had to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in this galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth that generates tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same as those of "normal" matter.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is gathered in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.

Dr Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement issued in an interview, this new variant was "highly concerning and alarming, because of its high mortality rate".
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the germ inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health workers at the hospital itself.

Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University team of astrogeologists in Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground".
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no ballot boxes are present at the start of voting and that no ballot boxes are inserted other than those of the voters, duly numbered and authorized.
Candidates may send their representatives to assist at each stage of the process, and in the evening, volunteers perform the counting of the votes under strict control, in accordance with the specific procedures.

Her other race, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's sitting category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than first-place finisher Claudia Loesch of Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's group failed to finish their downhills, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police have managed to recover the laptop and mobile phone that were stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have also found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were freeing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She's being held pending trial and sent for trial, but any testimony from an eyewitness could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish courts have different parameters, as the Scottish courts have found the publication of the photos potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University, "journalists who post photos or other material of suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the judicial proceedings, has told reporters that no further comment will be given at least until the indictment is filed.
According to leaked reports, the document will be about the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues reportedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the experimental pest control program had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council for Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry of Justice's response to the Commission's letter of formal notice was that the Commission had not taken into account the fact that the Commission had not provided the information requested by Apple.
The Mariana Islands earthquake was reported at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office there have been no reports of damage in the nation.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In the Philippine capital of Manila, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Most of the hostages were rescued, at least six are dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career as a physician.
After training in obstetrics, she went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' of flight records on Wednesday.
His wrestling buddies also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman".
"Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... let's hope she's in a better place", was Dustin "Goldust" Runnels' comment.
According to the poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the acting Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of the respondents, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but has been blamed for several disorders that have led to doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to get through the pain because they're banned from the Games.
January 25 Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, the stuff that makes proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed after colliding with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office as governor since the beginning of this year; last month he signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He said speculation was nothing but "political chatter and idiocy".
He's running for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel a year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than the obsolete ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being provided and no surface trains will stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks or interchange car parks available on site.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility of having the match played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
A new species of bird is believed to have been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although the time needed for this process was thought to be much longer, due to mating between a Darwin's endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a fine thread, suitable for twisting and weaving.
It can be made very thin and glued onto other metals. It has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" because of its ability to be made so thin.
This is called the pH of the substance, and using the juice of red cabbage, it is possible to construct a pH indicator.
The color of the cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the pH letter H).
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are formed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, stick them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands and the outer layers will react to create a strange sensation and form a shell.
Almost all houses in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water and a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewerage systems have been discovered.
In ancient times, bathrooms also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted into public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and the view.
To carry a satellite or a telescope into space requires a rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world enormously, and among the many benefits it has brought to us, the most important is that it has provided us with easier and faster transportation.
His invention gave birth to the train, the automobile, and various other means of transportation.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on smaller prey, which are considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a particular goal that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of all felines and live in large groups called packs.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and pups that can reach up to 30.
Usually the females are closely related to one another, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pack behaves much like the wolf pack or the dog pack, whose behavior is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not other big cats), even as regards deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: The tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a traction force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as the lion's, but it is more like a row of shouted, angry words.
Oocelots love to eat small animals, and if possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing out the land where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move around stealthily, and to hunt their prey, ocelots blend in with their surroundings and then swoop down on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in an environment different from the one in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so to pose as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those needed previously.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from one another that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed in by humans and absorb carbon dioxide that is expelled by humans (through exhalation).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, much of the food we eat is made from plants, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws bore more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row on the palate, so that anyone who crossed its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that it had a forked tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with it.
Although much of their food would seem familiar, Roman banquets also featured various strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent species called the ghiro.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate seated on chairs, the rich men enjoyed banqueting together by lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that were brought to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was accessible only to the priests.
Occasionally, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Because of the mild climate of the Middle East, the house was not of primary importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were simply open-air stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was especially expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas say that it was Erik the Red who named it after his encounter with Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Templar Mystery", you might think that there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false, even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, probably, the annotation was just attached as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had brought northern France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what became known as Operation Dragoon.
American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were moving toward Germany.
By civilization, we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work in a collaborative manner, forming a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, which means civil; the term is in turn connected with civis, or citizen, and civitas, or city or city-state, and in some way therefore defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means passing on knowledge across generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, lacking a national executive or judicial branch, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and interstate duties.
Amending the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, which for their part had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national football team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most prevalent in the northern regions and see Italians committed to competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of island groups that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through it gradually recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Wonderful Island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces; in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today, and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The ratios of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-used and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had been a bond between the European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the fundamentals of Christianity is that wealth should serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money reserves exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any military and civilian essential supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated the international law usually accepted and codified by many international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different time periods were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces, most notably the so-called Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which also lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the more ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since Army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the earthly life, and he used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave rests on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you knew it existed, because once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the world around you.
Of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to our day in an intact state.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures erected in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and relatives of the pharaoh.
The 'upwards' indication looks like a V and the 'downwards' indication looks like a square without a bottom.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the forearm (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow produces a stronger, more distinct sound.
You may decide to add your own customized pencil markings, but keep in mind that the archery marks you find printed have a musical value, so in general they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in a state of terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and Elisabeth, the king's sister.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and shouted threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover much of the expense, and the interest on the bonds was floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous gains derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events unfolded is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the destiny of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, treated by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time, customs, customs and culture have arisen linked to this geography which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similar to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its prestige declined, primarily because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
But the slowness of the communication channels means that the spread of styles in the West may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most significant developments of the period, as a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as farming that is carried on for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of an organic type, using preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries, this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their membership through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fads, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "savages" or "wildlings". Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it shows behaviours (within the physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning is supposed to make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the little graffiti-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, if not extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn't provide them with food, care and education, but it does.
We believe foster care is a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to make up for any unmet needs in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic features of the Internet bring additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people who are unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even argues that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variation is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variations.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its own amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In view of this, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to how the savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the period of normal sleep, followed by a resumption of sleep (1060 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the watch in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm include drinking plenty of fluids before going to sleep (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace that is in direct proportion to the tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive life force there is, and each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayana rite and by various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the fulcrum of Tibetan meditation, through the depiction of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had become enemies; the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, soon proved outdated, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian frontiers, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguard of its ability to move people and goods, while countering the same ability of the enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the most recent and most noteworthy examples of this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, in which the Americans were trying to move men and goods across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had a chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be bred by ancient cultures and tribes for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Domestic goats were usually reared in free-roaming herds on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply parallel wooden axles, the wagonways, compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses travelling on them to reach greater speeds and to move heavier loads.
The tracks were introduced relatively early to hold the tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first known means of transportation for man was the legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, was not used to walking upright.
Signs of bipedal gait specialization are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate some of the future suffering we can start by adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even become activists.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant life-style of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to the John Dunlap printing office a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, known today as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap liner notes still known are the oldest extant copies of the document.
According to many paleontologists today, a class of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and they are what we call birds.
Many people tend not to think of them as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T.Rex, they have scaled feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers used today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of indoor poisoning could be the presence of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals in the home.
Check the label for first-aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become parasites of man.
Both bedbugs and killer bedbugs are nest-dwellers, that is, they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, MS has about 400,000 known cases, making it the number one neurological disease affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own best interests, or that of their child.
These couples have the choice of adoption plans for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method, and this method actually guides most of the scientific inquiry.
But it is not just experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also allows scientific research to be guided.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the gradual decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behaviour are strongly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, which are viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the cells involved belong to the germline.
The mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is the attraction of people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the oranges of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country towns to drive to work, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic of going back and forth, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has allowed human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transportation systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges that are falling apart.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they failed every day, are the engineers who design them incompetent, or is there deeper motivation?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to escape their enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their bodies.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small openings to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and other stars too), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times the amount of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on earth, reaching six miles in width at some points.
Twenty percent of the total water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and is fed by thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the grandeur and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, who were by then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually more closely resemble the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but he also theorized that they would transform into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minute amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Since its invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to less and less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on their computer screens and never has to go near a temperamite.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then, by further splitting the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rock and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km (43 mi) thick at its nearest side and 100 km (62 mi) thick at its farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the upwelling of the lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what some people have in common and what makes them want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that make them do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start to manage their former colleagues, two behaviours can emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to enforce disciplinary action, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the whole team's operation and do it himself.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This attitude often creates dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings may take place according to the various time zones, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team that each member refers to and sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation be willing to go through the long process of building a learning organisation?A good reason to implement organisational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you manage to use all available resources in an effective way across all functional departments in an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological findings have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, the area of inquiry becoming narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that we have never observed before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite its strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important branch of computing that deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of applications are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games.
The tour is a fundamental part of teaching, and teachers often want to take their pupils to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution is technology with virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in a classroom.
The virtual school trip is also a great way to share experiences and travel thoughts with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the nation's capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, and while their first experiences with blogs are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience can change things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the blog author is committed to improving his writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students to become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's picturesque, bilingual capital, home to art galleries and museums that tell the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and further north is the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka region and more.
All of this and more makes Ontario uniquely Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The larger areas to the north are sparsely populated, among these some are almost uninhabited wild moors.
If you compare the population, the result may surprise many: In the United States the number of African-American citizens is greater than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are situated in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated nations of France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which made a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, from Europe to India, by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way for European influence and colonialism.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: it is recommended that all women declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they themselves consider to be harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, to be grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city which was called Daru l-Badya, later called Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their trading bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, nargile and a lot of trinkets, but all this is reserved for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is a good idea to do some research before making any visits outside of Goma, so that you can assess the state of the fighting that still persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb to Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa's mountain gorillas.
A boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to get around Goma, and the normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctù" ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main stops.
With its more Arab than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and south to the Crocodile River.
Covering an area of 19,500 km2, the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and park admission.
The purchase of a Wild Card may also be useful, as it gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a shimmering bar chart, made all the more evident by the fact that it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the heavily populated reclaimed land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of this land's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain the remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is marshland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; the area is estimated to have 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses that run between districts are often crowded, it is wise to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable, sturdy, small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby localities, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trusses are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two 3.50-meter wide lanes.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres underneath, and was completed in August 2011, but opened to traffic in March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge is expected to be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and were semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the native groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and indigenous peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound Sterling (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley often accepts credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outer islands, although British and US currency may be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures over 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely get below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem, buffalo, elk, deer, bear - virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a proper distance, and these animals need to be given adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking along or cooking foods with strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan Islands, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous Naval Sinking of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbours, and the most popular are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean-facing beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops, where you can swim safely.
The most popular local beer is a simple, pleasant, refreshing beer called "Number One".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might be better for the journey.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the flat white coffee is a foreign idea. 'Espresso' is black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on par with the Belgian, the fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many coral reef hikes are held year-round, and accidents from such causes on the reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can be found only occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, most of them are afraid of humans and tend to keep their distance.
The saltwater crocodile's habitat is primarily the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, and they do not live actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often make arrangements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp on-site, considering this a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the action, you have to get there early and get a space near the music.
Remember, once the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival where the music lingers on into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Generally, casinos do everything to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. There are generally no windows, no clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in the mood and keep them occupied.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served by the house, but intoxication affects judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you may be stuck.
Rain and snow, or the formation of ice or condensation on the windows of the vehicle, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the focal point of many visitors' vacations.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to trips by land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and therefore can be best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or walking safari) is a type of safari that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, with some events taking place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the first of which took place in 1964.
If your 2020 flight and accommodation reservation was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among them, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while normal tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear socks that are ironed, you can try a hair dryer, if available.
Care should be taken not to subject the fabrics to too high a temperature to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways of treating water, and some of these are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is sufficient; in others, it takes many minutes.
Filter effectiveness varies, so in case of doubt, consider buying water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests that are not common in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people are not usually termed harmful animals.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods free of taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive, as it often passes through isolated areas of vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is recommended that you keep your eyes peeled, as steep slopes, narrow roads, and narrow curves are common.
The speed limits shown are significantly lower than those applied in the preceding and following sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h).
Strangely, however, the coverage of the mobile phone service in this area is much higher than that of other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite flavorful and varied, similar to those of neighbouring Austria further south.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular pies often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but tasty desserts can opt for those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan curry in the inland regions is normally made with yogurt; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods native to the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The reins are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off by a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots that have heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially those made in England, were fitted with safety bars, which cause a leather strap to detach from the saddle when the rider pulls it back in case of a fall.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are dug.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking vistas, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes on its potentially endless walls.
Freediving snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and involve skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums", who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; in 1861, the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing: The activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is related, though usually not comprehended, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on rough terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a similar route to the hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you can cover some greater distances than those routes by walking, but you will only very rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on well-traveled tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but is made up of many independent countries. Normally, traveling through several countries would require applying for a visa and going through passport controls several times.
However, in this respect the Schengen area functions more like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to pass through passport control again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual Member States, thus saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique, but some tax agencies consider an object to be antique if it is at least 100 years old.
The definition differs geographically with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antique pieces, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture that underpins this trade is also the basis for many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were involved in reindeer farming on a large scale; some lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today, many Sámi people are employed in modern occupations, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a traveller's warning is issued for the destination you are visiting, there could be consequences for your travel health insurance or your insurance in the event of a cancellation of the trip.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are directed to the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Adverse weather conditions' is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon which may cause damage, serious social discomfort or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, above-normal rainfall and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea breezes and cyclones.
Among the strong regional and seasonal weather events are storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as these may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could potentially be considered a war zone must undergo vocational training.
A search of the Internet for 'Hostile Environments Course' will likely find the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A typical course lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports without gender (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents is equally variable.
Security screenings have also become much more scrupulous in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in preoperative stages should not expect to pass their screening without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Backwash currents are formed by the backflow of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back out won't be any harder than it used to be.
Try to identify an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your skills and whether you have been sighted.
Re-entry shock occurs in a shorter time than culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travellers who have found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to readjust to the culture of their home country.
By the time you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs of your home culture.
In your first experience abroad, you're likely to have met people who are patient and understanding, aware that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were needed even for those returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the show begins, you will be able to see the pyramids in the dark and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors, the sound and light show is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the highest number of bases, of which sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula, King George Island being the largest and home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, the latter of which has an active volcano caldera filled with water that has created a magnificent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula and overlooking the sea at Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only viable alternative.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for a cellular phone, because to make a call you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure boats, as well as missions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among new graduates, since they can take a year before starting college without compromising their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education on returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is a great destination for boaters, and the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and in its coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to go to the archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat is counted for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is generally rather unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Many of the various Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For landing, a separate visa will not be required (from 2009) using the on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of; it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest toward other things.
For some people, a little understanding of how airplanes work and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver goods quickly, and often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems arose.
On some routes, air freight would take days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: for example, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business travel and up to eleven times the first-class fare!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it's not even worth looking for discounts on first- or business-class seats.
The airlines are well aware that there is a class of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and they therefore charge certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation crossroads.
The ancient city of Smyrna is situated on a huge bay, surrounded by mountains, and is now a modern, developed, and active commercial center.
Although the city has a Mediterranean-European feel rather than a traditional Turkish one, the wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church's sacristy, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible, and made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's brilliant account of its splendour.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of Marian apparitions that are famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and it has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish.About half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used in public transport and other services.
In the metro, the regular announcements are only in Catalan, and any unplanned interruptions of service are communicated in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are notoriously self-centered, rude and conceited.
Although often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel at home in Paris is to behave in the best way possible, to relate as a "bien élevé" (well-educated) person, which will certainly make your travels easier.
The rough exterior of the Parisians will quickly fade if you display some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly beech, beech and spruce, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of different microclimates, soils and altitude levels, it has a great variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the rooster live in these places, along with several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stole for women who come unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the store at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular summer dinner: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, except the pronoun "you" used for the courtesy form "you", always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantivized form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and the g, as their pronunciation changes with the following vowel.
Also, make sure that you pronounce the "r" and "rr" differently: caro means dearly beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of its words are regular.
So, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimal knowledge of Spanish may jump to the conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and should not be studied separately.
Today, pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete and serve as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or on campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept originated in China, where prune blossoming was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants do their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking a few specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, no argument.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy almost anything once you get there.
But being in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with heat (always) and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you wish to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to plan a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube, or sail on the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of well-known hiking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
One tradition involves spending the night of Easter in an open-air location, staying awake to watch the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual connected with spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the considerable distance from the mainland, the mammals could not make the journey, and this led to the giant tortoise becoming the principal grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you can experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark for most of the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office clothing is normally a jacket and tie or a suit and colleagues are addressed by their surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the commitment of the group rather than to individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval for every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without question.
