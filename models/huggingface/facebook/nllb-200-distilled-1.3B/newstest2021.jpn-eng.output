The full report of the cut ((CanCam.jp)) - Yahoo! news
Add the layer to the heavy semilongs and all the real-life breezes and hair.
CanCam model Hoshi, who aspires to "be beautiful, of course, but with a very high professional consciousness and respect!", challenge the real-life, moving hairstyle of the Tanaka ladies.
In fact, I asked Mr. Hosaki, who is actually doing the haircut for Mr. Tadashi Takayama, at the SUNVALLY hair salon in the downtown area, to do it for me.
I'll report the cutting process!
Nakamura46 山下美月, first cover story with short hair!
First, check the hair on the back of the head before cutting.
It's small and delicate, more and more.
There are also disadvantages, especially in the rainy season, to wear straight palms, as they can make you feel drowsy.
It is a heavy semirong with flowing front hair.
The cutting finally begins!
To make it easier to cut, first, we lightly wet the whole thing.
Then, we cut the bee's upper (the most prominent part of the head above the perimeter) and cut it from below.
By the way, the hair point that brings you closer to the real man is here!
1 Taburbang by slightly shortening the inside of the forehead, making it a little thicker when you lower it full, lightly dividing it into a skin-permeable seams... etc. Enjoy the change depending on the styling.
2 Cuts that use hair extensions and that if a multi-haired hairless person loses too much hair, it spreads too much.
While consulting the balance around you, maintain a balance that is easy to handle and spread, and that your own nest can live in.
3 A cut that makes a gap between the layer around the face and the hairline layer.
Putting a layer around your face makes it easier to move, with a cute finish.
The hairstyle, which is made in three places, front and back, is also stylish when you comb your hair together.
Cut the hair on the bee that was separated and put together, around the face.
Pulling the hairline in front of the upper part of the face, cut the hairline a little bit at a time.
This will make it easier to move, keeping the gap when the hair is lowered, and it will make it easier to move (this is a layer cut).

Young wrestler Tyler Hero, who carries the future of the hit, is once again praised by Butler for "not thinking like a rookie" (Basketball Count) - Yahoo! news
The Heat's first practice game was against the Kings.
The game, which ended in a quick 104-98 win, saw Duncan Robinson score a team-high 18 points, Tyler Heroes follow with 15 points and backcourt activity.
Robinson, the league's top shooter, of course, the rookie, the 13th overall pick in the draft, the hero's step-up will be a key factor for the Heat.
The Hero missed 15 games in February and March due to an ankle injury and the season finally entered a long hiatus with a comeback game against the Hornets on March 12.
The hero said that "there was plenty of time and I was able to get back to 100% condition; it's the best feeling I've ever felt", but that his performance in the scream was more convincing than words.
The delayed merger of forward point guard Kendrick Nunn increased the hero's playtime and took advantage of that opportunity.
The 15 points for a different role than usual and a great performance are worth a lot of money.
Team leader Jimmy Butler praised the hero of "Favorite" again this time.
"He can handle, he can score, he can defend, he can do everything for the team, he can play in any position, because his thinking is not rookie, he watches videos and studies, he watches where his teammates move and how they feel free, and he's banging his head on what he should do about it".
Since before the start of this season, Butler has been liking the hero's rookie-like strength of loser spirit and stoic posture when dealing with basketball.
That's why I've invited you to my personal practice starting at 4am, and trained with me.
Butler once said, "He speaks his mind to anyone and does not back down. Such a struggle is respectable".
The butler is the type of person who always thinks that what he thinks is the right thing to say, and if he thinks it's for the good of the team, he will take a hard line, knowing that conflict will occur.
It has also caused a deterioration in the relationship between teammates in the past.
The butler is probably overlaying the hero's youthful self on top of the hero's.
The butler's character, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to come about it.
If the relationship between two mutually respectful coaches can be extended to the entire team, the Heat should be a team that can go even higher.

Saitō, who was tied, did not even step on the second pitch, with a good shot to keep six shots to one, and shattered his three-year-old goal.
The number 10 is a favorable reception as a synergistic effect with "The 2 year exit will stimulate 3 years more.
The team, which aims to enter the top four for the third consecutive year, including last year's Shizuoka Conference, does not intend to make the rest of the game a memorable one.
16 musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gathered in the world of singing with the prefectural people - Yahoo!ニュース
I want to bring the lively singing of 浜・中・会津 to the whole world - 。
Sixteen musicians from Fukushima prefecture came together and created a message song.
The lyrics capture the downtrodden image of Fukushima Prefecture as it steps towards recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Tokyo Electric Power Plant Fukushima I nuclear accident, and fights the novel coronavirus.
Blowing out the prefectural folk songs, the "full version" will be finished by next summer, which marks the tenth anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was posted on the video posting site "YouTube".
The song is called "Pray from Fukushima" ▽
It can put people's positive attitude on a bright and vibrant melody, with the thought of "I want to convey from Fukushima".
The impact of the new coronavirus has forced live music venues, which used to be the hub of musical activity, to a hiatus; many musicians have lost their places to perform and sing.
It's because of the unseen that, in order to believe in the power of music, the project was initiated by the singer-songwriter Nappo (Napo) Mr. (46) from the city of Nam Samara, who is a resident of the city's music group "Mehikari Boys" (DAZU-O) Mr. (37).
Ms. Nappō composes the lyrics and music, and Ms. Dazo is responsible for the rapping.
When the project started in March of the coronavirus crisis, singer-songwriter MANAMI from Fukushima City, 28), and 野潤, 38, took turns approving, and the circle quickly expanded.
Ms. Napo says with a feelingless expression, "You have become a luxurious face that is unthinkable in normal times.
As a precaution against infection, there was no opportunity for sixteen people to gather, each recorded at their live house or home.
In an attempt to promote the project, a painter from the city of Kawasaki drew an image character.
It follows the prefecture of Fukushima, and with its blue and green colors represents a natural, rich landscape.

Internet information is used to instantly detect and prevent a crisis from occurring (JBpress) - Yahoo! news
"I want to know as soon as possible where and what disasters or accidents have occurred!"
This is not only a strong need for media outlets such as TV and newspapers, but also for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and municipalities.
The service that responds to this is "Specty" developed by Spectee, which handles AI-based information analysis.
 Photo  Alert from Spectre allows a team of experts to judge the authenticity of social media information 
Now, the first means by which people learn about disasters and accidents is starting to move from television to internet information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter have become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
But the task of constantly watching the information that is floating around and extracting useful information from it is difficult for human hands.
Specti has the capability to detect and analyze the content of information about natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and others, and use it to distribute it to businesses to determine the truthfulness of the information.
"The broad positioning of events with negative impacts such as halting or stagnating social activity as 'crises' " (Cheng Zhijirou, Deputy CEO) ‒ a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring at home and abroad.
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specti, after which the adoption movement spread rapidly among enterprises.
Spectri is now used by more than 350 companies in the country, including not only media outlets such as TV stations and news agencies, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, as well as municipalities in different parts of the country.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of the "crisis"
Specti delivers information in four steps: "collecting information", "analyzing and categorizing content", "titling", and "truth or falsity".
The companies should specify in advance the areas they will use, the areas where they will collect information (such as capital prefectures and city municipalities), and the categories of crisis (such as disasters and accidents).
Specti collects posts that fall under its specification using the API provided by the social media platform.
Next, it analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if a video is uploaded showing a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, or orange flames coming out of a room, it is categorized as "fire".
In addition, images of a rolling car are categorized as "traffic accidents" and images of a water-covered road are categorized as "road crown waters".
Specthy also makes estimates of the location of disasters and accidents.
"As the location is often unclear from the post, I am combining different information and making assumptions", the CEO of the village said.
For example, if an image or video has road signs or signs on it, it can extract location information from it and compare it to a place-name database to identify a location.
The Angels, in their opening game, lost to the Sajonaras... the Valley is 1 of 5 and 9 times full, with 3 3-pointers (baseball kings) - Yahoo! news

The third of his five 1-1 starts, he faced right-handed second baseman Petit in a one-on-one with a one-death-one, and again fell to a field goal.
The fourth of eight starts with a 2-1 and 11-point lead, the fourth-seeded forward faced left-handed Dickman, fifth, as the leading hitter.
He returned the 2nd straight at a good angle to the opposite direction, but instead of a fenceover, he fell to the left flank.
The Angels had an eight-run lead with a one-point lead, a two-point loss to the right-handed relief battery that allowed them to flip back, nine shutouts that were missing, and the seventh-seeded newcomer, Castro, who has been the team's No. 1 solo ball this season, to the right wing.
He caught up to the same point of 3-3 on the final stage.
Then, the second death, the second death, and the order of the fight is 2番トラウト.
Athletics Bench here announced trout's retirement, and chose the two-dead-scoring Daley Stakes.
The win was a long-awaited comeback, but it was a three-goal shootout before Athletics' guardian Hendrix.

Since Davao was the last batter to hit nine times, he was second to runner-up.

In isolation again...Jochō-mura 33 households 56 people Temporary bridge drained by increased water on the 26th day after fears of heavy rain in southern center of prefecture ((NBS Nagano broadcasting)) - Yahoo! news
In Nagano Prefecture, there is a risk of heavy rainfall in the central south on the 26th, while the central and southern parts need to be alerted for a mudslide disaster.
In Jo-Kumi Village, the prefectural roads of traffic stoppers have been swept away, once again isolating residents.
The increased water in the river will be absorbed and drained by the earthen bridge or temporary bridge.
Just after 3 a.m., I caught a surveillance camera installed by the Idita Prefectural Construction Office in Jochugumura.
This is a circular road built on the riverbed, replacing the prefectural road, which was blocked by a landslide, and which has been accessible only to residents' cars since the 17th.
With this, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area are once again isolated, and the Idada construction office is looking to get back to the rehabilitation work as the water recedes.
Warm, humid air is pouring towards the rain front, and the prefecture is expected to experience 26 days of heavy rainfall of more than 30 mm per hour over 26 days.
The 24 hour rainfall forecast up to 6 pm on the 26th is 80 mm in most areas in the center and 120 mm in the south, with a late night alert for a soil disaster in the center and south on the 26th.

"Zul-mash" "Mizenchi" is not used in the ... ?
"Words I thought weren't really dialects" (ねとらぼ) heard by residents of Chiba Prefecture - Yahoo! news
I am a resident of Chiba Prefecture, close to Tokyo.
I have lived in the same prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
"Zul mixmi", meaning "crowd-crossing", was instantly taken as a kyoton when used in a conversation with a university friend in Tokyo.
I could tell the meaning from the flow and the sense of the word, but I was told "don't use" by the people of Tokyo and Yoruba Prefecture.
― "Surely it is a "cheat-mash" → "cheat-and-break in"?
And since it seems to be connected, the meaning can be somehow guessed.
And then, one more thing.
This was pointed out and not noticed, but the expression "うちんち" meaning "my home" was not used at all when reading books or whatever, it was a dialect that you would only hear from friends, and if you were an adult you would have to check it out.
― ― Eh, "The one who killed me" was that ... ?
I also use it in my local (Kongma Prefecture), but I didn't realize it was naturally lost since I grew up ... 。
Japanese "cold or Chinese" is not good for Chinese ... ?
"Cold cooking" is not popular because of modern business - Yahoo! news
Cold in China, and Chinese is "Japanese cold".
As mentioned in the introduction, cold and Chinese is a Chinese cuisine (Japanese Chinese) of Japanese origin, conceived on the basis of China's "cool face (Lianbanmien/冷和混ぜそば) ".
Thus, although it did not originally exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it has become common to see it in Japanese cuisine stores in the summer.
Also recently, Japanese confectionery has also featured an orange product marked "Japanese 麦冷面/麦冷面/Chinese" and "Kiwa-chan chicken silk cold/Sichuan wind chicken cold/Chinese".
On the other hand, pushed by the popular punchy-effective Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine, the popularity of Japanese Chinese in China is not at all high.
Of course, Japanese-Chinese flavors are often familiar to the Chinese as well.
Therefore, while not unpalatable, they tend to be criticized as having little impact.
"Cold or Cold China" is no exception, and is still a minor presence in China.
Because, in China, the name for cold or Chinese is "Japanese cold".
To the Chinese, it is recognized as one of the Japanese cuisines.
The summer fix is "cool leather" (Liangpi) 
In China, when it comes to cooking that feels like summer, isn't it "cool skin (lianying) "?
In Japan, I think many people are not familiar with it, but cool skin is a flatbread made from wheat flour, rice flour, denpoon, etc. originating in the province of Shaanxi.
It is said to have a history of 2,000 years indeed.
It is a B-class gourmet order that is also sold at the tavern, the price is 1020 yuan (150300 yen) before and after, and is very affordable.
It has the word "cool" on it, but it can't be ice-cold like in Japan or China.
Rather, constant temperature is the basic one.
On top of it, you can top up your favorite ingredients such as chopped onions, carrots, and pickled almonds, and add spices such as pachy, parsley, raw onion, and garlic.
Finally, mixed with castor oil, castor oil, castor oil, hemp paste, peanut paste, etc., and finished with special seasonings.
Often a sore throat, a puffed-up throat, a sour, refreshingly sour, and often tangled, thick, pungent palate, often entangled in a summery mood and slipping in even when no appetite is present.
Also, because it is pervasive throughout China, there are various toppings and flavors, and the abundance of variations is also a characteristic of cool leather, one of the ways to have fun.

The benefits of a "cold water shower" for body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! news
It can reduce inflammation such as muscle pain.
A study that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, published in "The North American Journal of Medical Sciences", found that physical and mental healing effects can be expected.
It is said that by taking a cold shower after exercise, you can control muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, director of the "Korey Stringer Institute" that studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to exercise and take a cold shower as often as possible; by lowering your body temperature immediately after exercise, you can speed up recovery from exercise-induced inflammation and fatigue".
It reduces fatigue.
When exercising at high temperatures, it is said that the heart, muscles and skin usually require more blood flow.
"During exercise, higher heart rate causes more blood flow to the heart, and muscle blood flow increases because it takes energy to contract the muscles.And in the case of the skin, more blood flows to regulate body temperature", says Professor Casa.
"A cold water shower reduces the temperature of the skin, so it can reduce the amount of blood flow to the skin.Instead, it sends blood flow to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, which makes it easier for water and nutrients to be absorbed after exercise.As a result, it can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise".
Looking forward to the Hormisis effect.
Ms. Drozzewski also explains that by bathing in cold water, one can expect the "Hormose effect" to be triggered.
The Hormistic Effect is the idea that it is better to have a little of harmful substances and stress in the body than none at all.
"Low-oxygen exercise, pushups, and cold water showers are representative examples of what can be expected from the health-promoting hormistic effect. Cold water showers can stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, increasing physical/physical strength and resilience".

Osaka-san, 2nd battle of the 7th!
矢野監督『Looks and has style』 (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! news
(セ・リーグ, 中日2-5阪神,7th round, Osaka4win3lose,24,NagoyaD) The momentum of the 4th round is not going to stop.
The ball, which danced high and upward, hit the left-wing seat midfield.
Oyama throws two consecutive arcs, diamonds for a week.
When I got back on the bench, I had my white teeth.
"While I was getting a good swing, I was able to squeeze a target ball and swing willingly".
Four 0-2 rounds, entered the table with a lead.
He was active from the first ball and was active from the second ball after the foul.
I didn't miss the 134kg slide with the sugar in it by Ogawa.
The ball held in the center of the ball is a perfect hit that is sure to be a stand-in at the moment of the hit.
Two matches in a row following the Battle of Hiroshima on the 23rd the previous day, one shot was fired in a counterattack.
It was also a valuable book, beaten by a person with whom he was struggling.
Against Ogawa, the 17th game at the Takako Garden was a 9-4 draw and a 4-1 attack.
But, limited to Nagoya Dome, it had suffered seven straight losses in the draw since August 23, 2013, allowing seven wins, one loss and one hold in the last 12 games.
From such a difficult opponent, he took away the score for the 23rd inning at Nagoya Dome with a lavish one-shot, not passing the flow of the game.
Manager Yayoi Yano also expressed his expectation of further explosions, saying, "It's a high level to be able to hold the sweet ball tightly; look and have style; timing and hitting are in the foul; I think he'll still hit".
He is hitting right-forward at one time, this marks six consecutive shutouts and three consecutive multiple shutouts.
The opening was a slow start, but the 7th and 16th-seeded teams are already doing a fine job as the team leader and No. 4.
For the sake of victory, I will continue to leave results from now on.

Macau Casino Supervisory Authority inspected the implementation of the quarantine measures in the casino facilities... a novel coronavirus negative certificate at the entrance is required.
Forty casinos outside Macau, which were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 during the COVID-19 pandemic, have reopened operations under strict prevention and control measures since February 20.
Macau's casino regulator DICJ requires operating companies to protect the health of employees and guests to the maximum extent possible when reopening, ensuring distance between gaming tables, making sure seats are available for table games (for example, a baccarat table can seat 34 people at a time at one table), and slot machines are also set to operate with one or two machines, reducing the risk of cross-infection.
Sanitisation of gaming supplies such as chips has also been intensified.
Guests are also required to provide a tip on mask wearing, quarantine, valid health code (recent stay history, contact history with a new coronavirus patient, fever and cough symptoms, generated by entering contact information) upon entry.
From 0:00 a.m. on July 15, a tip of a negative certificate of a novel coronavirus nucleic acid test (limited to those within the validity period issued by an authorized facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was also added to the condition.
In the context of the newly made mandatory presentation of a negative certificate, the relaxation of water measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6 am on the 15th (with the lifting of the 14-day quarantine, subject to conditions) will be an accompanying precautionary measure.
The DICJ announced that on July 18, following the change in the entry conditions from July 15, the head of the agency, Ho ((Adrianō Ho) inspected the implementation of the prevention measures in the casino facilities, and held a meeting with representatives of the security departments of the 6 casino operating companies, requesting again to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly controlling the entrance of guests.
The DICJ stated that it will continue to conduct strict patrol patrols of casino facilities in the future, will have the opportunity to meet regularly with operating companies as the situation and assessment develops, and will also adjust quarantine measures in casinos accordingly, in line with the Government Health Service guidelines.
The casino facility visit was also accompanied by Linus Linus directors of the Health Bureau's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who were instructed on the spot on disinfecting gaming (casino) chips and how to handle safe distance between seats on electronic casino machines.
However, due to the sharp decline in inbound travelers due to prevention measures, including entry restrictions, the cumulative casino sales for June 1 of this year remained at $3.37 billion Macau potatoes (in Japanese yen: about $4.51 billion yen), down 77.4% from the same period last year.
A light breeze from the hot spring is substituted for the next moon, the festival of the watermelon message to healthcare workers (Northeast News Agency) - Yahoo! news
The hot springs, where the annual "Waterfall Festival" was cancelled due to the impact of the novel coronavirus, will begin to be used with waterfalls with messages of support for healthcare workers starting August 1.
They put up about 350 pieces of paper written by fans and locals from all over the country, wrapped the hot springs in aerial light, and brought healing to visitors.
The Mambobo Festival is an event recreating the festival featured in the anime "Flowers Blooming" which is modeled on the Tsujuku Hot Springs and is organized by the Tsujuku Hot Springs Tourism Association.
Starting in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, every year, a large number of anime fans from all over the country visit it.
Every day, from the lighting ceremony in July until October of this festival, a torch is lit on the steps leading to the Tōjō-jō-jō Shinto Shrine in Tōjō-jō.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new coronavirus, but after a series of voices from local and national fans saying "it's a shame not to have a bubble in the hot summer", the association came up with the idea for the project.
I wanted to contribute a little bit to healing and recovery in a world that is struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, so I signed up for the "Recovery Campaign".
So far, we have asked each of the approximately 50 local Tuong Shuicho and Chihara children's students to write a picture message to each other, and there are over 100 applications from across the country.
Message paper can be purchased from the association's homepage, filled out, put in a return envelope and sent to the association, and then attached to a lamp post and photographed.
1 set is 6,000 yen, and we will accept applications until we reach a total of about 350 sets of bamboo.
The bulb lighting is scheduled to last until the end of November.
Mr. Yamada Shiohiro, who has been the executive committee chairman of the festival since the first time, said "we can be encouraged when we read the message; we want to hold the festival, which will be the 10th edition next year, with great fanfare".
For the campaign, I also provided drawings and illustrations of various characters and the Asano-Kawa Bridge.
From the 1st, users of the hotel's special accommodation plan in the hot spring will be presented with an illustrated clear file.

Then, in the last 6 games, the batting average is 10.8 minutes and 2 seconds and the third-ranked Forest at the bottom of the table decides the sending bat.
Yamashita Kagawa's 4th was declared out of the game, and from this day forward, Yasaki, who was replaced by Sōsen and returned to No. 5, smashed Ichida's straight ball, tying it for a 3-2 victory.
Hero Okazaki said, " (Yuneda's safety) was impressed by me on the bench and I thought I had to do something about it; I thought my friends in the band also trusted me behind the band and kept me connected".
The four from the 13th-year draft's No. 1, No. 2, Sōsen, Yamakō, No. 14, No. 3 Okazaki, and No. 16 No. 3 Yūken-ta were the core of what team officials call "our heartbeat right now".
Both have considerable experience as amateurs, and have a double sense of responsibility.
As for Yasaki, who took over the captaincy from Yamakawa in his fourth year at Fujitsu, "Yamakawa is a captain who pulls the team along with his words anyway because he's a good talker; conversely, I'm a talker, so I was the type to let the good vice-captain talk, stand behind him", as each one of them, while showing off their personality, supported the new general manager's Yukoneda, the new player's chairman's forests.
The director called "Yuneda's safety? that's not a sign. but I thought 'you can go'. my friend was a great bantam too. my friend Yuzaki was a good hitter".
All four are now struggling with a batting average of 25-5 but are supporting the team with the wisdom to win without batting.

After standing on the pulpit of the "書調室" (ばんしょしらべしょ), the Western studies research and education institution of the shogunate, he opened a private school, the "Pigeon Room", in Edo, where he taught grammar, military science and medicine.
Even after returning to the Yangtze, he gave a lecture on military science at the Yamamoto Minron Museum.
The bronze statue focused on Iijiro as an educator.
He made it appear as if he was standing beside the planetary ritual, holding a book in his hand, giving a lecture in Lamology.
The statue, which is about 3 meters high, is said to have been made under the eyes of a disciple who was receiving a lecture from Ieyasu.
The design was done by the wife of the director, Chienzo, a descendant of the local designer, Kazuo Ishibumi ().
It was established by the business executive committee (Okamobumi Chairman) after 150 years of the death of Daimura Iijiro, the parent body of the Mint Municipality, with donations raised.
About 12.8 million yen worth of clean goods were collected from 1,104 people across the country.
The operating cost, including the installation of the nameplate, is about 12 million yen.
The remaining donations will be used for maintenance of the bronze statue and other projects.
President Okamoto had said that "Ikiiro, who kept his ambitions high and made a great contribution as an educator, is the pride of the Kure; a bronze statue of hope for the children of the region who bear the future".
Mbappe, who was injured after a bad tackle, leaves the venue with a pine stick posture (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! news
Paris Saint-Germain, who beat Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final at the Stade de France on 24th local time, claimed their 13th title in two years.
PSG have won two domestic titles.
Neymar's goal in the first half to put down Santinienne in the final set the tone for the final, and PSG, who have achieved two domestic titles after the Ligue 1, are in a situation where they have to worry about the Champions League in August.
Kilian Mbappe, who started earlier in the same match, was in a position to switch injuries after a poor sliding tackle by his opponent CBroyke Pelan.
In the first half, after 30 minutes, the young French star, who was knocked down in a way that almost pinched his right ankle, frowned in pain.
The players of both teams became a flash mob over this play.
Mbappe, who appeared to have broken his right ankle, made it impossible for him to continue playing.
Pelan was presented with a red card.
After the match, Mbappe, who had fixed his right foot, leaped behind the stadium with a pine stick in his hand.
PSG will play the Coupe de la Ligue final against Lyon on August 1 at 4:10pm Japanese time, but it will definitely be impossible to use Mbappe in this match.
He will have to wait for the club's medical report to be announced, but he may miss the Champions League in Portugal.
The coronavirus "closely to art" online museum "HASARD" 野さん (from Akobō) launch (Delhi East-North News Agency) - Yahoo! news
There is a museum where anyone can touch art, free of charge, whenever they want.
The collection is diverse, from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustave Klimt to unknown artists in the country.
The online museum "HASARD" has gained even more attention since its "opening" in April 2019, capturing the hearts of users with its convenience and novelty, and embracing the new lifestyle created by the coronavirus pandemic.
The representative of Ōnō Michiya from Akobō City who launched the site, says that "we wanted to create a service where everyone could easily enjoy art.
One thing that amazes visitors to Azari is the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the portraits.
The 24th is currently open to the public with a total of 14 exhibitions of permanent exhibitions and project exhibitions, and the ultra-high-resolution works that not only convey color but also the texture of the pen draw the viewer.
There is no membership registration or entrance fee, which is characteristic of the fact that it is free not only for the viewer but also for the artist who wants to have a solo exhibition.
Showing up online can also draw attention.
Moving the painting is one thing.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It starts moving again", he uses digital processing to make clouds, flowers, meadows and so on move.
"I want to make sure that people who are not interested in art can enter" (野代表) and experience the feeling of being in a painting.
野 and the artistic team met when they were in elementary school.
At the time, while visiting the newly completed Tsuen Prefectural Museum with my family, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was struck by their compelling nature.
From the next day on, the art classes changed to fun hours, and even after flying to Tokyo for university, I started to visit galleries and so on.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have many opportunities to get in touch with art from various points of view, such as the lack of museums nearby, large project exhibitions held only in the capital region, child rearing and difficulty going out.
So, while working for an IT-related company, I spent about 2 months and launched a website where you can view art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and after the spread of the new coronavirus infection, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone could see art in a free form, whenever they wanted to see it.
Azhar's aim was accepted by more and more people, even without the coronavirus pandemic.
The representative of Ōno emphasized the meaning of art viewing, that it enriches the imagination.
"When imagination is rich, you can reach out to those in need.
"I want art to be a better society by bringing art closer to us".
The Chinese era of quality is over, the Japanese era of quality is coming: simple reason (modern business) - Yahoo! news
The pandemic has changed values.
There are various predictions and debates about the post-pandemic world.
On the business side, the July 8 article "He says 'management' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan now ... ! that's the harsh reality" , the July 4 article "In the 'post-corona' world, he says 'Japanese manufacturing' is likely to make a big comeback ... ! " etc. changes may occur".
 Photos  The true essence of "Japan's strength" that only the Japanese know about... an unexpected reality seen in Asia 
Also, on the mental side, it seems that trends like the June 26 article "A 'feeling of total burning' given to people who have become aware of the end of their lives with Corona" and the June 10 article "Corona, let's reconsider the effectiveness of 'God help us in times of trouble' right now, full of riots" are going to become mainstream.
And what seems to become clear to our eyes as the combined form of the two "materials (economic and business) " and "spirit" is the great flow of "Chinese quality to Japanese quality".
For example, it is annoying if there are defects in a T-shirt or a digital camera, but there is no other chapter in the life of the person who buys it.
In contrast, the recent hype about the quality of Chinese-made masks and respirators ... ... the "Chinese quality" in such products that directly relate to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap such goods can be bought.
Even if they pay a reasonable price, they will still seek goods of "Japanese quality".
Of course, this trend is not just happening in Japan.
The fact that Western countries, which have been in a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, have nevertheless "returned" to the extreme severity of "Chinese quality" is also evident from the fact that they have repeatedly "returned" to the extreme severity of "Chinese quality".
It's more secure than cheap.
Also, goods such as automobiles are goods whose defects can be fatal (death by accident).
Despite the aggression of countries such as China and Korea with their "cheap or bad" discount strategy, Japanese manufacturing ultimately failed to prevail and the situation described in the June 16 article "Still winning alone, will the world's automakers succumb to Toyota?" will be the same because the "Japanese quality" is strongly demanded of the automobile-like product.
And the current pandemic has reminded me that many other goods also need "reassurance".
Also, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like the toilet paper bust, even when production capacity is adequate, intermediate circulation can be delayed and not reach your hands.
Moreover, as the article of April 17th "Who are the real criminals with a lack of masks! do not tolerate the Chinese Communist regime's fire-field robbers" made it painful to feel that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "calm and safe".
If anything, it is very important that any country should be able to make its own national priorities self-evident, and to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food at home.

98% of the reflection is │
Teflon processed fries are derived from the traditional white paint, insulation and heat, which turns out to enhance the refrigeration effect!
What a great discovery!
This year was the rainy season with an unusually high annual rainfall, but if it is clear, a scorching summer will be a regular feature.
Hot and hot and hot days with so much scorching heat that even the refrigerator is useless... just imagine it, it's going to go away, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been pondering how to get through the hot, midsummer even a little more comfortably.
One way is to wear a white dress with a thin sleeve.
Well, you don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And, applying the same principle to the architecture of houses, there are increasing cases of white-painting.
Can white be white, reflect more light, and not absorb heat, and that was also the latest area of research.
The Henry Samuel School of Engineering and Applied Science at UCLA, in collaboration with researchers from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, announced that they have discovered a method of matching white paint that most efficiently reflects solar heat and boosts the cooling effect inside buildings.
We hope that an early implementation will be targeted.
The highest reflectivity of sunlight ever achieved by white paint was achieved with titanium oxide, which reaches 85% reflectivity.
White paints that already use titanium oxide are being applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, etc., to block solar heat and help improve refrigeration efficiency.
However, what has recently been discovered is a white paint derived from the fluorine resin of PTFE, which is used in the teflon processed fries and other products.
It has been found that white paint that applies this Teflon effect, reflecting sunlight to nearly 98% of the time, allows for significant heat cuts.
Even in hot summers, thanks to the unexpectedly white paint using Teflon, it's easy to stay indoors without being exposed to the extreme heat.
Maybe that time is coming soon, right?
I also find it interesting that Japanese roofs are often dark in color, but will white be the mainstream from now on?
Amazon's annual big sale, when is it this year?
CNBC reported on July 21 that Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual big-sale "Prime Day".
Although it is held every year in July, this year it was reportedly postponed due to the impact of the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
■ Spokesperson ≪ Details will be announced soon≫ An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that:
"Pride has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to for the past five years.This year we will be holding it at a later time than usual while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and suppliers".
However, it did not reveal a specific date, saying only that "details will be announced soon".
Meanwhile, the India event has been decided.
Publishing a press release on the site of the same country.
He explained that the operation will be carried out for 48 hours from 0 am on 6 August.
Although Prime Day has so far been held simultaneously around the world, this year may see exceptional measures.
■ Large event that will sell 760 billion yen in 2 days Amazon began this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure for the summer when sales are falling.
Originally a 24-hour event, it has expanded in scale each year, and last year was held for 48 hours on July 15th from 0am in 18 countries including the US and Canada, UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, Australia and Germany.
According to the company, last year, the two-day sales record surpassed the previous sales records for "Black Friday" (the first day of the year-end trade war) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
The event also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to paid membership "Prime", with last year's first day of applications setting a record for the most items in a single day, followed by the next day.
It also said it sold 175 million items of goods worldwide last year.
In this regard, Internet Retailer, an online retail industry expert, reported that the two-day global total sales were $7.16 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
A strict eye for mobile number transfers, excessive withdrawals and withholding.
What about the fee and points for payment?
(News Itch) - Yahoo! news is a news site.
The General Ministry is consolidating considerations towards a review of the same number transfer system (MNP) whereby traditional phone numbers can be kept intact when changing mobile carriers.
At its expert meeting on 21st, it indicated its policy to revise the MNP guidelines it had established in 2004.
The specific issues are varied, such as the nature of the MNP fee and whether or not to withhold funds from those seeking to transfer.
With backlash from telecommunications companies also expected, attention is focused on whether it can be linked to the promotion of healthy market competition.
The original user charge in 2006 when the black MNP of telecommunications companies was introduced was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three mobile telecommunications giants is estimated to reach 15.9 billion yen per year.
The State Department listed the current situation around the MNP at the Working Group on the Verification of Competition Rules (WG) at a meeting of experts on the 21st to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market and other issues.
The issuance of the MNP reservation number, which is required when consumers switch to other telecommunications companies, was also mentioned in the timetable.
The major telecommunications companies are accepting on the web, but for convenience of the operation of the base-system, the acceptance time range is 9-20 hours mainstream.
The WG material clearly stated that the direction of further consideration would be to use the principle of round-the-clock support.
It is also problematic to try to deter people who wish to transfer to MNP by giving them points from mobile phone companies.
This is because of the judgement that excessive withholding may hinder fair competition.
North Junsu, a partner at the Nomoura Integrated Research Institute, which is a WG component, suggests that "we will either take the time to explain the provision of economic benefits or get permission from users and end up quickly issuing a number to unauthorized users.
However, in a series of arguments, a structural problem lies with the MNP fee: "The higher the customer outflow, the harder the incentive to actively lower it will work" (an official from the Prime Minister's Office).
There is also concern that if a businessman comes out to take the lead in lowering the MNP fee, the outflow of customers from that company will increase and the business effort will not be rewarded.
The Ministry also noted that many countries abroad do not charge user charges for MNP, and that Japan is also likely to do so.
The Ministry of Home Affairs intends to compile the WG's findings into a report by September-October, after which it will begin the procedure for amending the MNP guidelines.
The period in which the amendment is made shall be considered to be after the 21st year.
Mobile carriers are likely to have a headache, including how to sell and customer support.

Takano finished with six shots on 83 balls, but at the same time as the midfield was ending, manager Ryueda came off the bench and announced a pitcher's substitution.
The pitcher, who played 108 balls at the same time, was shaped to come off the mound first and was unable to secure the right to his first win of the season.

A description of diseases of the eye that affect life Health relaxation seminar Hospitality Hospitals Chief of the Department of Ophthalmology of the University of Tokyo LiVE news
Dr. Yonezawa, head of the ophthalmology department at the Hirawatte Hospital, who explained dry eye, etc.
"Low-key seminar" where the head of the ophthalmology department at the Hirahatsu Hospital explained dry eye and other things.
A "Health Relief Seminar" (hosted by Sōga News Agency, co-hosted by Yonezawa of Glasses) with experts advising on various health concerns was held on the 25th at the Yonezawa of Glasses store in Takeda City, Sōga City.
The head of the ophthalmology department at the Hirahama Hospital (small city) in the city of Hirahama commented on eye diseases that are deeply involved in life, such as dry eye and cataracts.
Dry eye is called "disease of tears", a disease in which the quality of tears deteriorates and the tears do not evenly travel across the surface of the eye.
Ms. Yoshikawa said "contact lens wearers are about four times more likely to be affected" and "avoid sleeping with long periods of use or wearing them".
He suggested measures such as placing the computer screen below eye level or keeping humidifiers in rooms with air conditioning.
It also introduced ingredients and foods that are effective in dry-i.
"The omega-3s in blue fish and other fish prevent tear evaporation, while the muqin, which is high in natto and okra, improves tear quality", he said.
As for cataract surgery, the intraocular lens, which is inserted instead of a crystal, has both monofocal and multifocal features, and touches on differences in vision, among others.
The seminar was attended by about 40 people.
As a preventive measure against the new coronavirus infection, the venue was opened in two parts in the morning and afternoon with a small number of people, pre-entry testing and disinfection, and adequate ventilation of the venue was carried out.

G Ōsaka 17歳FW 唐山, Kobe Battle What are the chances of a J1 debut?
宮本監督『Scoring power is outstanding』 (Sports reporting) - Yahoo! news
G Osaka's Miyabin Heng Yusuke, director of the 43rd G Osaka, responding to an earlier interview about the upcoming Kobe Game, which will be played on the 25th and 4th consecutive days, revealed his expectations for FW Tangsan翔, a high school senior who made the top team for the first time in the previous episode.
The commander promoted the top-ranked Tangasan in the jump class this season to bench member at the Battle of Hiroshima on 22nd.
Although he was not given a chance to play, so far in J3 we have given orders to the striker who has left 3 goals and a result in 5 games this season, "there is a highlight in terms of taking points.17 years old, but I want him to do more and more with gumption.I have seen players go abroad so young, but I want him to play with a high consciousness and appetite".
Tang Shandong played 10 games in J3 last season, scoring 8 goals, as a special-designated player.
At 178 cm, 65 kg and slim, but with a sense of taking the back of the DF with instantaneous movements, a coolness to the shot shown in front of the dense opponent's goal, the J3 boasts an impressive scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games and an amazing scoring rate.
Hiroshima was fought after FW Ademiusson, MF Kōnoshe were benched due to injury, and Tangashan had a chance, but no playing opportunity.
Regarding the battle of Kobe, director Miyagi explained the condition of Ademiusson and Hideyoshi as "neither of them is 100%, but they are both eager and prepared".
If both are kept in check, the possibility of a bench-clearing brawl with Tangashan again arises.
In Osaka, MF堂安=current PSV= is 16 years and 11 months old, FW Uzuzumi made her J1 debut at 17 years and 10 months old, and moved to the international scene at the age of 10.
Tangashan, now 17, 10 months old, who is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a continuing presence.
A Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of a river │ to a work of art that has not been restored (octane.jp) - Yahoo! news
In 1994, there was an incident in the Netherlands where a Ferrari Mondial was allegedly stolen.
Time passed and the police couldn't solve it, but 26 years later, the Mondial was miraculously found.
The discovery of the Ferrari found at the bottom of the river was prompted by a fire department dive training.
On July 8th, a diver in training discovered something wedge-shaped sinking to the bottom of the river, and the police, even the Dutch army, were mobilized to pull it out.
By matching the VIN number to a stolen car database, I was able to link this Ferrari to an incident in 1994.
The car is handed over to the insurance company, the rightful owner, and then sent to the scrap dealer.
Scrap dealer Lowie van DE Ooyevaar says, "There are still some pieces left, but they are for art to decorate. ‒ We have already received many requests from people who want to make a table out of a dismantled Mondial. ‒ We will use engine blocks and glass plates".
No concrete sale is currently in the works, but the scrappers will store it as an object-like entity.

Porto, who won the 2019/20 season's Portuguese league, held the winning ceremony on the pitch during the home final on 20th of this month.
But even here, the fact that there was no peninsula was a topic of discussion.
Midway, which refused to merge the team practice sessions during the league's disruption due to the novel coronavirus, was then on the sidelines.
In the meantime, his absence from the winning ceremony has already led to a transfer this summer.
According to the chord, Porto was inviting the island of China to this ceremony.
It's just that the island just didn't show up.
Therefore, "Nigeria is increasingly outside of Sergio Conceição's next season plans; he will need to leave the club in the next transfer market".

45% of the families where the wife holds the wallet!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
Is there not a wife who is upset when her husband says, "I don't have enough money this month, but"... or a pregnant wife?
The family in which this conversation is taking place is the family in which the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world are there where the wife is holding the wallet?
Let's also look at the percentage of "couple wallets" "managed jointly" together.
Who's holding the household wallet?
The results of the "Survey on the Household Management of Couples" (ordered and announced in June 2012) from the Internet survey conducted by Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. among 400 men and women aged 20-30 within three years of marriage ((young couples)) and 400 men and women aged 50-60 years and older than 30 years of marriage ((mature couples)) in a total of 800 people, resulted in the following results:
Who's holding the household purse?
Wife:45.0% Husband:24.8% Households in which the wife manages household finances were the most likely to be the most successful.
Both manage, with occasional twists and turns, household management, but there seem to be various episodes.
Wife manages household affairs: In the case of A's son, A is the warm mom of Arafif, who has a daughter in the third grade of high school and a daughter in the first grade of high school.
A son is fully managing the household finances.
Due to the fact that the college exams were postponed and the school district was running a deficit for more months, I tried to negotiate a reduction in my husband's tips, but the case was rejected.
He was told, "Show me what the balance sheet is", so I showed him the household ledger.
Although all expenses were supposed to be recorded, looking at the household accounts, it was not a balance sheet sufficient to be a deficit.
Her husband was about to approach her with "I have enough", but A's son didn't think, "I understand, I'm not good at managing the household, so please manage everything yourself", and she was turned away with "Of course please".
Later, A's daughter interviewed her husband, who said that "although he was unhappy with the way the tips and other expenses were being managed, he really didn't have the time or energy to manage the various household expenses (e.g. school materials and PTA fees, etc.) ".
Husband manages household affairs: In the case of B's child, the daughter of the sole-occupier housewife, B, is living off the living expenses passed on by her husband and is making a living every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke down, so Mrs. B asked her husband to 'buy a refrigerator for me'".

This season, the move of Japan representative MF Kubota, who played for Majorca in Spain, seems to be gradually narrowing.
Although Majorka was relegated to Division 2, Kubo's performance towards the end of the season saw his rating soar.
However, due to the non-EU framework, it will be difficult to return to the same Real Madrid with "holding rights" and will play for another club next season.
Although offers have already been received from around 30 clubs, Madrid's policy is to have the Warriors train at domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper "Marca" reported that "five clubs are interested in acquiring Kubo, but Madrid wants more than a club in the middle of the league", with Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Hetafe and Betis among the strongest clubs as the transfer destination for Kubo.
Among them, Villarreal and Real Madrid have the right to participate in next season's Europa League, while Granada will also compete in the second qualifying round of the European Championship and meet the team conditions demanded by Madrid.
What decision will the world's number one big club make about the departure of "Japan's treasures"?
