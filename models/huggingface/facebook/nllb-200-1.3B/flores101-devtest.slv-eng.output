This confirms the established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, while also providing data that fossils normally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were bony-brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid-coloured on the lower side.
It also provides a glimpse into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed fist, called a rib, but have all the other characteristics of feathers  spines and scales , researchers have concluded that the ribs very likely evolved later in evolution than other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for escape but for temperature control or display, and although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, researchers believe that the specimen indicates that it is the feathers of an adult, not a young puff.
Although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, researchers believe that the pattern indicates that the feathers are those of an adult, not a young.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team wanted to achieve would be to create tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Roman road.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also has a powerful influence on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter on another dark matter behaves similarly to ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is held in a ring of numerous tiny particles.

In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with a marked choice in an envelope.
Once the official person has confirmed the identity of the voter, he or she shall place the envelope in the voting box and sign the electoral register.
French electoral law is quite strict about this procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope in them at the start of the election and that no envelope has been added except those submitted by duly registered and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process, and in the evening, under strict supervision, volunteers count the votes, following certain procedures.

He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Later, Adekoya was charged with the murder of his son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be unreliable, since her picture has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts operate differently and the court has ruled that the publication of photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists are on thin ice when they publish pictures of suspects and the like".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully responsible for prosecuting the case, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment further until at least the prosecution.
They revealed that the document will relate to a border dispute that Palestine wants to establish on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is considered holy in both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has requested a permanent military presence in the valley for another 10 years after the signing of the agreement, and the Palestinian Authority has only agreed to five years of such a presence.
The shooters in the additional pest control test were under the scrutiny of the guards as the test is monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc, the Sporting Shooters Association hunting programme is sponsoring the recruitment of qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of the National Park Service's Parks and Heritage Conservation Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday in the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission, as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections, proposed the early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the general anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have triggered failed elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, resulting in six fires and minor burns in four persons.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "non-hazardous".
The response from the Ministry was that Apple's delay in the report was "really regrettable".
Mariano was struck by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (on Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers replaced an elderly lady who had to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical path.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that when a child is given a hormone, it speeds up fetal lung development.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" of the plane on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also bowed to the moon.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of the second moon, as extraordinary as she was, a strong woman", said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "The Moon was as strange as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Among 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the Prime Minister of the interim government, Julia Gillard, argued that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled agree with the demand that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
On the one hand, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and on the other hand, 31 percent of those polled believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200m freestyle and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his problems made his fitness questionable.
He was not allowed to take the pain medication he needed, which is prohibited at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known on January 25.
The discovery, which was announced on Tuesday, was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by early February.
Comets could represent the source that brought water and organic matter to the earth, from which proteins can be made that enable life.
Scientists hope to find out how planets form, especially how the Earth came into being long after comets hit the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year, and last month he voted to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and nonsense".
They're predicting he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older stationary radar technology, which enables flight controllers to more accurately determine the location of the aircraft and provide more precise information to pilots.
They will not offer any additional transport and no overhead trains will stop at Wembley, parking and shuttle services are not available on the surface.
Because of the fear of lack of traffic, there is a possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors, without the support of the team.
A new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported a new species that evolved by crossing the endemic Darwin's crayfish, Geospizo fortes, with the introduced cactus crayfish, Geospizo fortes, in just two generations, although they previously thought the process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and plastered or forged or rolled into sheets.
It may be very thinly flattened and attached to other metals, and because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of chemistry, and you can make an indicator with just a little bit of cabbage juice.
The green juice changes colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value of the test chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders together and form them into a ball with your wet, clean hands.
The mucus on your palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and the formation of a crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of a sewage system were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, bathrooms were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women met in mixed societies.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down almost instantly.
Satellites have been launched into space by rockets, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To take a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a huge rocket, more than 100 feet tall.
The bicycle has completely changed the world, and one of its most notable contributions is faster and easier transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other forms of transportation.
Below them are the more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
There are also many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that feed on much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has to do to protect it from competition with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, and they live in large groups called herds.
The herd is composed of one to three related males and up to 30 females and cubs.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely related.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger is a good athlete, and he can climb (though not perfectly), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
Tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not as full and uniform as the lion's, but more cutting with its cries and screams.
The small animals that the ostrich eats are the apes, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ostrich hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that the zebras track and search for food (gas) by smell, for they can smell where they have been on the ground.
Their night vision enables them to see very well at night and to move around in a way that they cannot hear, and they prey by first blending with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, and the new population will need different traits or adaptations to cope with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it will gradually become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, the populations will be so different in appearance that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans expel from the lungs (or exhale).
Photosynthetic plants produce food from the sun and also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
The Mosazaurus was the supreme predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other Mosazaurus.
His long jaw contained more than 70 extremely sharp teeth, and he had additional teeth in the sky, so he would crush anything that crossed his path.
We don't have any exact data, but it could have had a cleft tongue, fed on turtles, big fish and other molluscs, maybe even been a cannibal.
It also attacked all creatures that stepped into the water; even giant dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurs, were not eaten.
Although their food may seem familiar to most of us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual holiday dishes, including wild boar, peacock, lizard, and a type of rodent called pollock.
Another difference was that while poor men and women sat on chairs at lunch, rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on their sides during lunch.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each god, which was supposed to represent the home of the individual god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by means of rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
They sometimes built special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats, which were part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.
The life of a Hebrew family was mostly outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled, and Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, their people, kings, customs, and history differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Forgotten, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map.
Despite the fact that there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that a large document on parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was preserved in the form of a scroll early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the mark was simply added as a mark.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south remained unconquered.
It was ruled by the "high" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had cooperated with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces occupied southern France, an invasion known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the American and French Free Forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture, a large group of individuals living and cooperating together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civic, and is cognate with the Latin words civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, which in a way also indicates the size of society.
The city-states are the forerunners of nations.The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural heritage and a considerable diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, with their provisions on confederation, first formed a weak central government. It was composed solely of congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities to enforce its laws, who were often unwilling to cooperate.
Moreover, it had no powers to annul tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The amendments required the consent of all the federal states, but the individual states did not take central authority seriously, and their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and became the 2006 World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sabre, rugby, cycling, hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern provinces, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often called an "archipel" from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed past the island called it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform the native ways of growing grain and to employ Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty military forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coasts and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which handed over control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Sun Tower, and the Sanctuary of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to make it easier for tourists to imagine what they originally looked like.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most widely used photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still used today, but more importantly, its image ratio has also taken on the image type formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format actually  and somewhat unusually  measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the most basic aspect ratio in the form of an integer) is 3:2.
Many conventional formats (ASP family of formats) are the same or very close to this ratio of height and width.
The rule of thirds, which is often exploited and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamics and at the same time provides a criterion for the arrangement of the image.
According to him, the most efficient place for the main object at the intersection would be the line dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, enriching itself and expanding its power.
For over a millennium, the Christian faith has united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and customs.
Her omnipresent power affected kings as well as common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for that very purpose.
The seat of church authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it really follows that principle.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain established a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies has proved effective, but this blockade violates generally accepted international law, codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from reaching entire ocean areas, thus endangering neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job at Edison in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (a business manager at his previous job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China represented different time periods in a distinct way; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between the individual dynasties, when the provinces were divided, the most famous of which is the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted 60 years.
During these periods, violent battles were fought between many nobles, who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with thousands dying in the struggle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, the professions were open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is also true of the military, because military tanks are now based on caliber instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed members of the working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was intensely interested in things beyond this earthly life, and he visited a cave known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists, and the interior of the cave offers complete solitude.
Except for the clear, beautiful skies above and the many surrounding mountains, there is little to see or hear from inside the cave.
Of the seven wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many larger pyramidal structures built in honor of the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
A large pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'upward' symbol looks like a V, and the 'downward' symbol looks like a button or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push it, down means you should start at the frog (so where you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The bowstroke from above usually produces a softer sound, while the bowstroke from below is stronger and more decisive.
If you wish, you can draw your own arrow marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed arrow marks are for music and should be taken into account.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young child (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by an angry mob of Branches to retreat from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows on the sidewalk.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people alone.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover most of the costs and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the break-through profits from the long-term exploitation of the Philippines would be the basic income for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which refers to the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological necessity to the idea that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic, related to scientific laws and their application in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently causes "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you might say that with the development of the automobile, the road will certainly develop.
The national road network cannot be economically justified for a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for treating injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of romance, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time customs and cultures associated with a particular geographical area emerged that were compatible with the state of society and thus superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 C.E. and lasted until 1100 C.E.
Its status declined somewhat in the 12th century as the crusaders returned home full of gifts in the form of silk and spices, worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the name of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing in the East was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture.
Because of slow communications, however, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances of the time, and the result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is a term used for farming with the aim of producing sufficient quantities of food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system, using saved seeds originating from the same ecological region, combined with rotation or other simple techniques to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they have been overlooked by social norms, and allow them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their belonging by the recognizable and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerism and argot.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their childhood because of neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Some wolf cubs were imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); this form of child abuse was in some cases the result of the parents' denial of the child's more severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or fled, wild children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma in childhood.
Others are said to have raised animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When wild children are fully raised by nonhuman animals, their behavior (within physical limitations) is almost exactly the same as that of the animal caretakers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, but it goes a step further.
It is not a learning method but rather a support tool for individuals who are learning something new, such as how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
The stage can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a stage shape, but the same is true for a little bit of a knot in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are an integral part of the software and are intended to ask questions, encourage and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, loving, and nurturing, and yet it is happening.
We think the foster system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The herd was to provide all the necessities of life that were not available in the home from which they had been previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and approach to reward.
For example, learning and socialization are thought to be important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'persistent relationships' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they studied how the public responds to a website.
The video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of micropotes, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, they say that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks explained that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century suggests that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination with each generation rearrange the variation back and forth between the two sets.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human, with plant resources available in the savannah, has difficulty satisfying its amino acid needs.
Moreover, if this need cannot be satisfied, serious consequences result: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest sources of plant protein would be the proteins found in leaves and leaves of grass, which are difficult for primates, including us, to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested but also a source of high-quality protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time and falling back to sleep soon after (10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will override you but not wake you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces the person to get up and go to the water.
The amount of inner peace an individual has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present, and each person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only obstacle to that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also includes the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations allows for the awakening of the kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment).
The central Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, where the visualization of various deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
As Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the USSR and the United States began to cooperate.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and they fought, with the help of proxy armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and relocate to the Romanian bridge.
But these plans became obsolete virtually overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army marched in and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying eastern Polish regions, which was in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of the navy has been to ensure that the state maintains the ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to bring men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy wanted to stop this kind of traffic, especially with U-boats.
If the Allied forces failed, Germany would probably succeed in taking Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds, often children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar shepherds of sheep.
In England, the railway was built as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were made up of only parallel desks, they allowed the horses to pull at higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly worse roads of the time.
Soon, they began using thresholds to keep the tires in place, but they gradually realized that the tires were more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron made wooden wheels on the wagons wear out faster.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first railways were built entirely of iron.
Walking was the first known means of transport, and people began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo Erectus appeared.
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Two-legged walking features are present in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can make our lives more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of human progress in science and technology, but overpopulation and a wasteful lifestyle have also increased problems.
After it passed Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, known as "Dunlap's Flyers".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets still exist, and they are considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, since the handwritten original has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, birds and dinosaurs share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their backs like tyrannosaurs.
So virtually all the computers we use today are based on manipulating information that's encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, these two numbers are called binary digits  or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity is not always the most obvious, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The main sign of internal poisoning is the possible presence of open packaging containing medicinal products or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if specific first aid instructions are given for this poison.
Entomologists officially use the term insect for this group of insects.
The term comes from the prehistoric affinity of the finches, highly evolved human parasites.
Both predatory lizards and finches are nesting animals adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease of younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that caring for a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take over the role of the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method, and that method actually drives most of the scientific research.
But that's not all. Testing is also an important part of scientific research, where the test is a test designed to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and observe.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical text, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek, the Western world broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often substantially dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation by means of biological clocks.
Repetitive rhythms, which are not just responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of continuous cyclic repetition even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments where they labeled the DNA in the fae with radioactive phosphorus or the fae protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary greatly, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the call cells are affected.
Only mutations in the call cells can be passed on to children, and elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including its plants and wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and the study of ecosystem information.
One example is the sightseeing, photography, and study of the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in cars to get to work, and those who work in the area they just left drive past.
In this dynamic means of transport, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the car-based transport system.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has uprooted the biosphere from one of its stable states that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
In a society where everyone is cooperating and using transportation systems, almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or the demolition of bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems that fail every day, or is it the incompetence of the transport engineers, or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour is usually fixed to some extent, so traffic flows are also fixed and can be represented in mathematical form in a rough way.
In order to better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of roads.
Beetles were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made them more adept at avoiding enemies and more efficient at finding food and mating partners.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to spread their wings along their body.
This gives them even more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings against the body are the shepherds and the unicorns.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, and many believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, which stretches for up to six miles, is also the widest river on earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical expertise of the Giza pyramids were never exceeded.
During the New Kingdom, Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
The Vatican has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
In the Vatican, Italian is the official language of legislation and communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the country's workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since all of them can be found in their original forms in nature and can be extracted quite easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
There were actually four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he claimed that they transform into new substances and form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny, you could put them in trillions at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when the pencil was invented, it was a dear friend to many.
Unfortunately, new writing methods were developed, and the pencil was pushed to the side.
People are now typing messages on computer screens and not even coming close to the spike.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will look like when something newer comes along.
The way a fission bomb works is that it takes energy to combine a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart into a slaughterhouse, and then some of that energy is released by re-injecting the core.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they usually decay on their own or almost without help.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the sea, but thicker under the high ground.
There could be more seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner, and the lava would be easier to lift to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories investigate what it is that makes some people want the things they want, and what things in the environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
When CEOs start managing their former colleagues, it is generally thought that they can start behaving in one of two ways: on the one hand, there is the effort to remain one of the boys (or girls).
Such a leader finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to administer disciplinary measures, to evaluate employee performance, to assign tasks, and to hold wrongdoers accountable.
On the other hand, we can become the unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and draw the path in his own way.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the group.
This behavior often creates a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups aim at the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are slight differences.
Virtual group members often act as a contact point for their direct physical group.
They tend to have more freedom than ordinary group members, as their groups have to adapt to multiple time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not listen to.
Another characteristic of a virtual group is the presence of a real invisible group (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
Invisible team is a management team to which individual members report. Invisible team sets standards for each member individually.
Why would an organisation undergo a delayed process of establishing an organisational learning?The transposition of organisational learning concepts into practice is aimed, among other things, at innovation.
When the working departments of an organisation make effective use of the resources available, creativity and ingenuity can be initiated.
This can create a new innovative process in the process of intra-organisation cooperation to overcome barriers and meet the needs of customers.
Before a given organisation can become innovative, management must establish an innovative environment and encourage knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) interprets the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows the field of research and significantly increases its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the theses in the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesion, and tumor affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
And so we get a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how the processes in our heads work.
Although AI has a strong science fiction appeal, it is a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves the design of machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate industries, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is embedded in many personal computer and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of any lesson, and teachers would often be happy to take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire art in the classroom.
Posting a tour report online is also a great way to think about the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and they redesign the website every year, but the old versions stay online and serve as a memorial album.
Online journals can help students improve their writing style.Although most students start writing a weblog with superficial spelling and grammar, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students can often be the most demanding audience, the blogger starts to work on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, online journaling "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to attract the attention of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Keeping a weblog is a tool to encourage students to collaborate and strive to learn even when they are not in school.
The appropriate use of online journals "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by constantly responding to online material, students can determine their position on the writings of others and shape their views on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, boasting numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
A little further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north we find the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka with its glaciers.
All of this and more puts the province of Ontario in the spotlight as something that foreigners consider typical of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some areas are almost unpopulated wilderness.
The population comparison may seem surprising to many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of its fauna and flora.
The smaller islands are mostly independent or associated with France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the area, which became strong in the Comoros and on the island of Mayotte.
The beginnings of European influence and colonization date back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: We recommend that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of the actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (but not one that looks very valuable).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can give the impression of harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to defend your position (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern-day Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used it as a strategic port under the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, then abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan sultan, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is not difficult to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan delicacies such as tagine, pottery and leather goods, water pipes, and a wide range of geegaws, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and, especially, the city center.
Although Goma is safe enough, excursions outside Goma need to be explored to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most convenient mountain gorilla tracking opportunities in Africa.
You can travel around Goma by bus (a motorized taxi).
And because it is also quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" is used as an alternative name for exotic, remote lands.
Although Timbuktu is a tourist attraction and has an airport because of its reputation, it is now a poor city.
In 1990, because of the danger of desert sand, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger.
He was one of the main hosts of the Henry Louis Gates PBS television special "Wonders of the African World".
This city is quite different from other cities in the country, because it has more Arab than African influences.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the north-east of South Africa, and stretches along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each supporting a different group of wildlife and plants.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered the show horse of South African National Parks (SANParks).
There is a daily entrance fee for the conservation and tours of the park, as in any South African national park.
It might be a bad idea to buy a Wild Card, which gives you access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong, and it is a major stop for many tourists.
They associate the type of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong with a glittering column diagram, emphasized by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Urban development in Hong Kong islands is largely concentrated in the reclaimed territory on the northern coast.
This place was taken over by the British colonists, so it's a good place to start to see the remnants of the area's colonial past, if that's what you're interested in.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges basin.
The Sundarbans cover a large area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tigers in the area.
Buses run from the inter-city bus station (across the river) all day, most of them, especially those to the east and Jakarta/Bumthang, from 6.30 to 7.30.
Because buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts offer small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and sturdy.
By using a combination of taxis, you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby towns such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to the city of Saint Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The towers are 232 feet [83 m] high, 1,378 feet [378 m] long, and have two 12 foot [3.5 m] wide aisles.
The bridge is 15 metres high and was built in August 2011 but opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are also expected to be completed.
The Guarani, who lived as nomadic hunters and self-sustaining farmers, were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, lived in the Chaco region, subsisting by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes called the "Great Indian Province", developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the Polo Grounds in Las Cañitas.
You can watch minor tournaments and matches all year round.
Tournament news and information on buying tickets for polo matches can be found at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP) and its value is determined in accordance with the value of the British pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from FIC West.
British pounds are accepted on virtually all islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are mostly accepted on Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on outlying islands, but British and American currencies may be accepted; inquire in advance of owners as to which payment method is acceptable.
Falkland currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange for cash before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo lies in the subtropical zone; summer temperatures often exceed +30 °C.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the mix of wind and humidity makes it appear colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, keep at least 100 yards/m away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/m away from all other wildlife.
Buffaloes, Canadian deer, moose, bears, and almost any large animal can attack, even if they look tame.
Dozens of visitors are harmed every year because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
Also, you should know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so do not carry or cook food with a strong smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of the Tupue Supreme Chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is spread over two harbours, there's a lot of coastline here, and the most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie along the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe to swim in, and are usually planted with New Zealand pohutukawa Christmas trees to provide shade.
The Tamaki Drive coastline is located in the port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburb of Mission Bay and St Helier's in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with good shopping options, and they're all right along the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex but pleasant and refreshing.
You can afford a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably do better on the way.
The tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is not difficult to find if you are afraid.
The short black coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino is made with a large amount of cream (not foamed milk), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
Many hikers make trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are few on the reef.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
Sea otters come to the beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally can be seen outside this time frame.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, and most shark species are afraid of humans and swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the ocean, but their original habitat is in the mouths of rivers north of Rockhampton.
By making an advance reservation, the traveller ensures that he or she will have a place to sleep when arriving at the destination of his or her choice.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement between Ryanair and Ryanair was signed on 1 January 2007 and entered into force on 1 January 2008.
They may also withhold your reservation if you need to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any adjustments and wishes should be communicated first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site and most attendees consider this to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the middle of it, you'll have to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
Although the music on the main stages may be quieter, it should be noted that music may play late into the night in some festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping spots for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, look for the cabin, for the sound of the ice-breaking creates a rather terrifying sound for the most sensitive.
Cruise services from Saint Petersburg include a stop in the city.
Playwrights usually go to great lengths to get as much time and money as possible from their guests, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
Their offerings usually include food, drink, and entertainment to entertain and keep visitors as long as possible.
In some places, alcohol is included in the price, and alcoholism affects judgment, and fortunately, good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures below the ice.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is poor, and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep you trapped.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snow carried by the wind, or by condensation or ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow are commonplace, and traffic is generally smooth throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
In everyday usage, safari is a land-based journey to see African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often close to cars and can be seen with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can see them more easily with a telescope.
A hiking safari (also called a "desert walk", "walking safari", or "hike") refers to a hike that can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some events have been held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement, you may be in a difficult position.
Cancellation rules vary, but most of the coronavirus cancellation rules from late March do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games are due to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels rent ironing boards and ironing boards if they are not already present in the room.
If you do not have a hair dryer or if you do not want to wear painted socks, you can use a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the product (which may cause it to shrink or even rust).
There are several methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you have concerns, buy water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unknown to them in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause hypersensitivity, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, emit toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of purchasing goods that are exempt from tax and excise duty in certain places.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the macedonian roads, beware of the steep, narrow paths and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are markedly lower than in previous and later parts, usually between 35 and 40 mph (5664 km/h), and strict compliance with the limits is even more important than otherwise.
But surprisingly, the cell signal here is much stronger than on many other sections of the road, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, but in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, as cooked apples are found in cakes year-round, and cherries and plums come in summer.
Most German pastries also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the favorite pastries are usually especially well-suited to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a cake that's small but rich, try something called, depending on the region, Berlin doughnuts, pancakes or doughnuts.
Curry is a herbal and spicy dish combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of this subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is a general term for a wide variety of local dishes found throughout the country's 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional labels mostly refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Japanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, with the predominant flavors that the Javanese love being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The straps support the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they can also pose a safety problem, as they can trap the rider's legs.
If the horse throws the rider off and the rider's foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse might pull it back in case of a run-off.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during the fall.
The Cochamó Valley  is Chile's premier climbing destination, with its variety of large granite walls and cliffs, known as South America's Yosemite.
The tops of the strawberries offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world continue to make new paths through its walls with endless potential.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending on snow-covered terrain with skis or a board attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity of travelers with many followers, sometimes called "trail skiers", as they plan their entire holiday around skiing at a certain location.
The concept of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking: This activity is also called turning or skiing.
Although it does not usually contain elements of these disciplines, it is similar to alpine skiing or hiking, which are performed on steep terrain and require a lot of hard-to-reach skis and shoes.
Think of the trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good weather you can cover more distance than by walking  but you will rarely reach the speed of touring skiing without a heavy backpack and paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean applying for a visa several times and stopping passport checks.

Within this area, you can cross the border without re-entering the checkpoints where you would have to show your passport.
If you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen Member State separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes antique, and some tax authorities define antique as goods that are over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical area, as in places such as North America the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Domestic crafts could be classified as antique items even if they are younger than similar series production goods.
Deer herding is an important source of income for the Sámi, and the culture in which the craft is situated is also important for other professions.
Traditionally, however, all Sami did not breed deer on a large scale, but subsisted by fishing, hunting, and the like, with deer as their main livelihood.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern industries.

The archipelago lies 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest island being King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among them are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano still serves as a stunning natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost part of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into a plateau, and then they re-form as the 300-mile-long Ellsworth Range, which is being eroded by the glacier in Minnesota.
In the northern part of the Sentinel Range is the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising 4,892 m (14,090 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone service, you may be able to help yourself only by using a satellite phone.

Usually, tuition is required to participate in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great boating destination, and the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the islands along the coast.
You don't need a yacht to go to the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national sport of Finland, with one out of every seven or eight people having a boat.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is rather rare (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most special Baltic cruises include an extended stopover in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

If you are going to the mainland only on boat excursions, you will not need a special visa (from 2009 onwards).
Some cruise brochures mention Berlin, Germany, and as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience, regardless of age or background, especially if you have never flown or have had a traumatic experience.

The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to go deep in your pocket for the privilege (or better yet, have your company do it for you).
And it's not cheap: you can usually expect to pay up to four times more for business class than for economy class and 11 times more for first class!
On direct flights from point A to point B, it is generally not sensible to seek discounts for business or first class seats either.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been shaken by ethnic strife.
