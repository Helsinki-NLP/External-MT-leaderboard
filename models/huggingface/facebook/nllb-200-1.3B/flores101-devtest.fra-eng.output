The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, could be better served by moving forward and making meaningful changes within our organization rather than revoking accreditation.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already very popular, but it provides details that fossils usually can't provide, like color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish on the top and pale or carotenoid underneath.
This discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called a rachis, but do show other characteristics unique to feathers  bearded and barbed  the researchers deduced that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display.The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists say that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample reveals feathers belonging to an adult individual, not a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experiment: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.

Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process.Votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision in the evening, according to specific procedures.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police commissioner, said the accused had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting her trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Among other subjects discussed were the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees for a period of five years.
The subjects of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first shooting campaign have been properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday installed a new provisional electoral council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to get the country on track for new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry reacted by calling it  really regrettable  that Apple postponed the report.
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau said no damage had been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or  black boxes ) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and she died on the night of the moon, a unique moment, just like her, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she rests in a better place.
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view, and wish Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extreme end of the poll, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was called into question.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain, which was prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
It is believed that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on the ground-based radar systems previously used, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and ground car parks and relay parks are not available.
Fear of lack of transportation has created the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the teams' supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have indicated that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process has been estimated to be much longer, following breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-beaked immigrant finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways.
It can be pulled from thin thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with your wet, clean hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and producing a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with a tap in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a common bath.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call from space and sends it back to Earth almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, and the biggest benefit it has brought to us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below are the more medium-sized cats that eat prey of the same size, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat smaller, more numerous prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task assigned to each cat, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herds are made up of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and cubs.
Women are usually very close to each other, their families being made up of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lion troops act like wolf packs or dogs, animals remarkably similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be cries and roars.
The ocelots are predators of small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can, and almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists say that the ocelots track and find prey by smell, sniffing their way across the ground.
They see very well in the dark because of their night vision, and they also move very stealthily, tracking their prey by blending into their surroundings before they jump on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "specification", which simply means the formation of new species. Specification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants produce food by photosynthesis using the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants, and most of our food is plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of the time, and it was afraid of nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, plus an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have been a fork-tongued animal, eating turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate food that we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including boars, peacocks, snails, and the loire, a type of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to arrange banquets together where they rested on the side while they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, to which only the priests could enter.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were open counters overlooking the street; the houses were built of stone.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland and named it after it while traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is  Scandinavian , there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words  Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776  could be seen. The text is at the bottom of the document, on the back.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (about 29 inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of fighting him.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term  civilization  is derived from the Latin word  civilis , which means civil and is related to the Latin words  civis , meaning citizen, and  civitas , meaning large city or city-state and also indicating, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government, with Congress as its sole component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it left it to the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between States.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, with the German national team, the second most titled team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up Japan, it is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an  archipelago .
The first mention of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by called it Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of native grain-producing practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still in production today, but the important thing is that its image format is inherited from the format of the photographic sensor in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, and this is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest of the integer ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is heavily abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while protecting the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being questioned.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money is there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire sea areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic provoked only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from occurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different eras; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce battles were fought between many members of the nobility who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of the 11th century.
There are many social and political implications such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
So after the Revolution, the professions were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the army, for the ranking of armies is no longer based on class but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that went beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave which became famous as Hira' on the mountain of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even though you know it exists.
Above, you can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or  necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives as well as members of his family.
The symbol  push  looks like a V and the symbol  pull  to a staple or square with the lower side missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the arrow, and the bottom means you have to start with the top (which is where your hand holds the arrow) and pull the arrow.
An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is louder and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to put your own marks on the pencil, but remember that the printed arrow marks are for musical purposes and should therefore generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were all terrified and forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of saleswomen.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people screaming and threatening the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their chariots because of the crowd.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expense and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages  period of European history running from the 11th to the 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process which goes far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology affects societies that are conditioned intrinsically rather than socially.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare field to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the Romantic theories, geography would have shaped individuals and, in time, customs and a culture would have emerged that were in harmony with the places occupied by society, and would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture, in the east.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western fashions could be trailed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for sealing clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming practiced to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, often organic, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a severe intellectual or physical disability the child suffered.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new learning method such as using a new programme or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, so a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man in Microsoft Office is one too.
The virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the family placement system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The placement in a foster family is supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and gratification.
For example,  learning  and  socialization  are considered to be major factors in promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 Personal involvement  and  continuous relationships  were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great advances in the interpretation of micro-expressions, or facial expressions, in a few milliseconds.
One claim is that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause alternating variations between the two basins with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to react has serious consequences - growth problems, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food - such as ants, termites, and eggs - is easily digested and provides a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively silent alarm clock, so that you can regain consciousness without being completely awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you're sleeping, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking a lot of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, which are known to be diuretic), forcing you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person has is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present, and each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. It is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and awakened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real fighting, through proxy armies, on battlefields in both Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to make sure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and his property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stop the trafficking.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pasture areas, often tended by shepherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar term for shepherds.
The  wagonways  were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them at higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crossing was introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they were fitted with a strip of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first iron rails were introduced.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the arrival of Homo erectus.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they usually did.
Bipedal specialization is found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate the suffering that is coming.
In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and the problems have become greater because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are known to exist are the oldest known copies of the document, and the original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, called the birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs given that they have wings and can fly.
But there's a lot about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs covered in scales and clawed, lay eggs and walk on their back legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic medicines or household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term  insect  is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Like bed bugs, bed bugs are nesting, adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their best interests - or the child's - to be involved in the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to plan for adoption for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and that method guides most scientific research.
It is not the only one, however, the experiment, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people wishing to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, we can go and see, photograph and discover the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars and supports it.
Science now shows that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and fleas.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus argued that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise - that the solar system moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main branch is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City State draws up its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholic.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, since they are found in nature in their raw form and are fairly simple to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, he was referring to the four states of matter (in the same order) - solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that these transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys which contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the advent of new writing styles has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to less frequent use.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to get close to a pencil cutter.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works on the following principle: It transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to come up to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives certain people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, drives them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues: one of the ends of the spectrum is trying to remain  the good friend  (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created up to now and do things his/her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real  invisible team  (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to take on the tedious process of creating a learning structure?One of the objectives of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can innovate, its management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus allowing the field of research to be narrowed and made much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injury, tumour and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is often strongly connoted as science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence aims at automating tasks by machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been embedded in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class, and often a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings, where students can look at ancient objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practicing an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital, and each year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills.Although students often try the blog experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to work on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging  forces students to learn more about the world around them . The need to arouse the public's interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs ""can enable students to strengthen their analytical abilities and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and present their own views on specific topics"" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and has a large number of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the region of Muskoka and its surroundings, which possess pristine natural beauty.
All these measures, and many more, make Ontario what foreigners consider Canada to be.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even the continent of its own kind, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the lands, and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Road linking Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should declare that she is married, whatever her civil status.
It is also advisable to carry a ring (which should not seem too valuable.
Women should realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider to be harassment, as it is common for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting male advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber traders in the tenth century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had destroyed it and rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and all kinds of trinkets, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma should be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility,  Timbuktu  has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, because of the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' show Wonders of the African World on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km2, and it is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which is home to a specific fauna.
It is one of the best known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to certain South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main centre of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that line the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph, reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the flatlands of the northern shore.
This is the place where the British colonists settled, so it seems to me a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this area.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps: they also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/marsh areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the Inter-District Bus Station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese cabots, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge overlooking the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oyapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two lanes of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes inhabiting the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, survived primarily by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once nicknamed  the Giant Province of the Indies , was born from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish ushered in a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a common currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On neighbouring islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and US currencies may be.
It's almost impossible to change Malvinas money outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics and summer temperatures of over 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely falling below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make it look colder than the thermometer would indicate.
There are no real rainy and dry seasons: precipitation is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must stand at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, elk, eagles, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep enough distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval deadlock in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
The Supreme Leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbours, and the most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe to swim in, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, which are often frequented by families, have many shops along the shoreline, and it is safe to swim there.
The main local beer is  Number One , a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing.
There's plenty of French wine to taste, but New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a  cream coffee  is foreign. A short black is an  espresso , the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, in the north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and they can sometimes be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and would shy away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, airport transport or even package flights and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp out on the spot, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be part of the musical event, you'll have to arrive early to find a well-placed campground.
Please note that although the musical performances are finished on the main stages, other musical performances may continue into the late night at other festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noises in the most exposed huts.
Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos generally make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers, rarely have windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in place.
However, drunkenness can impair judgment, and all good gamblers know that it is vital to remain sober.
Anyone who drives to high latitudes or mountainsides should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or dust, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is practically uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In common parlance, the term  safari  refers to a trip to the African land, and especially to the savanna, with the aim of witnessing the captivating spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment makes it possible to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, walking safari, or footing) is a hiking activity that takes place either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021 with some events being held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a iron and a plank to iron, which can be borrowed even if they are not available in the rooms.
If you don't have any irons to iron or you don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which may cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water is enough for one minute; in others, it is necessary to boil it for several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests they do not know in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or, in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some localities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh motorway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind - steep slopes, narrow roads and tight curves are the norm.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than before.
However, the mobile service is strangely much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are baked and baked all year round, while cherries and plums are the highlight of summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of coffee.
If you want small but delicious pastries, try Berlin balls, also known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either solid or liquid, depending on how much sauce is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without other qualifier, it tends to refer to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavours favored by Javanese being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddles are suspended on the sides of the saddle, and the rider's feet are supported by the saddles.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: the user's feet may get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the saddle, he could be dragged if the horse escapes.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth, fairly narrow heel and sole.
Then some saddles, especially English, have safety bars that allow a sturdy horse to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley  The top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the summits, mountaineers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the steep slopes, where the possibilities are limitless.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down a snow-covered track with skis or snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called  ski bums , who organize their entire holidays according to skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 years B.C.
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but does not generally include these activities, which are performed on rough terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions you can cover somewhat greater distances than on foot, but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on sloped slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, so in conventional circumstances, travelling through several countries requires several visa applications and several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, operates somewhat as one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the borders without going through the passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the member countries of the space separately, which saves time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of whether a manufactured object is an antique.Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The criteria vary from place to place; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Craft products may be considered antiques even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence for the Sami, and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Samis were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they made a living from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern trades.

The opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions expressed are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared with the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social upheaval or loss of human life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of many kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea thunderstorms, and cyclones.
Extreme weather events, regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the risks of bad weather in their destination area, as this may affect the itineraries they are considering.
Anyone who is considering traveling to a country that might be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An internet search for  Courses in a hostile environment  will probably give you the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons handling training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo a sex change operation abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender indicated (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.

Transsexual people in the pre-op phase should not expect to pass the scans while preserving their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are the currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a cliff or equivalent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep water can form.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're off the power, it's no harder than usual to swim back in.
It is also possible that, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for the rescue.
Reintegration shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have had difficulty adjusting to a new culture may find it very difficult to adjust to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your native culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that traveling to a new country requires adjusting.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can still hear the noise of tourists and vendors.

The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations with sixteen of them being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the caldera flooded by a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-kilometre-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, traversed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 4,892 m (14,090 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cellular network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions that have remote data transmission and telephone needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about connecting to this service.
Those who plan for a sabbath year have the opportunity to learn by traveling, and more and more of them are choosing this option.
This is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a sabbatical abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your own country.
In general, there is a fee for enrollment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for pleasure boating.  The Land of a Thousand Lakes  also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagoes.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to go on the islands and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but other than that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is from one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only come ashore on cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some cruise brochures.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea at all and no visits to this city are included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no shame in it: it is no different from the personal fears and apprehensions that many people feel about other things.
For some, understanding something about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help them overcome a fear of the unknown or of not being in control.
Freight companies are well paid for delivering goods quickly, and often in the context of urgent repairs, the question of time is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts involved.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and for small companies, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air, on some routes, it would have taken days to get through unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better yet, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no need to seek discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passenger who is willing to pay a high price for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares with knowledge.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan only, as the law establishes that this is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.

The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mostly with beech, spice and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The region is also home to a great variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat, and the great tetras can be seen there, as well as many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and shoulders equally.
Most monasteries give stars to women who arrive with nothing, but if you bring your own, and it's also brightly colored, you'll be entitled to a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Just like men should wear pants that cover their knees.
We can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it's not washed after every use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.

However, those who speak some Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to it that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their day was not as much of a concern as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.

Many traditions related to these holidays have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is customary to spend the night of Easter awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that have arrived on these islands have done so originally by water, by swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, the mammals could not complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the principal grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you may experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good time to admire the Northern Lights, as the sky will be almost dark all day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are the usual work clothes, and the workers are called by their surnames or by their jobs.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasises collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval for any decision they make and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
