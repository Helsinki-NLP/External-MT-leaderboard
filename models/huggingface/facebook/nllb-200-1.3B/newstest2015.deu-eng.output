The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tōkyō on his first major overseas visit since winning the May election to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day visit to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after speeding motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bush land to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report the driver then ignored stop signs and continued on Burgess Road before turning off into the bush, where officers lost sight of him.
The motorcycle and a person matching the description of the driver were later seen near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of failing to stop at a stop sign and reckless driving.
He is to appear before the Karratha District Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged with the Naim and Pitlochry hotel rapes
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was arraigned at a hearing of the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The indictment alleges that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent".
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Highlands, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
The Court of First Instance has decided that the Court of First Instance should be heard on the basis of the Court's decision.
A return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
"As unions die, so do middle-class jobs", said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
So I'm proud to join with civil rights icon John Lewis in introducing the Employee Empowerment Act.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the event of discrimination on the grounds of trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The supplement to national labour law to provide a means for workers subject to discrimination to organise a trade union representation to sue in civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks faced by unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time, millions of Americans still remember, when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to unionize in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in the creation of a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unite and to negotiate and act together are guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would have to organize and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or trade.
Agreements which restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide treaty in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country was advising other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and then to allow that union to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with business and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights have come under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal that the working people must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living for millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops a law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the implementation of a Louisiana law that lawyers say would have likely led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, signed into law by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and scheduled to take effect on September 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient admission license at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while they seek such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they pursue these rights", wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision on the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the ruling, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it would buy doctors more time to get hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a treacherous law that seeks to take away their health and their rights", said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the suit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have forced the closure of most of the state's remaining clinics were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that doctors' authority requires unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient access, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would not perform the operation for his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their requests for patient rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of ovarian cancer deaths in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent survived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Smaller study: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the women's medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, preexisting conditions, and social and economic status also affected her chances of survival.
The lowest survival rates were for older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities", she said.
Despite improvements in telemedicine services to counter some of the distances, she suggested as a possible remedy an increase in in-patient services to enable specialists to provide care to women closer to their homes, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study found poor long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographic status, and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres lament falling homeownership numbers
The decline, coupled with a sharp decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could mean that garden centres could lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "core group for garden products", according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that renters spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their gardens.
The rise in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular practice of paving front gardens for park purposes and the decline in garden size are further factors threatening the industry, which is estimated to be worth £5 billion a year in sales.
Greater London, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of six years, has the lowest expenditure on garden products per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting a house or having small gardens doesn't mean people can't grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardening, for example, is very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when they move".
The HTA report identified the period from 1997 to 2005 as the 'golden age' of the garden retail sector due to rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improvement in the market situation for this year due to the improved weather following unfavourable weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed the state-run PTV channel.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers were able to push the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station suspended operations for about 40 minutes but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they clashed with security forces armed with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
Meanwhile, the country's army urges a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using violence".
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays a major role in Pakistan and has already staged several coups.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most senior US diplomats to investigate a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US Embassy's business representative and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the data from former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the report's importance, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that the main German intelligence service was also targeting Ankara caused much more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Train drivers threaten to strike commuters
The nationwide warning strike of train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The suspension announced for 6 to 9 p.m. concerns all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and subway transport,
The main focus of the strike is on freight transport.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of dangerous substances.
We expect significant downtime.
There are no regional priorities.
The main target of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in North Rhine-Westphalia announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it was going to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence Friday to the Mallorca prosecutor's office of extortion by police and Calvià city officials.
The police chief of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious binge-drinking hotspot of Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested on corruption charges by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city officials to the office of the Prosecutor General for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said the co-operation of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving", one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihoods out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer with a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist engaging in fellatio with 24 men during a drunken tour.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the illegal behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious drunken pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellowship incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub-tour operator Carnage are jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol, including the "balconing" trend, where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affecting flights from Adelaide Airport
SUNDAY has been a winter surprise for South Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds disrupting flights from Adelaide Airport.
By 21h, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm that had already fallen on the night of Sunday.
The latest rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a downpour that began just before 8 p.m. and produced nearly 4 millimeters of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week brought an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again to a high of just 15.8 degrees on Monday.
The inclement weather conditions have probably caused the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a gust of wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off again on a second landing and finally took off at about 8:40 p.m.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is forecast to reach a high of 16 degrees on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says it's time for a big network
In the face of rapid technological progress that threatens to turn our comfortable homes into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies offers a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, I look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a reason for this: If there were no cable, in no time at all would all the listeners be flying around the house, and that would be even more retro.
The same applies to electronic (electronic)
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world innovation of today is the electrical waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if you have a tube TV in your living room today, for example, you are simply saying that you are fundamentally opposed to television.
Why such considerations?
Because the IFA's pushing on the radio tower this week is another reminder of our absolute incompetence in electronics.
The layman who used to blindly control the washing machine and the CD player now does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with incomprehensibly empty expertise: "Connected home, wearables, health care and urban technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, can we?
What are you going to talk to people who seem to be willing to spread this kind of quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it's been about connecting our homes.
So the yogurt can reorder itself, so the fire alarm on vacation in the Maldives can tell us it's burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get the air conditioning out of the office on our soon arrival...?
Yeah, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream is sure to come true soon: We pick up our watch, say "suck!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner robot starts.
You're out of your mind.
It's all about nothing less than a revolution: "The lines between white and brown goods are blurred", says an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to a headset, the steam-generator sends the weather report, and the data glasses tell you how long the pizza will be in the oven, which is useless because we're stuck in traffic.
We also know from daily practice that if a new-fashioned device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters as rocket and mortar shelling fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and anticipation to the communities in southern Israel that were hit by rocket-propelled grenades, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but excited", said Ronit Bart, a local resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children in our area are in dire need of a return to a routine.
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"Those were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that has been badly hit by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security".
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demands for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war has killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel denies this and estimates that at least half of those killed were fighters, but has not provided any concrete evidence to support this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
During this time, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other strikes.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that have been converted into temporary shelters.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children of the world and the Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After elections in Saxony: CDU deputy Strobl questions NPD ban
In the face of the NPD's vote losses in Saxony, CDU Vice-President Thomas Strobl has spoken in favour of ending the NPD's ongoing ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should be terminated.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time", Strobl, who is also the CDU state leader in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and one which leads me to conclude that the NPD is being fought politically and not in the Constitutional Court.
The NPD narrowly missed the five-percent threshold in Sunday's vote.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003 because the protection of the Constitution had informants at the top of the NPD.
In December 2013, after a long period of preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application to Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Camps for new refugees
Refugees are now housed in tents at Neulanderplatz.
The Central Refugee Board in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Interior Department has three Red Cross tents set up next to it.
The district politicians were informed just a short time before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These hawkish actions continue to fuel citizens' reservations and prevent district politicians from contributing constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees", says Britta Herrmann, chair of the Greens' group in the Harburg district assembly.
Your party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide currently unused houses for housing.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first-aid unit are the influx of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the normal three months.
House prices have risen the most in seven years, according to a widely-observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday's RP data.
This increase brings the total increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne were driving a market split.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices rose by just 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the start of spring, there would now be an increase in property for sale for the next few months, which would put the market "on a real test".
"Given the continuing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months", he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of the CEO Peer Medau and attests to him posing "like a general".
The communication states that this is not the style of the university.
The Medau family had already been "orally informed of the university's plans in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely false", said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not 'determinations or even decisions', but 'preferences'.
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle, which was necessary for access, was also less dramatic than the fears of the Medes.
There was and is no talk of a nine-meter-wide road.
It is 5.50 metres wide at present, which is one metre wider than it has been so far", explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that their free parking space will only be used by university students in the future.
The problem is that the train is not parked at all, because it can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the locals
The kindergarten Bergwichtel, which is located on the grounds and whose front door would lead along the access to the parking deck, is to be "not affected", according to the university president.
He also points out that "this is not just about the nursery, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring Realschule.
So it is much more than Mr Medau's particular interests", says Pötzl.
Whether the parental advisory board's criticism of the nursery that the road expansion would "lose one of the few remaining natural spots of Coburg" is justified "may the reader decide for himself".
In early October, Pötzl and the State Building Office Bamberg will inform the city councils about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university.
The new parking deck will not be accessible via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but via the Medau-Berg.
This would require a two-lane extension of the narrow road, which is about a kilometer long.
According to the calculations of the Medes, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would increase tenfold.
We are talking about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city has so far refused to comment on the project.
Glandorf retires from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems as the main reason for this decision.
I have not taken the decision lightly, it has been several months in the making.
It's time for me to listen to my body's signals and end my career in the national team", the 2007 world champion posted on his Facebook page.
He retired from international football with a record of 167 caps and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the giant back for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on a hunting trip for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
The Icelandic, who will announce his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, was the subject of a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approach have inspired me as they will inspire my longtime colleagues and my successors.
But I want to be healthy for my club in the next few years, which requires longer periods of recovery, which the current double-loading does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear the end of his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later caused severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other procedures followed.
Then Glandorf filed a lawsuit against the team doctor, and the argument ended in a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career don't pass without a body.
I have some health construction sites I can't ignore anymore.
After three operations on my feet in 2012 that were short-term, I never managed my blood pressure properly.
In addition to these, there are a number of other wear complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I realized that I could control my head, but I couldn't fool my body", Glandorf told Handball Time magazine.
He'd only be ready for a comeback in the most extreme case.
"When things get out of hand, I'm always open to conversation", the father of two told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I'd like to be able to walk upright.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League victory, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrinks 0.2% in spring
The crises around the world have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0,2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office, confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring, while investment fell.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
The strong start to the year has led to a 0.8% increase in GDP for the first half of the year compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the Münsterland-Mooiste, which passed through the town of Burgmann for the first time on Sunday.
The town of Horstmar was invaded by Dutch "pipe-riders" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, the NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour in the whole of Münsterland, the cyclists' paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Joster Huerne for organising this tour of Münsterland by registering for the event.
This tour was offered to interested persons by means of advertisements in various magazines.
We're from Den Helder and we drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland in this way too", the cyclists were delighted about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration at the clubhouse of the Brotherhood of Shooters Sta.
Katharina went on a little "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the launch took place.
The route, which had been advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz, passing through the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and returning to Horstmar via Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On 95 kilometers (1,175 feet), 120 kilometers (1,475 feet), and 145 kilometers (1,775 feet), the cyclists proved their fitness.
They were fed on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organiser Joster Huerne and the deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a good experience for all involved.
The organisation went without any problems and there were no negative incidents", Heinz Lölfing sums up the event positively.
Unfortunately, the organisers did not expect as many participants, probably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 with hopefully good weather on August 30 or during another weekend", but the cyclists promised nevertheless to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
The ruthlessly honest memoirs of Konstantin Wecker
It's actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-convict, put on paper in "Monk and Warrior" in 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fragments for thought fragments, the Munich born on June 1, 1947 has written down his memoirs, each chapter started with a suitable song lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From high school masturbation to shoplifting and drug use, he does not ignore human weaknesses.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also includes abstract but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom of, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political involvement - and also how he was not only influenced by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his time in prison.
The latter has also brought the life-man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who is created "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out all that is unnecessary".
But among all the supernatural views, there are also brief anecdotes about the Earth: like a fight in a G.I. frequented place or a crazy car ride where he aimed his head at a tree.
He's also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was adapted from the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is pondering his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get out of here!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already grown when I was a child, would take him to the pub and talk about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket kick.
I never had a conversation like that with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner, reading the paper.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he had gained a glimpse of what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep, stegy labyrinths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly start singing because he could wash the foundry off himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he'd been doing this for years to get the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Yet, Henry grew up without any love-proclamation from his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
It wasn't until my mother was in a bad way toward the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Would you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me, will you?
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He's still friends with French, who he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it is exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he's been taken over by the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started when he was just 16, working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage imitating people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for quite a long time".
He learned by trade.
I had to not only grow up in the public eye, but from 1975 to 1985, I had to learn how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really hard.
Lenny 1975 with New Faces
As his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with a large audience.
But this "decades-long award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known for his role as Chef Gareth Blacklock on the sitcom Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just passing the time or stepping in a little bit".
This was followed by a Radio 4 documentary series entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned anything about him in school, and I thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in stockings and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally put my head back up.
"So, this is serious, take it seriously, study your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read that piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he was in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theater and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed".
There was a technical glitch and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, 'You'll have to wait 10 minutes while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would resume once the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me was like, "Oh, thank God".
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You're in a play, so stay in your role".
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lyrics for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That was also well received, so it's like a big sign from the gods telling me, "This is your destiny".
He says this, of course, in a thunderous voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the mind of a comedian - our conversation is filled with humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I think that kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
If you're always looking for that, you're going to hit a wall with it.
I sometimes play live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall, I don't get as much as I used to.
I ask him if he's ever gonna do another stand-up comedy tour.
The fun I get in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle and the end of a journey -- I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I like stories.
People like stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in the Yemeni capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
The access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
The Houthis threatened further escalation of the conflict if their demands were not met, according to the newspaper.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the government's resignation.
The Houthis have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps along the main roads to Sana'a.
In the surrounding area, bloody fighting with the Yemeni army is repeated.
Kenya registers officials to contain 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all government employees in order to remove "spirit employees" from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will not be paid, a government announcement said.
The government believes that thousands of people will continue to receive salaries after they leave the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost in "ghost employee" payments and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid out to accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure their data is being recorded through biometric records, a government message said.
Anyone who did not do so without a credible excuse would be struck off the payroll, the message continued.
"This will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and also by adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'ghost employees'", said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard for the first time in court on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are seeking EUR 19.4 million in civil proceedings at the Düsseldorf District Court for damages from Achenbach and two of its companies, which are in insolvency proceedings.
A court spokeswoman said Monday.
The complaint alleges that Achenbach was fraudulent in the purchase of works of art and antiques and that Berthold Albrecht charged higher purchase prices than were actually paid.
This also increased the agreed commission.
Achenbach had bought 121 million euros worth of valuables for Albrecht.
Children Need Roots and Wings
He spent 44 years in the school service, 23 of them as a school principal.
Manfred Richter knows many of the most famous Petershauseners and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always driven by his desire to see the human in the student.
The Snowcapped is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, now Trutnov.
At the age of 14, after four years of high school, he became interested in teaching.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, in 1946 we went to Bavaria - in a freight wagon.
This is how Richter came to the Upper Frankish village of Senkend.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, walk three kilometers across the city to school, and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg, together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954 the second state examination after three years of teaching.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service room" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach and five in Petershausen in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association.
From the academic year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in the present-day town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
To avoid a relegation to the now smaller school, the then-rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to take over the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter retired.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who built an additional workshop and basements at the expansion in 1997 at municipal expense, although this was not eligible for funding under the school building guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly", Richter recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who responded to a school board's paper on law and justice: "Love must never be forgotten". Manfred Richter put into practice what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings", says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work". Whether he meant his students or his own six children, it's not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students fought, he did not give them any punishment or suspend them.
At the expense of the community, Judge had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two contenders compete against each other, even if there was a fuss.
For the sake of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with then-mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as rector.
This prompted the non-partisan judge to run for city council in 1996, at least as the last candidate on the CSU list, after his retirement.
But Richter was elected sixth and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stops at the spa in Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists rest in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten on their tour, it's not a big deal.
On Friday, however, the number of Rastenden alone made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour, together with the accompanying tross, enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Scottish Alteburgpark.
The theme of the event was "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig". On Thursday, the participants met in Bad Vilbel to witness a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, the cyclists started the first stage, the 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had taken part in the cycling race in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 plates of apple, twetschen, strudel and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the skilled cyclists.
"Only country women can bake such cakes", said one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments were available at the gymnastics club Geiss-Nidda's drinking booth.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the audience with familiar melodies from operettas and musicals and won enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
One man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already reattached broken bicycle chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the drinking establishment and took the opportunity to advertise Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Even promotion manager Tobias Hagen, who has been leading the Tour since the first round of the 2004 Tour, could only take a breath, as he had a lot to do with the local technology.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his staff and the 15-member motorcycle squad of the Hessen police by means of three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook posts and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region", he said, "but there are also cyclists from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants varies somewhat according to the available overnight accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in group accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression from the spa when they left after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotts, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (STS), the park had been given a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, delicacies such as flamenco cakes with well-cooled foam white were prepared.
The visitors were welcomed by Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as a member of the Board of Directors of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three were visibly delighted with the "great work in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then cleared the dance floor.
The opportunity for vigorous outdoor movement was eagerly taken advantage of despite the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens, who were as moved by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the cyclists were scheduled to visit the Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb stations, including a concert with the Trenkwalders.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media outlets report.
The police authorities did not immediately comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly forming an organized crime syndicate and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Gülen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine are returning to school
Schools in almost all parts of Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, headmaster of the school in Slavjansk, which visits the daughter of Yatsenyuk, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in later life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She's coming in with a proud dash of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own experience.
She began her career at the global management consultancy firm Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of Pearson's.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top job at Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Her settlement was said to be almost £1 million.
Their political standing is solid, too.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory councillor.
As early as May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two ways: from within the first-guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also from outside as a voice of public concern and unease when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly which demands a complete and comprehensive reform.
But what incoming chairman would risk running, going all out and tearing apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while possibly losing his job himself in the process?
It's a difficult task.
And if that's not enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC diminished - power, money and status outdated.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable safeguards, the forthcoming negotiation of the BBC's royalties carries particular risks.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC has a great story: they say they reach 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is climbing back up the popularity scale, with 53 percent supporting it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The way we watch and use the BBC has changed: I now get the headlines on my phone and watch the shows I missed later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a much-loved and highly regarded institution.
She needs a great chairman - I hope she's found one.
Perry of Texas says the derogatory tweet was unauthorized
A tweet from the official account of Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another from Perry's account, which disputes the previous one.
A tweet just came from my account that I didn't authorize.
"I don't approve of the tweet and deleted it", the message said.
Perry staff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets originated from Perry's official user account, it was unclear who actually operated the feed.
The earlier tweet featured an unfavorable image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding for her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - who could be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with triple the legal alcohol level... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry if he talks it out".
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office wasn't in charge of the grand jury investigation into Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His high-profile team of legal aides petitioned the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charges, arguing that the law against the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally vague.
Perry turned over $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigates cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto led to a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential bid, Perry responded to speculation that he would quit by tweeting a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market back to normal
One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had "returned to normal".
The capital's homes were in high demand and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set mortgage limits in June because of widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-end construction firm Berkeley, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013", adding that this provides a "stable environment for action".
The London housing market was in good shape during the downturn, as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
According to the Cadastral Office, prices in the urban area alone rose sharply by 18.5 per cent last year, far exceeding the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices for Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villain tax" ahead of the general election in May.
London-based real estate brokerage Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which introduced tighter lending rules, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the housing market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for London property price growth for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, with the amounts due for forward sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: 'Demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations has remained stable and as a result, on-time sales have also remained stable.'
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40 per cent to £280 million, the turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that Berkeley's revenue for the current year was expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax result is £450 million.
Berkeley shares were trading at £23.96 in London this afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence released by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performing at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.
A representative for the "Panem Tribute" star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were authentic and charged the hacker with "blatant violation of privacy".
Authorities have been notified and will pursue anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a loophole in Apple's online storage system iCloud, and the alleged "master list" of victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World", also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you looking at photos my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home - I hope you're really happy with yourselves", Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickelodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were of her, however, and tweeted, "These so-called nude pictures of me are LOVED, people.
Let's get right to the point.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, they dissolved slowly like a cardboard box left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, too strenuous, too intense, too distant, and maybe a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratch.
He was spiky, like a hedgehog, yeah.
The final victim of this thornyness was a newly begun affair, which had been more promising than usual for relieving the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps even bringing him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling, tender beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island even more remote and harsh than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited a plot of land in a moist but paradise-like valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, the baths were still full of spiders, snails had left their tracks on all the windows, thinking they owned it all, and the garden was covered with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house in a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn had sat hand in hand on the broken loungers in the tall grass, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon, and had been absent-mindedly glued to the service console that was supplying the country with soothing music and soothing messages, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer that his father had enjoyed listening to in the closed arcades of the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden -- nothing was really forbidden -- just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, as has the word obsolete.
The general taste did what the laws and regulations never could, and just as people choose the books from the dishwasher to the millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads for the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailinn's big feet in a crude-comical serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he explained, automatically placing two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father used to do to stop the letter J from coming out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was a little boy.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew this was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of one.
Jazz, even if not outright banned, was not played.
Improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a tune where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the musical expression of mind.
Although he had grown to 10 years old without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or compulsions.
A conformist society meant that every element of that society gratefully agreed with the principle of group talent -- grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were temperamentally and physiologically apt for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were, as it were, endowed by nature with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a working telephone exchange.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those in the Gulf and the Levant whose grandparents hadn't left the country as quickly as what happened -- for fear of being accused of arson, even for fear that the flames would consume them next -- had opened Labneh and Shisha pipe restaurants, were concerned and became depressed by inaction.
Each according to his ability.
Having heard only ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be sung.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the delusional sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers on his lips in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him", he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern's view.
There was nothing to see in the whole world but her uncompressed black-rabbit hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so", she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet so straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too soon.
"Your fat ankles are exactly why I like you", he tried instead.
I'm a little bit of a pervert.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel, too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from her couch, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Hollow blossom wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in a storm.
"And your big head is exactly why I'm pervertedly attracted to you", she said...
Except I'm not at all.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge, icy ocean broke here and there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more grim about what had happened than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from bar to bar, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused them or laughed at them.
What are you, a big head?
They would have given her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They kiss first -- kiss was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console -- they kiss first and then hit.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the punching itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got up from the couch like an old man.
She also felt a bit of a crush, but the intensity of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him as he walked away - as her companion watched from an upstairs room - a man, complaining of something he had conjured up himself.
Adam is leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bowed, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time she had seen anything like it before this day?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just described, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working for Ofnow, the non-legislative public opinion watchdog, gave a short talk on the continuing violence at low and medium levels in precisely those parts of the country where its reduction, if not elimination, is most likely to be expected, given the money and energy invested in eradicating it.
"Much has been done, and much more must be done", she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been seldom felt, despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some features turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The population weep at the sound of sentimental ballads, intoxicate themselves with stories of overcome difficulties, and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former cruelty hold the rural communities and our urban fabric in its grip, but there is evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious quarrel at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate", her mentor said after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that", replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and to refuse to testify.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I'm not asking", said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I'm against atheism, or lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a non-judgmental workplace.
We serve a society free of prejudice.
But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and laudable, can sometimes distort results as you've presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you call "subtle" and "rough" could be interpreted by others as just as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to go on about WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, you are taking away the vital life force of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED sign in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country for the past quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I totally understand what you're getting at", Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, when she was sure her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I'm not saying anything other than that we're not as healed as we pretend we are.
My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED.
But this time, it's not the others we're letting our anger and distrust out on.
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with his hands.
To show the patience of an angel.
"You're going too far", he said, "by calling actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have made.
You're also going too far when you say that they've left out their "anger" and their "suspicion" of "others".
It shouldn't be necessary to remind someone in your position that we're talking about understanding the past as well as protecting the present, not "us" and "others".
There was no "us" and there was no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves", Esme ventured, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it's done badly or well, what's done is done.
That was then.
We have no need to say anything more - we agree.
And just as no debt needs to be assigned, so no debt needs to be forgiven if such forgiveness is appropriate and if there is a way to forgive it.
But what good is the past if we don't learn from it?
The past is for us to forget.
If I may say something about that ...
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramid collapse.
"I'll consider your report", he said, dismissing her.
The next day, as she was going to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist, who, as bystanders described, had been driving down the road in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; PM stays in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were targeting police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, announcing that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after he reported terrorist threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" who were about to be armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Lesotho Defence Forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements within the police were actually arming some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage", he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action gave the impression of a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have taken over the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces so far show signs of a coup d'état", he said.
A spokesman for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that soldiers were retreating to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is taking over the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he was targeted because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, tensions have been high since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions over clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite other allegations.
Production in the euro area at 13-month low
The growth in output in the euro area slowed in August to its lowest point in 13 months, according to a closely monitored study.
The final Markit Procurement Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, from 51.8 in July.
A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders were down and factories were experiencing breakdowns at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are due to be published before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a faltering recovery in the euro area and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, may give further details later this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the euro area, similar to those taken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the disruptive effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more pronounced for manufacturers", said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a worrying example, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Signs that growth incentives in the key industries mechanism in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are no longer working are also not reassuring,' said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
The positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index is that the sector continues to grow after that".
He added: 'It is obvious that life is quite difficult for producers in the euro area at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - are adding to uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, consumer confidence - and are likely to lead to delays or even cancellations in some orders, particularly large orders.
He said that it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to introduce some form of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited".
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children trapped there still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evils.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
We found surprising young people who overcame resistance, even though the memory of that terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your best hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - will now end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the school's demolished gymnasium
She was photographed and made famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as she tried to climb back into the school's demolished gymnasium in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't", Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely cured, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
Some shrapnel's still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people like she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me", she says strenuously.
"This is what happened to me, and you can't change it.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed behind.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says the siege will always be a part of her, although the memory fades with each passing year.
I'm glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see this picture of me climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people are seeing it for the first time, understanding our disaster, and helping to make sure that it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand".
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing that she might be dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who was outside holding his son in his arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In reality, Tamara had stumbled out and was in the hospital with leg injuries, believing that her son had died.
After being reunited, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-disbanded newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering", he said yesterday.
But I can tell you it's getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We'll say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store where I could pick out anything I wanted, and the ride in an open carriage upstairs.
But now he's afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars are causing the kind of misery that he and his friends suffered.
That horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer the atrocities", said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer at a monastery.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were no children to call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember how Damir liked to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot them with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think that this world hasn't gotten any better in the last 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for many people, war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir has grown up to be a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek vengeance, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class, and they go to the gym occasionally and light candles.
When he was little, he suffered from it -- I remember sometimes he would lie on the couch, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, and Damir is now 17 years old, taller than me, handsome, intelligent, and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got back on my feet, I looked around and saw hell all around me, body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't have survived in that hell.
"I remember yelling at him, 'Damir, run, run,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgi Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of Beslan's atrocities after the siege
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His blood-stained face was marked by fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and my little boy was left there alone for three terrible days", she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer that date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days still haunt me.
No one will ever forget this, I promise you.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that day Georgij was so eager to go to school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there's even this statue of weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden in our bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world feel our pain because of this picture.
Today, Georgij says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies over and over again and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of that Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is turning into something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing in this kind of pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
Later, in 2004, I went back to school and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated this year and I'm going to a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an army training.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
Georgy Fanyyev, 20 years old
The boy who survived being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gymnasium, sitting next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it was yesterday", says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer but could not because of his health problems due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
Now that I'm older, people say that kids can handle bad experiences easily -- I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 -- the year after that -- was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I'm never going back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in that famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on his laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk fine now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent in my medical records, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about it and, of course, they should not suffer it.
His 42-year-old mother, Marina, said: "I never get over the pain.
He's in my soul, getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'm going to the memorial celebrations.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be a lot more intense for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that it was returned to me.
It stays with us.
Georgij is an adult now, but that horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a kid, he likes sports, but he can't compete because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he doesn't play sports.
I'd say he's overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will haunt us forever.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only adds to my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and it's the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know of families with new children, but I also know of widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even when you don't want it to.
I'll never forget how my heart leapt when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we be fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure that in Ukraine many children have been killed and many more will be killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskayeva, aged 10 years
The baby so touchingly carried to safety by a special operations team
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is being taken to safety by a Russian special operations team (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory of the atrocities
The world was stunned in 2004 when baby Aljona was carried from Beslan's siege in the arms of a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they held their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and their brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, has no memory of the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up on the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you'd like to take photos or videos underwater, there's a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available for under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes to optimise exposure time for dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check how deep your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Do multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that you can compose images with, action cameras don't usually.
Even if you have an LCD, it's difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you're doing a lot of recording.
If your camera has a series mode that allows you to take a series of shots with slightly changed lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you get from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you're shooting in a pool, a lake, or the ocean.
It also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.
Get close to the objects.
This is good advice on land, too, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting.
This is especially important when you're working with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your objects if you want them to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose character made a difference, even in an organisation as gigantic as the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to saving the patient both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are concerned with diagnoses and diseases, while patients are concerned with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was he whose journey of suffering began.
"I didn't feel", he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting myself together.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I'd rather have it all now than later", he noted.
When Juliet was away on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusually and unreasonably worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-rays were in.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest wall, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact cause is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been former smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, asbestos exposure is the trigger - contact with the fibrous material, once considered a "miracle substance" but now recognized as lethal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily pledged to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hardly to be a cause for concern today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
The UK is now experiencing the height of a mesothelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, it kills twice as many people as traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we're seeing the lethal effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999) is because mesothelioma doesn't develop until decades later.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and is, often in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And so mesothelioma has no class, no financial limitations, no occupations, and no age.
The privileged bastions, from the fancy department stores of London to private schools, are no safe haven.
The Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even hospitals, where we are supposed to be cured, have been chosen as the starting point for this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
He found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It appears that there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years", he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and janitors use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one alive".
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still get sick?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to end in Britain, a total of 90,000 people will have died from the disease.
Most of them don't know they're going to die like this.
A mine of asbestos in Quebec, Canada
A brief look at the court records, to which the victims often turn for damages, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had been negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in their 20s.
"Before this", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are very few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestos-form", a description of the fiber structure that makes the material resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It's been used for roofing, floorboards, pipe insulation, boilerplate, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a 'major health risk' with a potential lethal outcome.
However, brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocodilium) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high rates of mesothelioma".
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the subjects showing that 'a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure through work or home were probably caused by asbestos exposure in the environment'.
He said that much of this contact is based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It seems that no one can assume that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which studied the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, may have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of looking out for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been awarded a 'clean health certificate', it is now undeniable that £1 billion of work over several years will have to be done to renovate the Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs will be meeting at the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also noted that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant regulations".
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never determine the exact exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that had a positive decision on asbestos cases", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he remembers most clearly is the day in early December of 2009 when he got this kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was just doing a late-night surgery.
Suddenly I was shivering.
It came out of nowhere.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleural catheters to extract fluid from his lungs and test it in the lab.
His symptoms, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his work.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient of Abbott's came into his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott didn't connect this to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between the rib cage and the sternum.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going", he says.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't that worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came back in the week between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma is now in the hands of the medical community.
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended that he hire a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos", he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who haven't worked in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably less likely to be exposed to the substance.
But many workers who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (as Andrew Lawson did) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients but life-threatening for the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
Students set their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had their first exposure to asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemistry classes, students have set their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently discussed on websites.
And meanwhile, such harmless items in our homes as floorboards or shed roofs have become standard asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's in large parts of our real estate", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden sheds.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
The greatest difficulty was changing the perspective from that of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to absorb all of this", he says.
I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it.
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it's our life-support mechanism -- the breathing itself -- that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos exposure.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is stirred and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle into the chest wall, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is with the inhaled needle-like fibers of asbestos", says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed by the respiratory system to the edge where the skin is.
It's invasive by nature from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers don't work so well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some say it's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut the peel out", he says.
You can't get around that with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy", which "shows an effect", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors", says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow sufferers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center", he introduced himself happily when he got the call.
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He had been diagnosed four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, lasting four months, which were expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I was about to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "put things in a slightly more positive light".
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiac-thoracic specialist at Guy's.
"We had the advantage of not having to be sent away, I just called and got an appointment", admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to get a referral and wait for treatment approval.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to access the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers face another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be extremely hazardous to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was the realization that even very low exposure was a health risk.
And this is where corporate negligence started to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation", as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute fatal asbestos exposure to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance records can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that time is on their side, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, significant new legislation was introduced this year to make it easier for people with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer available.
The Act has set up a £350 million fund, supported by the insurance industry, for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court would have awarded them in a normal damages proceeding - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" by the insurance industry.
"This is an insurance deal for insurance", he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that with seven deaths a day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today", Penning said during the second hearing of the mesothelioma bill last December.
At this point, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he, unlike Tom Treasure, expects a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can give Lang-Lazdunski a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing", says Abbott.
You see that in patients all the time.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had the surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Post-mortem scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of the tumors.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about money when I'm gone, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.
When you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
Being the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I was first diagnosed, I told my daughter that I had a disease that I would not grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and unruly.
She told her friends, and we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Conversations like this are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not filled with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as it did in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to elect government, protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday, despite increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by Hong Kong voters.
This action is likely to fuel the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong's business district, with activists planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry", said legal expert Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain handed Hong Kong back to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the people elect the head of government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a nominating committee closely controlled by Beijing.
A new clause also states that only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have taken place for several years.
The pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is being led by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
Within hours of the announcement on Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the rally, organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned to stage protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has considered occupying the Central District only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other option.
We regret to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days for Beijing's announcement, and increased security measures were in place outside the government building on Sunday, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is being compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values of democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central demonstrations as endangering business operations - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they last", said legal expert Regine Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We don't want to create any fear that Hong Kong is going to get out of hand.
That's a bad impression for investments.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong's democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
That summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations for democracy in the region's history.
The tradition of prom in the United States is now being transferred to universities, where freshmen are offered performances on private jets.
We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service in Britain for today's students.
To make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that this year students reach university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said that no new bookings are available as the service has just been introduced, but added that "students will book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also indicated that it expected a market for this offer despite the £9,000 per year tuition fees.
Students today have very different expectations and demands from those of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being abused.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice President for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems to be completely disconnected from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting this month are facing a cost of living crisis as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the skyrocketing bills for the most basic necessities of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student hostel.
Feminists criticize race and police behaviour in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot", as they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online discussions among white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But as tensions in the Midwest mounted and gained national attention, Perez saw that the responses from white women were 100 percent about race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9th shootings, the personal essays with titles like "Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About the Oppression of Women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, it was a major change.
"I don't think you'll find many people in feminism who are above white and talk privilege in such a classy way", she said.
People felt compelled to express themselves about the events.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically diverse that they have to express it.
For Koritha Mitchell, professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women face every day, but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can post something funny about me and my partner on Facebook and get 150 likes from everywhere", Mitchell said.
When I post about how black people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk about a relationship in public but not about safety in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women haven't had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women are now blending issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman", Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the divide between white and black women reached a point where white women's suffrage activists like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 1800s and found that the fight for suffrage could only succeed for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to fight for women's suffrage, and the suffrage for blacks was to come later", Hattery said.
When you remember things like that, you realize with power why black women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues Ferguson raised - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a reflection of the time when white feminists were "catching" the problems that black women had been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to birth control?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
Well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist for the Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are markedly different in public opinion polls - will lead the change", Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is a more intersectional feminist, addressing issues of race as well as gender, some of her comments on the issue of race in America are puzzling.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contrasted with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is coming to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol has seized nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is coming to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to re-think the issue as a key women's issue, she would only have to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves", said Mercado.
If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are echoed in women's organizations", she said.
The pig house in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig making himself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is being offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig with its head on a sofa.
Connell's real estate agent said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo was published by mistake and has since been removed", a company spokeswoman said.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom single-family home".
Although the realtor removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional materials.
The sale of the house generated interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the purchase price.

A lottery player from Harvey is on this month's ballot.
The search for a new millionaire in South West Perth is ongoing, with one lucky winner winning nearly $1.1 million in Saturday's lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the Division I draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner still has to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win was a talking point in the small town southwest of Perth.
It's all the talk in town, and everybody's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit might occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated their first division wins last month, a fitting end to a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a gambler from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had just a few weeks earlier won the mega-win of $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the win would allow them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the WA First Division this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked for the gladiator arena.
It was not only the gladiators who were in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract yesterday well over 1000 visitors, who braved the rains and the autumn cold and were completely enthralled by the historic spectacle.
There was a wide range of performances, plays, exhibitions and information about the Roman period and its importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial unit of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting skills in the soft sand-covered arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter, sending his men one after another into the ring for heroic duels in various gladiator classes.
First, the "provocateurs" were in line with a rectangular shield and a short sword, with a leg rail on the left leg and a brace on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with breastplate, short sword and throwing-plant as well as iron gladiator helmets, leg and arm protectors.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who with a net, a tripod and a dagger attacked the "Secutor" and after a short fight knocked the boy to the ground.
The swords clashed metallically, the shields were cracked, and the plants were flying through the arena, so that one could become fearful for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had a watchful eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman times live", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organiser of the "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became, for one day, an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also to be admired in Roman times, such as "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1,400-meter-long Roman Canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company was comparing water and energy supply in the past and in the present, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is confirmed by the graduate measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Engineering Team Two" in Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as the Chorobat, the Groma or the Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating system that once heated the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left by wolves and foxes in the clay footprints two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landmarks Conservation Office of the Rhineland State Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of a farmhouse were found with a drying and milling machine.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She displayed a number of finds from these excavations in a glass case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and pieces of a fancy necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children also played the Roman windmill game, similar to the modern windmill game, or they wrote their names on wax tablets with metal handles, as did Roman schoolchildren.
At the Roman Thermal Zülpich, children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the Rheinbach Glass Museum, to make glass mosaics, and at the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center, to use a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind flour for flatbread or cereal.
The visitors drove through the leisure park with the original Roman carriage, drawn by two cold-blooded people, and also passed the impressive stand of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of its "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also participate in the 2014 Roman Year, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local and historical associations, the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laiepielkreis Oberbachem, thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered to remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire is told of his work on the nearby Wachterberg, plants are presented as living monuments from Roman times, and a funny lesson is taught on international understanding between a group of Wachterberg "Germans" and the nearby Romans.
The Adendorf Primary School is devoting a project week to the theme of the Romans.
The aim of the week is to make the numerous, often but not at first sight, traces of the Romans in Wachtberg visible again.
A small presentation at the Wachtberg Town Hall will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum Matron Sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is weighing on the economy of West Africa
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealing a severe blow to the economy of West Africa.
The crops rot in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has taken a toll on the region.
Some international companies are also already moving away.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one", says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we are losing a lot of money", says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes in Liberia's second largest market in the capital Monrovia.
The only people who come to the market are those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, with more than 600 people dying from the fever here alone.
Recently, health authorities declared that the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In all, more than 1,500 people have died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign firms withdrawing staff
Companies are shutting down all over the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local merchants and farmers are also responding, with few merchants leaving their hometowns to buy supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers don't dare leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People are going to travel less and less", says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Paris-based expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore experiencing the immediate and urgent effects of the epidemic: food is becoming scarce.
The markets are running out of basic foodstuffs, such as rice.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The crucial question is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may feel "that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia", warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the strained budgets of the Member States.
The disease also affects the already strained budgets of the countries affected.
Moody's, the ratings agency, fears that their budgets will be severely strained by high health care spending and the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged $60 million ($45 million) to help the health systems of the affected countries.
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected.
But in other parts of the world, many people are already staying home for fear of contracting the disease.
Hotel reservations are also falling sharply.
Shooters celebrating their 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau shooting club celebrates its 50th anniversary from September 12 to 14.
The preparations for the 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Tannenwald shooting club are going on from 12 to 14 September.
There's a big entertainment night planned for Friday, September 12th with the group "Village Rocker".
Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big boiler shooting.
Then, in the big party tent, the evening of the atmosphere with the "Stoapfalzer Spitzbuam".
The Blow Band Makes the Music
Highlights on Sunday are the 9:30 a.m. service at the parish church and the 2 p.m. procession.
In the afternoon, the prize-giving ceremony will be held for the Bundes- and Gauschicht.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies of the fair with their dirndlns.
The main band is the Berngau Blaskapelle.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützgesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercises in room-cleaning and small-bore shooting".
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves again, and on April 30 they baptized the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau in the Lukas Inn.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting masters through a difficult early period, in which it was mainly about finding a clubhouse and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the shooting club started in the "Leininger" guesthouse with two teams in the round-robin matches.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
Club records were surging every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active shooters has increased, so have membership numbers.
After the "Leininger" clubhouse no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2,700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Father Strasser gave the church's blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th shooting match, combined with the solemn dedication of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Shooters' Association celebrated its 30th anniversary of its founding.
A Böller group was set up in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl was appointed as the Böller rapporteur.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and for the club as a whole was the organisation of the 2005 Bavarian Böller Meeting.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof last year, bringing it up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round-robin competition
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round-robin competition: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one KK1 sport pistol team, one youth team and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has been promoted from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The second team, with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml, has been promoted from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as boxing, the Fascist and Royal Ball, club excursions and Christmas parties have a tradition.
The gunmen are also at the parish and community festivals.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident on his way back to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke on lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without speaking to reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed but now focused on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him", Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond, hoping we can do better there.
Stewart had earlier in the race on Sunday night crashed into a wall after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result", Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out".
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and were ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at a cinderella race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the chase.
He returned to his workplace while an investigation into the tragic incident leading to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. was underway, who had stepped on the pavement during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has been made as to whether Stewart will face prosecution.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a 12th-place start, Stewart had already moved into the top 10 shortly afterwards, and was temporarily ranked fourth.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs fell
Car 18 went out of control after exiting from turn 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars hitting the wall.
Stewart continued to race, but fell back to 21st.
Looking for a Dancing Baby
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma, and the head teacher, Lisa Neitzel (left), are looking forward to seeing their fellow contestants.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in TV Jahn provide full-time instruction at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated themselves.
Now more and more youngsters are being sought for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the eight- to 12-year-old group, six in the 12- to 15-year-old group", says the 20-year-old.
With more actors, it would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies", she says.
If you're interested in dancing, you can stop by the dance class on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or Fridays between 5 and 6:30 p.m. in the dance gym at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
"The training periodically begins with a warm-up program", says the trainer.
Afterwards, various choreographies are rehearsed.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical to sports and acrobatics are incorporated into jazz dance.
Of course, there is no shortage of social activities.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance movies, and have spent the night in the dance hall", reports Lisa Neitzel.
In a group, you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby, and do a lot of things to help your motor development.
If you don't like jazz, you can also check out one of the other offers on TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always sneak into classes on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance instructor is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance on Monday and Wednesday nights.
If you're interested in discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
The demands for higher salaries are also on a list to be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director General for the Implementation of Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The protest by prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union union Union of Interior Ministry employees.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still advancing.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tank battalions were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airfield of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today, Monday.
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership, without giving details.
Prussian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters, according to their own account.
About 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk in the Gulf of Mexico
The rebels also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coastguard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of their ships were shelled near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several towns in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine-Russia contact group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy from the separatists in eastern Ukraine was to attend.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to make their demands known to the public.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO would abide by the 1997 founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a flagrant breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO a partner", said Rasmussen.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show that they consider us to be enemies.
The EU is also a key partner in the EU's external relations.
Rasmussen has also announced his intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A 'Readiness Action Plan' to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that 'we will have a more visible NATO presence in the east for as long as it is needed', Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed to renew talks to resolve their gas dispute, according to official reports.
The talks are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the gas price dispute, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
The EU's energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, was the last to mediate between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia might also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe obtains about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says the toll will be "all clear"
The Chancellor is once again making a clear statement.
It's not a release for all the intricate details.
The CSU has been increasingly angered by persistent concerns from the CDU about the car toll.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out in favour of the introduction of a car toll after sustained opposition from her CDU.
"To put it plainly: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come", the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top committees in Berlin.
But Merkel has not yet decided on a detailed model.
The black and red government programme contains "certain parameters".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances and their derivatives is also a step in the right direction.
He also discussed with Dobrindt other ways of mobilising more private capital for infrastructure investment, including broadband.
Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to reward highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing tariff concepts against the minister-in-office.
The CDU's Federal Vice-President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never envisaged the construction of all the county and federal roads", said the CDU state chairman from North Rhine-Westphalia.
It is therefore an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will discuss the subject again.
Opposition to the plans also came from the CDU state associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll would affect small-scale border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty from the ranks of the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute within the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead", party leader Bernd Riexinger told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is scheduled to start in 2016.
The Coalition Agreement does not allow for any additional charges to be levied on domestic car owners.
The Commission therefore intends to provide them with full compensation for the toll through the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers on the basis of their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One British woman says that for many years she thought she would die because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers spent most of her youth believing that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are thought to have CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait, and crooked toes.
Patients also experience numbness or pain, and the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedrich ataxia, a disease with very low survival rates.
Rodgers thought she'd be in a wheelchair before she turned 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
A 51-year-old mother of two said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do what others did.
I kept falling and everything kept getting longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboard with the other children, and I was often teased at school for the way I walked and ran.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she was looking at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she had FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society", she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18, and I'd die at 25, and I'd lose all my skills in the meantime.
I did all this by myself, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, she realized that her abilities had not declined as much as she had imagined, and she consulted her doctor.
He just stood up, and he hugged me and he said, "Honey, I don't think you have it, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic testing, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like a winner", she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Staff Sergeant Berni Diether works as a firefighter since the former training ground was closed
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has been a place of silence.
Yet, deadly munitions still appear every month in the heart of the Biosphere Reserve of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they must be detonated on the spot.
The explosions echo a deafening sound over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectare area has been the core of the Schwäbische Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on Washington area businessmen rises as the economy recovers
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local corporate tax rulings in the country rose slightly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and the Washington area firms were no exception.
Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local governments in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax rate at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate real estate values, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of this profit came from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same pattern seems to be true for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a year-on-year increase of 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes account for just over one fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Corporations in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that a large portion of real estate, especially in the D.C. tax area, is either owned by the government or by nonprofit organizations that don't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to provide the same services as other states.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery in the housing market.
The data also show that corporate income is recovering.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government entities of $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising evenly in all three places.
The increase in the District was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rates in all three jurisdictions, at 6 percent (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent, and the District is a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia charges lower state and local corporate taxes and has a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the District.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to lower its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to as much as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized under - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster growth rate than corporate taxes combined.
The researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with general surplus tax revenues for state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the region could fall behind Washington if the Federal Government's spending cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination in China too.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city", said Li Yiwei, deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, this week, when he visited a SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the ruling Communist Party of China official returned to this concern of the 12 million metropolises during the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
The people therefore had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, promised the host that he would ask around in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much to make beer: good water, grain and joy of life", he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li was already radiating this joy of life, he flattered the host.
The official from Guangzhou then came up with shepherd's milk - but with red wine served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German embroidery.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
Increased trade
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it", the local politician said convinced.
"The trade between our two cities is continuing to grow".
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour through Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the air link.
The Vice-Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea", replied the shepherd-gimp - Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Partnership maintained
The light-hearted vice-party chief of Guangzhou hopes he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on Main, but not yet in this function.
He took office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations.
Local Party leader Wan Qinglian was also forced to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against party and administrative corruption, which is being rigorously enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was a senior official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The link to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometres away, is one of those maintained by both sides, such as a school exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the German-Chinese alliance was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse, with its economic power.
The EU's goal is to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros next year, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "pushes thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all have our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency cardiac arrest at Yorkville Endoscopy, an Upper East Side hospital, according to sources.
Doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with her condition, which is further described as "serious".
The reactions came from many quarters, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to improve the safety of the vehicles and the environment.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will be given a label from 1 September, which will enable the buyer to identify key data such as the energy efficiency of the appliance at a glance.
For new cars, higher nitrogen oxide levels are applied in the Euro 6 pollutant class.
There is also more money for scaffolding workers, who receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
Amazon just confirmed what Newsweek reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be acquired, but because it was widely speculated that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion dollars was a done deal, and the collaboration seemed natural.
Twitch, which was only launched three years ago as Justin.tv, had started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to publish their favorite feats in games, a "YouTube for live games", according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which experts give (mostly older) games a touch of mystery science theater, is already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube was going to buy Twitch was taken up a bit boringly, a textbook example of an established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't happen, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster".
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they'd rather play sports than watch, it's hard to understand the attraction of watching others play rather than holding the control console.
It's one thing to watch a friend at 3:00 a.m. sneak through Resident Evil, and it's another to watch a nut job get shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All those games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without having control over your perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I'll admit that the fast-paced, electronic-age Roger Bannisters completing entire games in record time is entertaining.
But unless there's a game or humor genius involved, his Twitch channel probably isn't that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic spikes.
And how exactly is Amazon going to make money off of it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would be integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company wants: thousands of young men who are being recruited as advertisers.
As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Saturday evening.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans attended the open-air festival in the castle garden.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt and light and fun.
Two Spanish words that Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have coined as Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedeler Castle Garden is supposed to radiate light by day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes naturally.
This was evident early Saturday evening when the first visitors set out for the open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they did.
The salt-weedlers and guests from the surrounding area had made themselves comfortable around the supply stands on the castle garden meadow.
They watched the first live performances, waved their feet, enjoyed cold drinks - in short, they were in for a blast.
And that's across generations.
While some were lounging on the beach bar's extra-curved white sand on the ceiling, others were sipping on a quarter of a wine in the wine shop, the younger ones were racing on the hop-on-hop-off, which was a major attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the case of baby makeup, volunteers were literally working hard to overcome the pressure and create imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones used the kickers or participated in a skateboarding workshop run by the Goodfoot crew of salt-weed.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he dashed down on the visitors, especially families searching the wide and dry.
But this did not diminish the attractiveness of the festival.
"More people than expected", said Ron Sem, who spoke of "a success all round".
That's why there's nothing to prevent a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first assessment on Sunday to the popular vote.
He was angry that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who were jamming in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound system.
The Salzwedish hip-hop group Blocks`n`Rox stopped their performance because of this.
The engineers were unable to produce a sound that was halfway reasonable.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be moved to Salzwedel because of a tire failure.
"But next year they will be there", says the organizer.
The opening of the Amula Open Air was a huge success.
And that's in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes which are still forgiven in the first edition but which must be corrected in the second edition.
The organizers of the social network Facebook must also be critical.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you just expected more", says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You've taken a little too much", says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others see the initial problems less narrowly.
I think it's very good that some people are not just talking stupid, but really trying to get something off their feet.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jens to the Amula.
The organisers now have one year to settle these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: the shrinking of the Wachterberg landmark
This is not the case, as you might expect.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the striking structure.
The action is part of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, known as the radom, is being completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller than the old one, with a diameter of 47.5 metres.
But the size still remains a world record.
The final step in completing the new cover is the cap change.
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
The last quarter of the new cover is then applied.
If the weather is good, the action is scheduled to take place early this week.
A contestant in the Ice Bucket Challenge is choking her jaw
Isabelle Roberts of Great Britain cried so much when she was poured ice-cold water over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
That ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after screaming so loudly during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she tore her jaw off.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain was so cringe-struck when she was poured ice-cold water over her head that she injured the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did it, my jaw just stopped", she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw it too and almost got their pants kicked in laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to hospital to have her jaw reattached after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs be back together soon?
There were always quarrels between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
The project in Guédelon, France, was led by the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Castle Friends, as a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser Castle.
A year ago, there was no good atmosphere between the Burgverein and the Burgfriends Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Castle and its possible reconstruction have been quite different.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: talks on a joint approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down", Sjöberg reports.
He believes that in future all members of both associations could be brought back together.
This is a more rapid way of achieving visible success.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until the last a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind, for the castle club around Sjöberg the "development and realization" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfriends, said he was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been the leader of the Castle Friends.
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September at a membership meeting.
The 74-year-old says the association currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we put the club's activities on hold out of respect", he said.
Piffl says the new chairman will then go into talks with the Burg club.
In the meantime, the castle friends could also get a current picture of the mood within their grouping.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the mandate of the European Parliament to the Council of Ministers.
"But I am confident that someone will be found". He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman was supposed to be a Wolffr House.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much willing to continue to cooperate".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's view for the foreseeable future.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar projects, already well advanced, in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a wind-up.
The Commission is also proposing a new directive on the protection of the environment and the environment.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first too.
But over time I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to continue the project". A "unique feature" could be created for the floating city.
There's nothing else here.
The project could also be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw away the idea of reconstruction". He hopes that the Burg Association may move on this point.
Their goal of documenting history first "is important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Smart Ways to Save on College Textbooks
Since the cost of college textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the near-second-year student Matt Schroeder came up with a clever savings idea.
He invented a system for borrowing books from graduate students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A cookie", said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
He said the books he needed for the last semester cost him $430.
He spent $120.
The college administration said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are various cost-cutting options available to students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that textbook rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, said Neebo's vice president Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time deal for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books online cost only a third of the price they cost in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind the notes of others or the usual usage marks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is on sale on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if earlier editions were acceptable.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar papers.
In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.
Rental of
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you treat them reasonably well, think about returning them and do not want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student might rent Calculus for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the shop you are renting from, including any penalties for writing notes, underlining or use marks.
Tenants beware: If you don't return the book, the fines can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's got Calculus for about $61 for six months.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, since many classics are available for free download today, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'll definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN for book pricing, as it can help you be sure you're finding the right textbook.
And before ordering online, Gault says, you should check if the book is actually in stock.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had a four-week delivery time and eventually paid full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Didn't Succeed
Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 made less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For only made $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's "Sex Tape" earned only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon's Tooth Made Easy 2" also disappointed in the box office.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason for the children's films.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" yet for children's films, describing "Dragon's Paw Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, when films are aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer movie launch that was shown on at least 2,000 screens between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of filmgoers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are on par with last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book film, told the website Hollywood Reporter: "I believe times are changing".
We must accept that and not try to chase after the past.
In contrast to the current weak box office performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved $1.2 billion in revenue from streaming content, almost double the amount of last year's $837 million revenue.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for focusing too much on comic book adaptations and predicted a "nuclear meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, with the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other film industry figures are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office earnings as simply "cyclical", telling Hollywood Reporters: "Next summer is going to be the biggest box office summer ever, and nobody's going to worry about business anymore".
When the 2nd Table Tennis District class was dropped a few years ago to streamline the league division, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to its programme.
The consequence is that whoever has not ascended has descended.
For example, Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo has avoided relegation in the Oberliga, but will play only fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedos ladies are still fourth, despite their grand run to the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve are competing in the new Bundesliga, in the Bundesliga there are no Göttingen clubs represented anymore.
The women's team is represented by TTV Geismar in the Verbandsliga, and the Torpedo Second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better county class is now the new county top-flight South.
The clubs involved are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the regional league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district women's top league starts at least in goal strength.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with us.
The district league is contested by Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen.
With nine teams each
SC Weende is sending their girls to the minor leagues.
The SCW boys' district league season - Torpedo II is still there - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligas start with nine teams each.
The West team is made up of the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
The East Division is contested by the teams of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The women's circuit league is made up of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
That's still better than Osterode County, where there are no women's teams at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six second-class districts reaches the target strength, and the innovative and ambitious district board will have to think about this.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests at the weekend by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, some 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and speaking to protesters who have travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains flew out
TWO young bushwalkers were brought to safety by the wind rope after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains of NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after noon on Sunday at Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and emergency services went on the run and the couple was found at around 11pm near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescuers stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
You were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition by ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The 1,000 protesters were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The station resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters armed with sticks had damaged equipment in the newsroom.
No casualties were reported.
The protesters demand the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said clashes between about 3,000 protesters and security forces broke out again on Monday, about a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend as protesters tried to break into Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using force" after a meeting at army headquarters on Sunday evening.
The statement added: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has been a frequent coup in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been going on since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had urged their followers to persevere on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign", Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary elections in May last year by fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The protesters had initially held peaceful protests outside the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second win of the season to third place in the table.
With the 2:0 win over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday for Rapid has come to a peaceful end.
"The victory is very liberating", said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team reached a mid-table finish with the Europa League knockout on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important", confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who led the green-white to third place.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to the winner's circle Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the inter-county play-offs with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction", said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the pace for the victory with his magnificent sixteen-corner lead in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd take all the frustration from Thursday and put it under the bar", the 26-year-old said with a smile.
When Schrammel hit for the last time in a Bundesliga game on 13 November 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first match in the Rapid Dress Championship will therefore be a special memory for him.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid generation", said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pelvic-blessur of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there too.
He has enough experience to be able to hold this position in a mirror.
He deserved the goal, he's already made a few assists this year", Barisic said.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after well over an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we had some luck today", said Schrammel, referring to the split between performance and results in recent weeks: "The results have not been the same, but the game has always been good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that they had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July had therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that it has character".
He was just as happy to hear that we had finally scored zero again.
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have been out several times, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their debuts in the starting line-up, also makes the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that", warned Barisic, who has lost players in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic, "who have been very stable lately".
The national team has to use the break to "lick wounds and get a little more physical", explained Barisic, who has five U21 players in his team.
One of the people who's particularly interested in taking a break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, going through pain.
It is in this difficult period that he has shown that he is a very important player for us", Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the Rapids the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who played his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
We've had a bit of luck, but at some point, we'll have to get back to that.
Now it was high time", said Hofmann.
He urged, of course, to concentrate on the task: "You can't always see it in black and white.
We have not played as badly as has been portrayed in recent weeks.
But we mustn't believe that everything is fine now.
He couldn't deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team, and I can help a lot right now.
They are attached to me at certain points", said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-hit "from the category of magic goal", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly dismissed by referee Kollegger.
The only reproach I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal at some stages.
We didn't have enough degrees.
Defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found the net and even scored a goal.
There would have been more in it, by and large.

We showed a mighty tribe in our puzzle for the summer series "My piece of Rhône happiness" last Friday.
Several of these giants still exist in the county, the one pictured is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the oak tree, which is about 600 years old.
It passes by couplings, basalt piles and basalt lakes.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
The natural monument is vibrant, towering above the other trees in the area and resembling an American mammoth tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only clues to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheim Archive and interviewed elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what connection it has with the geissruhe.
The result of his research was a rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, goat herders were said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the hard-harvested and stone-free meadows.
The climbing-weary animal keepers are said to have rested at the foot of the tree.
The area has since regained its importance, with flocks of goats grazing on the meadows.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has found out further.
But caution should be exercised when entering the rock collections, for the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular habitat for crested terns.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other routes are marked upwards in the direction of Hochrhön and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought for in our next task, is rather rare to find at height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the structure, but we have some historic buildings in the county that the building's facade could fit in.

After weeks of stumbling, Italy's Prime Minister and EU President-in-Office, Matteo Renzi, has pushed through the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as EU foreign policy chief, replacing Britain's Catherine Ashton, despite strong conservative opposition at last week's EU summit.
Renzi, as reported by the government-run daily La Repubblica, sees the appointment of Mogherini, who is also his favourite member of the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also hopes that this will give a boost to his reform package in Italy.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment, which is to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the new rules to the Member States, which will be implemented in the coming months.
The EU's chief diplomat will also be a deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The outstanding approval of the EU Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has been in the party's top office for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will be able to meet the "huge challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
The political scientist started her political career in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic centre-right party Margherita in 2008 to form the current Social Democratic Party.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the party council of the Left Democrats, she entered the party's high politics, working in the foreign policy department, of which she soon became head.
It has traditionally focused on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, has been known for studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and has maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD is now better off than the country's strong peace movement, which contributed over 40 percent of the party's vote in the May EU elections, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a stake in it.
The complaints in Brussels that the new EU foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience, so that there is no substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltic states, Mogherini's suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being denounced as a "pro-Russian course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, thus also providing energy security for Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini made her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos of them shaking hands with Putin were taken with indignation in Brussels, as was the fact that she invited the Kremlin chief to an October economic summit in Milan.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has previously completed another training course at the company.
The new employees will be employed in four training occupations: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices had previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages and instructors travel to Oberammergau for a team training event, which includes a full-day hike and rafting at the inn.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of apprentices in all grades is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order", said Francois Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "its love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain at his side", he said to a great applause.
In a soothing gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour work week in France despite strong demands for a relaxation of the rule by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show 'unity' with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, threw sand in the gear when she appeared at a meeting of defector socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking away the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant trench warfare and said she could not imagine the new Valls government lasting more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none, and they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not survived even one summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter either", Ms Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident of winning early elections and was ready to form a government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections and the right-wing National Front won the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must feel quickly that things are changing", he warned.
Otherwise the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises .
According to industry experts, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end in a draw.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 per cent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources requested anonymity as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the prior year.
The cruise industry is worth some $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years as the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India strengthens.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers among the cruise operators.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 per cent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 per cent of the shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP 8 per cent of the shares, according to the licensing authorities.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together hold more than 82% of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original listing documents of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A group of Beijing loyalists waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday passed a framework law that allows only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee, which is expected to be composed of Beijing-loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get elected and prompted pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and cripple the financial hub of Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper in June outlining China's dominance over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched to the city's business district and organized a sit-in.
The survey is organised by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were to be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership office this afternoon.
The British did not see any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial rule in Hong Kong.
Putin demands that Kiev hold "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday, according to Russian media reports, that the Ukrainian government cease fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-à-vis Ukraine would have to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian rebels, however, fits the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the riots five months ago: helping the separatists to take territory and pressuring the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to achieve de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake the separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia", a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin noted that all those who hope for early peace talks in the run-up to the October 26 election campaign by Ukrainian politicians and as government groups attack civilian communities in separatist-held areas are "trapped in their illusions", Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to immediately start detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, to protect the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by Kiev's leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine".
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification on the correction of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict showed a large majority in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is home to most of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislature should consider amendments to the constitution after new elections, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders on an equal footing followed another rebel advance last week, after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists have taken control of Novosovsk in what Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
This is why massive civil and military preparations have been made to fortify Mariupol, a steel-industry port of 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novosovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are about to reach a point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which are to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, believed to have been trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowask, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal involving Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noble made no secret of his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood's A-listers.
The film city is in a state of upheaval after a series of unmistakable photos of a nude Jennifer Lawrence in a celebrity hacking scandal surfaced on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this is believed to have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tribute from Panem", and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also reportedly exposed to private photos due to an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who was engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential, "It's disgusting".
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected "felt hurt".
The hacker has probably 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her naked upstairs in a pool.
Palmer's films include "Love is Unbeatable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comment yesterday about the hacked images.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ, "It's a heinous invasion of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked photos from a mobile phone is nothing more than selling junk goods".
From a purely legal point of view, the re-distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers attended the 8th cycle on the Große Feldberg yesterday and supported the association "Help for Cancer-Sick Children".
The tour, which was torture for some, was easy training for others.
But there was one thing they all agreed on: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
Because for the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brewery rode his bike to Feldberg yesterday.
For the good.
He can easily hide the small muscle ache, especially since his participation in the 8th cycling on the Große Feldberg for the Association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) has also brought him a valuable personal insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - great!"
Little peacock on the way to the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler city parliament, many of the 718 participants were torturing themselves in the morning dew yesterday and arrived on the plateau near exhaustion but happy.
Others found it easier to cover the seven-mile [11 km] distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
The Commission has not yet decided on the matter.
The green politician from the district, who was wearing red - red dress, red bike - was a bit understated at the start ("Every bunch of professionals, there is a goal to arrive!"), but then proved himself to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without a breath.
He also completed the course in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set out with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "It's about charity, we're happy to be involved - we would have done a trip today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to start climbing again.
The Frankfurt-based Florian Zierz had gotten into his saddle at home at 9 a.m., "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
I had fun with "Fried-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, bike tours over the Feldberg are just part of it.
He had been riding his 6.5-pound racing bike for 40 minutes.
It was a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be involved", said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer describes himself as an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must be, because he was riding the "Fixie Wheel", which is also a racing bike, but without a circuit...
Not only did 20 hikers climb the White Wall and the fox dance to the top, but a jogger pulled a car tire with weights on a cord to prove that it was easy to climb without a wheel.
Professor Volker Lischke, a mountain guard doctor who, with his team, equipped with all-wheel-drive bullies and quad, provided security, said: "I know this one from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled, only he pulls the sled himself". So the man is, in a sense, his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - the largest ever - were sent out in groups in the morning.
The walkers first at 9:30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the "Bicycle to the Great Field" Association, gave the start commands and wished the participants a pleasant trip.
He hopes that next year he will be able to close the route up the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
