Barack Obama becomes the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, at 6 p.m. to become the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and $1.4 million check will be awarded for, among other things, his extraordinary efforts to advance world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief is flying into the Norwegian capital with his wife Michelle in the morning, and he's gonna be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five members of the committee that selected him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then has a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He's the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third to receive it while in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be speaking about the Afghan war at the award ceremony.
The president doesn't want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he's taking the price as the president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He's stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which he's not gonna forget to point out to any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma, and a cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's gonna give it to charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The President and the bride will then begin the rich program at a banquet, where the Norwegian King and Queen will be joined by the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests.
From the beginning, Obama was rather reserved about the price.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeatedly stated that the prize was not for himself but for all who shared his values.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was "called to action".
Conservationist accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Conservation Society of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some construction controls, demanded money from investors for his benefit in return for withdrawing the appeal, said litoměřic police spokeswoman Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Litoměřice Society of Conservationists is Lubomír Studnička.
He's now in custody, facing up to three years in prison.
The Brno sorting containers don't smell very good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their beverage containers, and in the villages of South Moravia, sorting containers are found everywhere.
And in the Gate?
There you will have a few minutes to spare before you find a suitable dump.
I'm not saying that Brno doesn't have a waste disposal system.
But it seems to me that, being the second largest city in the republic, the council is not sufficiently interested in this problem.
The problem is that we as citizens can still throw paper, glass and plastic into the sorting containers, but mainly because of the number of garbage disposal sites.
Have you ever tried, say, throwing a PET bottle in the wastebasket at the mall?
It's a big job, but it takes time and nerves.
The only place I've come across so far is Moravian Square, opposite Potrefené House.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think it's worth much.
Not to mention, the other parts of the world have no sorting system.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort their garbage.
It's from laziness.
They're a long way from the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to throw away some glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But I haven't seen any colored ashtrays on Kounicova Street for a while.
Luckily, I came across the right place on my way to the saddle.
But the waste was overflowing.
After all, it's still the center of Brno, which the city represents the most, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics don't seem to interest the Brno socialists.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey league that'll make a fool of the whole republic than buy a few more containers and offer to sort out more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad to say that after a little bit of surfing the web, I was able to confirm my guess with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
The "father" budget took away money for pensions and sickness
After the left has added money to farmers and officials against the government's wishes, there may be no money in the budget for pensions, sickness, or building savings.
But also interest on the national debt or international litigation.
This will create problems for those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists pushed for raises for certain groups, they relied on the government to borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions, or sickness. "It's just postponing problems into the future, laying mines", says Janota.
The borrowed money pays ever higher interest and must eventually be repaid.
The state doesn't have much of a choice in which to take.
If they don't reduce welfare or the cost of running the government, they have to raise taxes.
All the people the left has now added: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And later, their children.
People don't have to worry about pensions or sickness, whose accounts have been wiped out by $1.8 billion, they get them.
But at the cost of becoming more indebted, next year we'll have not just $163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janotta, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly raise the VAT or reduce maternity leave, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Because of the shifting of money to favor a few groups of voters, there will also be a shortfall of five billion dollars next year for the construction of highways and railways.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that it is compatible with the internal market pursuant to Article 107 (3) (c) of the Treaty.
Mostly conserve, which is not free.
This means the delay or halt of thirty major construction projects, and the draining of European money, warns Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD suggested that the shortage of money would be solved in a shallow way by reaching the ČEZ dividends, which the state owns for the most part, and from which it would contribute to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, let alone infinite.
Last year, 18 billion came from the CEZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividend is used to pay for the liquidation of environmental damage, to supplement the pension account or to serve as a reserve for the forthcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
But the carnival of moves doesn't end there.
Nearly three billion dollars was spent on various compensation programs for victims of communism and crime, on litigation, and even on building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will still have to pay for it, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money within the department or in the worst case, tap into the government's budget reserve.
Another $100 million is missing for the $2 billion Treasury Department project that is already underway to track what each government department is spending online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance doesn't find money elsewhere, the project will have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will run on two operating systems
Americans are counting on a mobile phone in the future that will allow users to switch between different operating systems with the push of a button.
The plans revealed are promising.
With the touch of a button, you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This is the aim of the US company VMware, which is mainly focused on developing computer virtualization software.
We're going to allow you to run two user profiles on your mobile at once.
You can switch between them, you can split them into home and work.
Both will be working at the same time, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and it was first shown a few days ago.
It's coming to market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to the press a prototype smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, running Windows Mobile and Android side by side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American carriers to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains is a concern for hoteliers
Naked slopes aren't just for the Krkonoše people.
The lack of snow is even discouraging people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That's why we can still get rooms in the Krkonoše for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's.
We have a lot of traffic on our website.
People are going through the listings, checking the prices, but they're afraid to make a binding order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be in snow or in mud", said the operator of the Spindl.Info information portal Martin Jandura.
They say that if you want a perfect New Year's Eve stay at Spindler's Mill, you should not hesitate to order.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation is second to none, can try to wait a few days.
The hotel owners in Spindler are currently offering only one-week stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they'll give in and go for a shorter time.
And then the available rooms will be running out fast", Jandura predicted.
The free beds are still available for all winter dates from the tourist office Ingtours in Vrchlab.
Our main interest right now is the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
About half the seats in our offering are still open.
That's why we've already found some cheaper last-minute Christmas holidays", said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Tourist Office in Vrchlab offers a few more places, but there are fewer available.
The first 14 days of February are also good for sales, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the lack of snow in the Krkonoše mountains is having a negative impact on the interest in winter holidays.
People are waiting to see if he'll attack.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on a mountain without snow.
If the ski slopes are snowed in during the week, Christmas will be sold out", says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the occupancy rate of the Horizont Hotel in Peć pod Sněžkou is slightly better than last year.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few seats on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest in Polish holidays in January and sales are good in February", said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
80% of the New Year's Eve stays are booked at the Omnia Hotel in the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the other hand, at Christmas, half the beds in the newest hotel in Janskolazan are still free.
We are pleasantly surprised this year by the January, which is already about sixty percent occupied at this moment.
February is a little weaker, but once the snow hits, the interest in stays in the Krkonoše Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel Erik Sporysch.
However, the Krkonoše hotel owners have to eat up the snow for a while.
Thursday is supposed to be cool, so if there's any precipitation, the mountains should be snow-covered.
But then the weather will warm up again, said Jiří Jakubský from the Château de Châteauneuf office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's funny how Barack Obama, the smartest president in the world, with schoolboy zeal, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the dumbest, on the Afghan issue.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it from Bush's Iraq script three years earlier.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he didn't hesitate to use the name of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A new way forward".
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to civil war-torn Iraq as "an irresponsible and consequently disastrous decision".
But the ensuing months showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of his field commanders, was the only one possible, and so successful that today Iraq is not even mentioned in the news.
It didn't improve Bush's reputation, but it did leave his successor with a much more grateful starting position than one might expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, most notably the top commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinate's custom, sharply criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to turn the tide.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so he at least cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to extort the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic part of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan as soon as 18 months from now and finish the process within three years.
Many doubt that a half-pay rise will yield the same fruit as the Iraq action.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-ordered, its leaders honoring the agreement.
The Afghan situation is the opposite - no one can be trusted and no agreements are being kept.
Badly prepared in these conditions are the Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing masters every day as they see fit.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain a suburban village, under which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult because of the opaque relationship that further complicates the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Nor does building an "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, seem very realistic.
The timeline of Obama's strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and is now on the verge of exploding.
To believe that soldiers sent into the war to "return home" will be able to perform a miracle here, is something only a truly romantic, untouched soul can believe.
From a political point of view, it is irresponsible to set a date for the withdrawal of troops, as the Taliban will see it as an implicit admission of American defeat.
The recent NATO summit has shown that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is declining.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is connected to the war in the foothills of the Indus.
Another factor that could radically affect the situation is the developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran fail to work, the United States will face the overwhelming question of whether to try to resolve the problem by military force.
The answer to that will be at the time when Obama says America will move to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any such solution would also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only thing that's patched up for Barack Obama is the fact that we're three years away from the presidential election, so there's plenty of time for him to come up with another strategy if this one turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer be paid in cash.
The senior executives of Goldman Sachs are not getting paid in cash this year.
This was announced by a company that is responding to the sharp criticism of its payroll practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive stock in exchange for money, which can be sold in no more than five years.
In addition, shares may be taken from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is leading the charge to link Wall Street rewards with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire after setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of compensation in the company this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High wages in the banking sector became a hot political topic in many countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced Wednesday that it would tax bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000 at a flat rate of 50 percent.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
A record five women took over from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden this year's Nobel Prize in Literature and the Arts in Stockholm.
Among the four women was German-Romanian writer Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
The prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath, together with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was won by American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only major that didn't have a holder this year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to Charles Kao for his research in optical fibres and to George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes and astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal, and a certificate of financial reward.
The amount of the aid is SEK 10 million (approximately SEK 25 million) for each category.
If there are more honorees in each, they share the reward among themselves.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy surrounding his award, as he is only at the beginning of his career and is also the head of a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defending his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to maintain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janot, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and perhaps Janot's continued cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also criticizing the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further aggravates the public finances crisis.
The meeting was reported by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his remaining term with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget bill that Klaus is now getting to sign, the Czech Republic would have to run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the House voted to approve the left's proposals for money transfers and increased money for state employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democrats' proposals for covertly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, there was a sharp internal political dispute, which began to raise questions about the future of Fischer's cabinet, which was agreed to by the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party in the spring.
Critics say the budget as passed by the House of Commons is essentially an end to the austerity package that Fischer's government pushed through in the fall, which it says is designed to stop the government's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at a business breakfast today that politicians had long neglected "a serious problem" that is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He doesn't think there's a good solution today.
The President said that only a strong government could bring about improvements, and that it could also rely on a wider consensus of political parties.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should consider another existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of a cabinet of officials with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánka by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánka government had prepared for this year, which exceeded 200 billion crowns, was frightening.
As of Wednesday, the CPSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The common people were also pleased.
Mandel was played by Morgan Freeman in the Clint Eastwood newsreel.
South Africans claim that Hollywood's new film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and its triumphs, despite some critics who say the lead roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The untiring fighter against South Africa's racist apartheid regime and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that a 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in an Eastwood movie.
Another prominent role in the film is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in Eastwood's boxing-themed drama Million Dollar Baby, has played, for example, an abolitionist leader who eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in The God Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
Former South African statesman who spent 27 years in prison for his activism to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is Latin for "undefeated", and it's the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will finally advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for years to get Mandel's story on the screen.
"I had no other goal than to play this role in a way that brought it as close to reality as possible", Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage for his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake hands with Mandel.
I found that when I press your hand, I take your energy, it transfers, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays Francois Pienaar, the captain of the predominantly white national rugby team.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rugby world.
The big surprise for him was when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look much bigger in the movie".
Despite the obvious differences in the actors' characters compared to their actual performances under Eastwood's direction, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and there are talk of Oscar ambitions.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his review in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film".
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the Norwegian light has been solved: the Russians have tested a missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that they had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile, designated as the "Bulava" type, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian military, is slowly becoming the black death of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Nor did his repeated presence on the test rocket have any effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, the drone never took off or was damaged in mid-air.
The Russian newspapers are already writing about the "Bulava" as a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This is the 13th attempt in a row to start off normal.
Then, at the end of the flight, there was another technical malfunction.
Apparently, the engine blew up in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, the "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was floating under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows it to be launched from a vessel that is both moving and submerged.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light over Norsk caused by a nearby unidentified flying object was indeed the "Bulava" that was damaged.
The Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time, saying that there is no clear-cut failure.
The first two stages of the rocket survived, and the accident only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines failed in the first stage.
Although no test run was completely flawless, only six of the 13 were considered by the Defense Department to be unsuccessful.
The almost 50 percent success rate fills the generals with optimism, and they still claim that the "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will be playing in a professional hockey game again at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will be helping his team CSKA Moscow in their hour of need and will likely be starting Friday's KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš's injury, we need another defender.
Fetisov is training regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formal stuff, the AP quoted Moscow club coach Sergei Nemchinov as saying.
It's unclear if the hockey star's comeback will be a one-game affair.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said Nemchinov.
Fetisov will become Russia's oldest professional hockey player if he returns to the ice, according to the AP.
In the NHL, the 51-year-old played a full season for Hartford legendary forward Gordie Howe, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetisov, Kasatonov-Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the uniform of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the world junior championship.
In the second half of his career, he also had success in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in a sweep by Detroit.
He is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
The management of the Hyundai trucking company has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
Due to the frequent overtime, the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
But the management wants to make an agreement with the union to work one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up our production schedule, it is essential, that's why a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19 with two shifts, Vaněk said.
The company of employees who work Saturday shifts offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People get it back for the working Saturday of November 28th.
According to Vank, the company decided to change the way it motivated employees for the proposed overtime.
They can either take an overtime pay or take a day off on December 28 to extend their Christmas holiday by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts receive a paid commute and lunch.
As overtime was the most urgent and pressing issue in terms of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and the protesting employees who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, auto workers were forced to work two hours overtime after an eight-hour shift each day.
After the agreement is signed, the unions will call off the strike alert.
The next meeting between the car company and the union is scheduled for Friday morning.
The union leader Petr Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the auto plant escalated last Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over the constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged harassment.
Management objected to having employees work overtime to meet the car delivery requirements.
In their Monday emergency declaration, the unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions are demanding that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
They're also offering a reward of 5,000 crowns this year.
The carrier Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The company started mass production in November last year.
By September this year, it had produced some 80,000 vehicles, with a current production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on 'live' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works against viruses that have already acquired immunity to the drugs.
In some cases, this outweighs the fact that the compound does not have the same potency as some of the medicines already available against the common variant.
AIDS is still incurable.
However, a mixture of drugs that prevent HIV from multiplying in the body can significantly prolong the life of patients.
However, their use is associated with a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral replication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to tackle virus resistance.
They showed that substances called metalcarboranes interact with the protein responsible for HIV replication.
Metal carbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that no other drug in use today can, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, the scientists come up with new 'enhanced' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metal-carbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms are joined by a metal atom, in this case, cobalt.
A Treacherous and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease-induced cleavage of HIV, no mature infectious viral particles would be produced.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the virus spreading in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of keys (see table) are connected by a short organic chain that is then systematically modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effects of this HIV protease inhibitor series have been tested in test tubes and against resistant variants derived from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metal carbonates on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it is not lost on resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications make metalcarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at designing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezeczová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is going after Fischer, he's defending himself.
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "scary" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider a new one.
The Prime Minister called ODS's comments strong statements.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
ODS Vice-Chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of a bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party clearly does not work anymore.
The prime minister must decide whether he wants to rely on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit or to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House has increased money for state employees' salaries, for running social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's response to the Social Democrats' proposals was to increase the budget deficit covertly.
The Czech Republic would have to manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the House before the vote, so much so that the amended budget is less bad than the provisional budget.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a feeling of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if he seriously threatened Janota with resignation if the amendments were adopted, the situation could be different.
According to Czech TV, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering a continuation of his tenure.
It's because of his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer declares that he will continue to fight the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the nominees of the ČSSD, which has implemented the budget changes, will have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes further deficit-increasing bills, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the Employment Act.
Topolánek: The ODS nominated ministers are not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries, deputies are people who claim to be TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
He stressed that if Fischer decided to abandon the principle of fighting the public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he would rely on the left-wing majority currently in the Chamber".
But then, he says, he can't count on the support and tolerance of the citizen democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it comes up, I will deal with it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS has stepped in.
He also pointed out that ODS would have voted against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the MPs of the Civic Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question whether the ODS did not complain about the absence of the party chairman in parliament and the Czech Republic during the political budget negotiations.
I didn't notice that my voice was missing.
"When I was giving up my mandate, I knew that the next few months would be about the Bolshevization of the Chamber and the destruction of everything positive", Topolánek himself said.
Under the new schedule, fewer trains will run at almost the same fare.
Czech Railways will cancel or reduce some less busy express and local lines from December 13, while strengthening other lines.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by 2% from the date of entry into force of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including the basic and customer fares, will remain unchanged.
For example, the residents of Ostrava will have more opportunities to connect to the capital, with the tracks adding one pendolino set to this line.
The express train, on the other hand, will stop running to Bratislava.
The number of express trains will also be reduced on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, and the direct connection between Prague and Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
The regions with the largest reduction in traffic are the Královéhradecký Region, with a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings are expected to see an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to only some days of the week.
The biggest changes are the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice has to change in Lysé nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Long-distance services to the capital will terminate at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
The train to Bratislava will be closed to passengers from December 13th.
Regional railway budget this year: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays for the fast cars, and in total, the so-called demonstrable losses will be reimbursed to the drivers by 4 billion crowns next year, just like this year.
This year, regional trains are $200 million more expensive.
The newly signed contracts for both the locks and the fast track are for ten years, whereas the previous contracts were for one year.
The railroads are very happy with the system, so it seems that the vast majority of the tickets have not contributed to the price increase.
The changes will only be made to the daily network tickets of ČD Net and the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of the e-ticket will depend on the distance travelled, so far it was uniform for travel between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Filipino militants still holding over 50 people, children released
Gunmen kidnapped 75 people today in the southern Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which had initially reported only 65 kidnappings.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a human shield to escape the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police initially pursued the kidnapper because of the violence that required settling accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao over a recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the gubernatorial election were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan tribe, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood, Invictus (Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela, will be released in theaters across the United States.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid activist was played by Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela to play the role years ago.
The male supporting role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar has been snubbed by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, the film has been met with critical and public acclaim.
♪ I'm not a man ♪
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The news comes as South Africa is in the midst of a World Cup soccer tournament, and the media is also reeling from disturbing reports of rising racial hatred and discrimination by the country's black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in the South is generally positive, despite the many reservations about casting the lead roles with "screwed-up" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the new film, as he says.
I've dreamed of this role for years and prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to, as they say, "get his energy", he said in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use the film to recall Mandela's personality and message.
It is the story of the South African Republic, but it is the story of every man, he added.
In the national rugby team kit
The film, based on the book by British author John Carline, titled In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made the Nation, portrays the South African human rights defender during his first term as president.
So in the film, Morgan Freeman is trying to reconcile two racial groups that have been divided for years, and just like in 1995 with Nelson Mandela, he's going to be an actor in the South African national rugby team on the field of the World Cup, which the South African team won.
For entering the field in a jersey, which is regarded in South Africa as almost sacred, Mandela was applauded by a predominantly white audience 14 years ago and won the respect of the white population.
The soccer championship may be able to bring people back together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
But white South Africans are skeptical, as recently revealed by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country for Britain, in a recent interview with LN.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
A transformator burning at Lounsku for tens of millions of crowns
A fire broke out in the transformer of the company "Cheps" in the distribution center near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
According to the spokesman of the Ustice regional firefighters Lukáš Marvan, six units are intervening in the fire.
The firefighters originally wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later changed their minds and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special fire extinguishers.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured, according to company spokesperson Pavla Mandatova, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, but it will be possible to calculate it only after the fire is over.
The Mandate requires a new transformer to replace the one that's been destroyed.
In the ten years of the company's existence, nothing like this has happened, and this type of malfunction is rare, she added.
According to Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, ČEZ spokesperson for Northern Bohemia, electricity supply was not interrupted, and the operation of households, offices and businesses was not affected by the fire at the substation.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the transmission system, the 400 kV and the 220 kV electricity lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 power stations with 67 transformers that transfer electricity from the transmission to the distribution network and 4339 kilometres of pipeline.
Jančura is filing a criminal complaint for slandering three hejtmans from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura is filing a criminal complaint today for slander against three social-democratic Heitmans.
And that is to Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Heimatman of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařik.
Janczura reported it in the Twenty Minutes of Radiojournal.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in certain counties.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All three of them are attacking us, talking about us picking raisins, when we've only brought an offer for what they want.
They say we're more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for slandering the Student Agency, he told Radio Jančura.
He also stated that he had evidence from all the regions that they had not acted in accordance with European law.
It therefore prepares a complaint to the European Commission.
Hasek sees the filing of the criminal complaint as another continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves him as unpaid publicity for his company and his own person.
I am prepared to defend my good name and that of my country and to do the same to other Heimatmen.
I suppose that it will also be clear on this occasion that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public and using false and untrue arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, said Hašek.
Last week, Jančura announced that he would invest several million crowns in advertising to warn the public about the unfortunate move of the regions.
He told the radio news that he would stop campaigning after Christmas and continue after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
Jančura launched the campaign after the counties agreed to operate regional railway connections with České drahy and did not sign tenders for the contract worth about 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura, such actions are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, Jančura was threatened by the ČSSD MP for his criticism of rail transport in the counties.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know who he is, I won't say his name, he told Radio Žurnálu Jančura today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccination from January will break with the established practice.
It's supposed to be the first to be free and non-compulsory for families.
But there are already voices that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of a free pneumococcal vaccination are in full swing.
The FDA is already setting the maximum price for vaccines that health insurance companies will pay.
The experts also have a clear understanding of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for children in August
From January, children born on or after 2 August last year can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The stipulation is that they haven't had a single dose of the vaccine.
Anyone who started vaccinating last year or earlier has to pay for the additional vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Just last year, a quarter of families volunteered to have their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
Parents paid $1,200 for a single dose or more.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend $300,000 to $450,000 a year on vaccinations.
But it saves on the treatment that the unvaccinated kids would need.
Up until now, the state has given about $500,000 a year for all the vaccinations.
The vaccination was introduced in the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to the survey of hospitals, up to 28 children under 10 die every year from pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 countries have introduced paid vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease.
Will vaccination be required?
At the same time, there are concerns that such vaccination could be made compulsory in the future.
As of January, it's to be paid by the insurance companies and optional.
The head of the civil society group, Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsky, suggested that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we're glad that we've managed to get this one.
I think that's the path we need to take now, said Kalovsky.
But the Ministry of Health is not changing the vaccination schedule against pneumococcus.
At the moment, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors
Hannah Cabrnoch, president of the Professional Society of Pediatric Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, it would be possible to consider reducing the number of revaccinations. "For a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we can reasonably understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary", says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect that by next year more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated against pneumococoniasis.
The pneumococcal vaccine is also groundbreaking in that it is the first mass vaccination of children paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving money on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy their own drugs
But there is a concern among pediatricians about the purchase of vaccines.
The original plan was to have insurance companies buy the vaccines and doctors get them in the same way that the government supplies them with vaccines.
Some lawmakers, however, worried that insurance companies could "draw money out of health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy drugs and wait for insurance to pay for them.
It's estimated that individual practicing pediatricians will invest $40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It's not going to be easy, Cabrnoch says.
Son of an American artist 'robbed from museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy creator Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempting to steal $20 million (£12 million) worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania State Police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his car and trailer.
A man named Mr. Frazetta and another man used a dredge to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta, Sr., age 81, is famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta, Jr. may have been motivated by long-standing family feuds.
Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, gave a sworn statement to the police that he did so at his father's direction, "to get into the museum by any means possible and move the paintings to the matching room", the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied granting any such authorization as stated by the agency.
Labour opposes planned tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories "missed" the opportunity to show they were serious about delaying the decision to cut the deficit until after the election.
Even the chancellor has come under fire for the impact on low- and middle-income workers.
According to its proposal, these are mainly an increase of 0,5% in social security and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Social security confusion
Unions protested that low-wage workers were being punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social Security is rising - an increase of around £3 trillion a year - which has outraged the business community, who have said it's a tax on employment, whereas the focus should be on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
The following table shows the number of samples of the product concerned:
Social security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen by more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of the banker's bonus
1% increase in corporate tax for depreciation of small businesses
The Commission recalled that the Commission had already established that the measures were compatible with the internal market.
Increase of 2,5% in the amount of pensions
The Treasury estimates that some incomes of £30,000 will be reduced by £90 per annum and some incomes of £40,000 will be reduced by £190, while some incomes of £10,000 will be increased by £110.
Ministers announced that their target of halving the deficit by 2013 was a "difficult decision", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should go to the top 5% of earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax hikes and spending cuts were a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would be necessary.
"These are big numbers. They will enable us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years", the BBC reported.
Mr Timms said he believed that economic growth should occur at the turn of the year.
But the development of projections for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of borrowing needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be considered after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, the economy contracted 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% contraction predicted in April - because borrowing was £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A wasted opportunity.
Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday to warn of a "debt crisis" for Labour, have called the planned £789 billion loan over the next six years "untenable".
The ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be paid for, they added, cynically postponing the decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything of significance that could be done", said Shadow Chancellor Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they squandered it".
"All important announcements will be made after the election, if we win it".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, is the man who invented the first computer.
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tories' proposals, which would reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that money raised by tax hikes and spending cuts should be used to boost spending next year rather than to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said that the timing of the announcement - for example, the aforementioned inflation will increase and there will be a failure to pay benefits next April - could lead to the Chancellor being blamed in the election campaign if the money is hard to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special help if people are in dire need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The renowned Institute for Budgetary Studies said the Chancellor's figures indicate substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education and defense.
"It's really very painful so far", said its director Robert Chote.
"All the big announcements will come after the election if we win", added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte's accounting reviewer.
"That was a report on a suspected preliminary budget.
The FBI is conducting an investigation into 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation into five Americans in a Pakistani prison suspected of links to extremists.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargodha, in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month from their home in the US state of Virginia.
The State Department said it was also about getting information on these men.
Three of them are reported as being of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions they were detained in and the circumstances in which they were held", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and has been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their activities here and whether they are indeed the missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them.
It stated that the house had always been the focus of local police interest and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters reported, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism that is advancing in recruiting and training".
The disappearance of these five students from their home in Northern Virginia was reported by their families in late November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranian tortured.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the past 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International's human rights group.
The report details the "methods of torture" used by the regime before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One man said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this human rights report.
Officials have labeled the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been jailed and dozens killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC's Tehran correspondent John Leyne, now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had declared certain forms of torture illegal and banned them from being carried out in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, hardly any criticism of the legal authority has been tolerated, as our correspondent noted.
False confession
Amnesty International quoted a report by Ibrahim Methari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of "working with the Facebook network" and protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face", he said in his statement.
"They burned cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with execution and humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the election and tortured to death in prison, and others were raped.
Senior Iranian officials denied the rape allegations but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but said that the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were not publicly available.
The group said that at least 90 people have been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol landmark into a downhill race track.
The ski slope for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for the prize money.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski jump before a 100 meter long ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was truly depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the twinkling lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents", he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces or maneuvers on the ski slope.
After the race on Thursday night, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters are calling for a ban on minarets and alarms are being spread about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written and informed and pondered whether Muslims can integrate - and do integrate - into one of the most open secular societies on the continent.
Some readers have become admirers of the author's latest work, Why the French Don't Like Head scarves (2006), this elegant and controversial study of the issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years, and whose impact is still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious take.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the background.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now cater to the five to six million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about development and gay rights?
can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Is it a Muslim's right to use the interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It's these seemingly mundane issues that are being discussed that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that the media is engaging in.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known figures, not excluding Tarika Ramadana, an Arab Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no argument for all their habits.
Conservatives are suspicious of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists Mr Bowen interviewed tend to assume that this is the opposite of the Salafi-supporters of purist Sunni Islam, who are associated in Saudi Arabia, a small group that influences European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
He asks how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so vehemently advocate the laity) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he discovered "the screwing of values".
After reading this book, some may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now".
The Most Disconcerting Prospects in the World
The Arctic is changing more rapidly and dramatically than any other environment on the planet.
The border ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting the animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be turned to new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their wake.
In his book "On Thin Ice", author and illustrator Richard Ellis tells the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-versed in the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers attempting to capture the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a daring 14-year-old sailor who fought only with a musket ball is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who swam by the bodies of their recently slaughtered mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears were performing in one circus tent.
Even today, zoo enclosures are typically a million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wild.

Mr. Ellis draws on the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of the species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis and are all armed with powerful assault rifles that shoot their prey.
Ironically, it's taking place in waters north of these two hunting nations, and the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unflinching account of science's responsibility for the Arctic and a compelling glimpse of how the future may change it.
Not everything has scientific answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have adequate answers to the rate of change.
That's for lack of rehearsal.
Fridtjof Nansen's expeditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first suggested how floating ice occurs.
Cold War submarines then mapped the shifting front as they approached.
Satellite surveys and large field probes in floating ice caps are useful additions, but much of it is still done by the unsuspecting individuals who camp out in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the Arctic ice shelf, created by the accumulation of salt water that coagulates when it freezes.
But from the bear above to the microscopic wonders below, all of them are doomed to disappear as the summer ice shifts, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it could be us.
6,000 Marines laid a wreath at the Arlington Cemetery.
Petty Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he'd never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
"In a few months, when we embark, it could be us", Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I wish someone would do the same for me, to show me the respect I'm trying to show.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veterans' cemetery in several wards during the Arlington Piety Service.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Home in Harrington, Maine, started the tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a funeral in Arlington.
Now, in its 18th year, Mr. Morill and his wife, Karen, make the annual trip, stopping in various towns along the way to honor the memory of service members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit, they're looking for money from all over America, they're looking for money from other states.
This year, more than 16,000 wreaths were placed by volunteers at Arlington Cemetery, on the grounds of the Pentagon, on graves in Fayetteville National Cemetery, in Arkansas, in Battery Park, New York City, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to the purchase and transportation of the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she was making the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way of paying back what she's done to the victim.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Clad in warm cloth, volunteers walked through the surrounding lawns and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have been focusing on older graves from World War I and II and Vietnam because these are not visited as often as the more recent graves
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine to the found tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red circle on the top.
Nearby in Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was a real silence.
The allied service organizations had donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the ward, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some were weeping sincerely, others were praying, and families and friends were holding each other in the cool air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stones, while others stooped to see the small black-and-white nameplates pressed into the wet mud where the headstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped away tears from their eyes at their son's grave.
She's been driving eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Army Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid the price, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one who remembers him".
A U.S. government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has jailed a U.S. government contractor who was importing mobile phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The supplier, who has not been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, were searching for access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5th.
The specific charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical sit-ins, are subject to the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sanchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive the prizes, but has been denied.
The detention of the American supplier may be a result of the growing tension between the communist Castro brother ruling Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a "detention tactic" in improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report on the arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Cell phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used for texting and messaging, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a day's wages.
Internet access on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government outlets, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
An American being held in Cuba is a rare thing.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuban prisons are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, a press officer for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't give any more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - say free cell phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, program director of the U.S. human rights group that recently released a negative report on freedom in Cuba, titled "The New Castro, the Same Cuba", in reference to the installation of Raúl Castro as the country's leader and the replacement of his wrinkled elder brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a single day.
He said that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards a broader dialogue.
Pakistani officials uncover a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged mastermind behind a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters that scour the Internet looking for radicalised young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray insurgent figure known as Saifullah who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks on a YouTube video site.
Saifilla took over the leadership of these men once they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate a terrorist network.
As a result, they were driven for several days to the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the dangerous mountains in the northwest that had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The reason for the suspension was given by an official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to get permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of these five -- who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI -- highlights the critical role recruiters play in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has given top priority to attempts to deploy human resources to al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as sentinels, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits were subjected to a special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered to be of particular interest to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their publicity value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years about who to allow to join them, as US intelligence agencies have gained experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that's much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday demanding stronger climate action from the negotiators at the Bella Convention Center.
Protesters have put the number of participants at several hundred thousand, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, with a handful of masked activists planting several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying banners that read "This is not Planet B" (i.e., second-rate) in English and one in Spanish that read "Earth says 'enough.'"
Several celebrities attended, including Danish model and photographer Heleny Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided information about the country's bleak state, which is being affected by climate change, which is still happening.
That's part of the reason we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the world's leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary, it's inevitable.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bella Center, saying they detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited by Danish law during demonstrations.
According to an unnamed bystander who is involved in climate talks, the activists, disguised as athletes and dressed in black suits, laid several bombs near the main canal in Copenhagen, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated near buildings, he said, firing flares, but then followed "several large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't reach the heads of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of".
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is so large, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of each.
The focus is on the general public and the different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said to be an interference with the actions or freedom of other persons.
The data revealed persistent racial disparities
Last week's federal math test was a welcome addition to the good news about the District of Columbia public school system.
Even though the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the test scores have shown greater progress among fourth and eighth graders over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers from the National Center for Advancement in Teaching is the persistent gap in educational attainment between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in the District of Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500) in the last two years, but only three points have been increased for their African-American peers, from 209 to 212.
The gap in knowledge reached actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
African-American progress in the eighth grade remains essentially flat, with a statistically insignificant one-point variance from 245 to 245.
The average score for white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The six-year time frame is not encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-grade students in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 points on a scale (262 to 202).
Although the outcome achieved in both groups improved during this period, the difference was nowhere near 58.
Some education advocates in the district have expressed concern in the past week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were being more widely stimulated among white students where there were already high scores.
That would indicate that we've increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal pay in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down for a two- or three-point spread, said D-C Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), whose daughter is in fourth grade at an elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Ms. Rhee's style of administration, Ms. Brown said that reporting test scores means the city's high school is in desperate need of attention.
It's obvious you always want to see the good in me, and I respect that.
But what's terrifying is that we've given almost no time and energy that we needed to give to our high school education.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
As a result, for example, some teachers are being trained in the use of the new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at upper-class elementary school students and secondary school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their careers are significantly lagging behind their peers.
The day-to-day math and math curriculum for the sixth grade, emphasizing the games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former principal Clifford Janey, can be read on the progress bar of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think we should continue to work and make the best interventions for those students who remain below class level, Ms Rhee said.
Others said that the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee can continue to raise the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low performing schools, which is necessary to close the gap.
It's a particular dilemma of Michell Rhee's, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test scores in urban areas.
The conventional course of remediation is to focus resources and administrative reform on schools located in the worst parts of Columbia County.
So focus can bring political echoes that go against an important agenda.
But the blame goes to the other city directors who are trying to maintain a middle ground between the whites and the blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to consolidate the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to be provided with an excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the key to narrowing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make school eligibility a reality.
You need up to 200 days to get the change through, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers' union last year for a school year of 185 days, which he sees as a "sign" to look for a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The bus was entering the Gettysburg Railroad with a loud sigh.
Graciela Rodriguez, age 12, stepped out and, for a moment, rested on the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawns.
Graciella's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on the railroad property.
Now, she and a group of eighth graders were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their position as rather intimidated visitors than enthusiastic potential students.
Yes, that's it! shouted Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, when the guide offered them entry to the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? They said thoughtfully when they were told about the low teacher-to-student ratio.
The Pennsylvania college was one of seven they visited on their three-day trip, and now they were all caught up in the message of the future: It's not a question of whether you're going to enter the college.
The question is where.
Of course, this is a serious problem with the high number of Spanish-born immigrant children in the United States who are dropped out of college or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands who are getting a secondary education and entering the middle class.
In fact, one fifth of this "great generation" of Spanish college students - remarkable achievements that show that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, made it to the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of departure for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved a college education say they have a natural inclination to school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American schooling.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would like to go to college - especially if these efforts are sustained over time.
Given that the children come from low-income backgrounds, with parents who lack the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point won't solve the problem, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied students from the Latin American region.
We have to think about providing these kids with a catch-up network at preschool age in all the ways that they can go through college.
The federal program that funded Graciella's railroad trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparatory programs that start for low-income students in high schools and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than a third of whom have entered college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure during two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the revival of Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies have left with equity in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one submitted a losing bid.
Two American companies have reached an agreement for a field that was auctioned in June.
The bloody involvement of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans on the front lines of the road, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
That'll be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by Tuesday's massive coordinated bombings and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to deter US companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has proven third-largest reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
US companies have been disadvantaged in some cases, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, which have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading American companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and offered technical assistance in past years, have left empty-handed.
Russia's Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded later this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in bidding for more contracts than any other company and left with large shares in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the oil ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be able to compete and live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that have been pre-selected to submit bids, which have then been matched by the Ministry on price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for boosting output above current levels in each field.
Al-Qaeda's top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A top al-Qaeda operational planner was apparently killed in a US missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week, US counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets landed in the vicinity of their car near the town of Miran Shah in the North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have denied that the missiles were launched from an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed at a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, said an official with Pakistan's Central Intelligence Agency who called from Miran Shah.
The official said that local gunmen had rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said the Somali was in the afterlife.
Somali has been cited as a senior Al-Qaida military operations planner who has directed the operations of terrorist groups outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who declined to be named, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If he held such a central position, he was likely to be involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was receiving instructions from the top leadership of Al-Qaeda, and based on those instructions, he was planning possible terrorist attacks.
Another US official said the Somali had risen quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and had good connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure to some Americans, but he did not in any way humiliate himself to pose for us and our allies, another official said.
With his death confirmed, the Somali would be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top pro-perativist leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped from an average of about six operations a month to two since the summer, according to the records of the Long War diary, a website run by the nonprofit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that took steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people they suspected of being informants, the site said.
The top United Nations delegate in Kabul has resigned.
The top United Nations delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 more American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for the drawdown, which begins in 18 months, should challenge the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting in Afghanistan's political transformation.
The increase on the armed forces side must be copied on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he wasn't quitting, but was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to file a report with the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun looking for a replacement.
Officials said they were deciding between Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian who previously headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhem, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peacekeeping operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election, of masking the presence of massive election fraud.
Eide denied the allegations, but said that the indictment of Galgraith -- who was acquitted -- "definitely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he was proposing a meeting with the Citizens' Representative to coordinate the easing of the US-led effort in Afghanistan.
He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successors to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission because, he said, he wanted to build their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan, and stated that the UN's heavy-handed recruitment regulations undermine its ability to leverage capabilities.
UN rules are such that I've only had a chance to recruit one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran for its lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of the war-torn areas of Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
"This is not a good choice for Iran", he said in response to a soldier's question about the likely developments.
One of the things that depends on me, if I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, is the inevitable unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of those sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and restraints" would require "making the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer extraordinarily" from sanctions.
According to a Friday statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will face serious consequences if it fails to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Security Committee and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wishes to develop its expertise for peaceful purposes only.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to give up a substantial portion of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to be backing away from the interim accords - in part, the expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
"Frankly speaking, as far as Iran's toughness to the international community on some of the proposals that it actually agreed to in early October, I think that's brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a path that's not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians", Gates said.
President Obama set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before it returns to seeking other elections, including by monitoring what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded allegations" made by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop numbers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to assuage Kurdish concerns about the persistent depression. US officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a unified Iraq.
We don't want to leave you".
In Aging China, a Change of Course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One more child means one more grave".
Then they learned that when official government offices in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn't leave anything for the other, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-old one-child policy, which has produced two generations of notoriously bullied and pampered children affectionately dubbed "the little emperors", is threatening the country with a population crisis.
The average birth rate has dropped to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before the policy went into effect, according to UN data.
The population distribution, where the number of people aged 60 and over is predicted to grow dramatically from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is in the larger, richer coastal cities with college-educated populations, like Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples need to have children "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and the decline in the future workforce".
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden".
Gradually Calming Down
As it was written into the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever enacted under Communist Party rule.
Couples who violated the policy faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have been pushing policies that have helped the country avoid critical natural resource extraction, while human rights advocates have been condemned for pushing the policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to have abortions when they had a second child.
In addition, many couples have had to undergo sexist selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of males to females.
In the past years, population officials have been gradually tempering their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including for urban dwellers, members of national minorities and single men and women - and in 2007, they relaxed their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Population Research Institute of Peking University, said that central government officials have previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the decree detailing how to be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent out family planning officials and volunteers to meet with the couples in their homes and to put flyers under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
Reaction was lukewarm, family planning officials said.
The Grief-Grounding Response
Although officials in one rural city outside Shanghai noted an increase in couples wanting to have a second child after the campaign began, most urban districts did not report changes.
For example, Huinan City District, with a population of 115,000, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Shanghai's Caolu University, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best for the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a docility grid, the election could be irresponsible.
People in the West misunderstand the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with their first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just political.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources manager, says she only wants one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of attention for our families and everyone looked after us.
We weren't used to providing care, and we didn't really care about others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who runs the translation company, put it more bluntly.
To middle-class, dual-career parents who have reduced their birth rates, he said, to be successful is to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds view their parents as the first days of the Chilean experiment in capitalism, and they don't want that kind of livelihood for themselves, he says.
It is the child that makes the enormous demands on the parents' time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial issues of props -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a resume ready by the time your child is nine months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, says Che, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group has drawn up a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unprecedented attitudes and mutual blame -- focused again on Friday on the release of a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing the brunt of the burden in the near term.
The text, which could provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But there was important progress in the negotiations, which have come at a bad time with over 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by an ad hoc UN working group, this text subtly states how much money rich countries should give to poor countries to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers are still able to tolerate.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Sierra Club of Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, cut from 180 pages of the text of the talks to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement whereby industrialised nations could collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by the year from 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union on Friday made a hasty pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries embrace climate change adaptation -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But still, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the interviews last week.
US special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, rejected a speech demanding binding greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary ones for major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration had taken a tougher line against China than Bush administration officials had just two years ago.
The United States will not sign the treaty without major developing countries' transfer and implementation of the actions, Stern said, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern's comments came an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "communal wisdom" or "extreme irresponsibility" had led to the announcement earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, friction has broken out both within the developing world and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current fight is more about preserving individual economies than the planet, between China and the United States over their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world's most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries had become much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large emitters from acting responsibly.
It's clearly a game about the new economic hegemony that's emerging, said Ulate, who also serves as regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for the International Conservation Union.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change have indicated they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led an international climate negotiation for the European Commission, said that the push by small island nations "has created a political impetus for the entire political process" in part because they are now united and demanding action from rising economies like China and India.
The negotiations took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government could reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, and China's deputy minister, have disembarked from planes and flown through the halls of the Bella Center for a closed-door meeting and new conferences to lay out their demands, which will be considered next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people moving in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists staging nightly shows ironizing the countries they thought they were sending them, and hand-to-hand transmission of proposals on paper rather than email -- was driven by challenge.
The intensity is only an extension: almost all the key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier in the day 60 heads of state.
We've made it to the top of the charts, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the assistant secretary for global policy at the International Conservation Fund.
Heavy weights coming in.
Britain's first train at 140 miles an hour redefined this Monday's feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle cut through the darkness to signal the departure of a train that would bring about a transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and will run from Ashford in Kent to St Pancras in London, covering the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train out of London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and link the large agglomerations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The proposed proposed new roadmap for the European Union's transport policy is based on the principle of 'a single market for all' and is designed to ensure that the transport sector is not left behind.
In theory, the three main political parties have been won over to this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build the new national rail network, the inevitable competition for projects, and concerns about environmental degradation have now slowed Britain's high-speed railway construction.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company formed in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as reported by the Times.
She provided him with a detailed route map of the next planned high-speed railway.
The new London-West Midland route was designed to operate within five metres in urban areas and districts where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open country, the final route was planned to be 25 m.
HS2 also envisages the designation of three options for the extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred choice is a Y-shaped configuration where one high-speed line should lead to the West Midlands.
The line would be divided near Birmingham with one branch running from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other running north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One of the tracks should lead to Scotland.
"It seems to have been the most efficient choice", said a railway expert.
Once it's finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be cut to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open until 2025, could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour at present.
The proposals would allow trains to run at 2250 miles an hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is already designed to carry trains 400 m long, capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could be operated every hour on the London to Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to handle up to 20,000 passengers an hour if needed.
Due to capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be extended to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only San Pancras International or Euston offers such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be reached before the general election.
Even if he can get the wheels moving, the grid should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines but on existing lines north of Birmingham and keep journey times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered the crucial junction point for securing the transition from airplanes to trains, the landmark for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers paid off a £75,000 mortgage on the Tory orangery.
Alan Duncan, the Tory frontbench MP in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds by the taxpayers last year for the orangery he built in his constituency house.
The prison party spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "on rations", raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-clad extension to his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, hundreds of pounds a month in total to the taxpayers.
The General Authorities approved the demands in time and so were not heard by Sir Thomasen Legge, who was conducting the audit of the Members' expenditure.
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns two two-story country houses in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the finance department agreed with me that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is designated in the plans as an "orange grove".
Neighbors describe it as "a fun and treat greenhouse".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Committee on General Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he broke the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan exchanged a mortgage security of £27,1406 from his London estate for a house in his constituency which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan was claiming approximately 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest until March of last year.
In April his claims increased to over £1,800 a month.
The interest RBS was paying on Mr Duncan's mortgage could not have changed at this time, indicating that it was all earmarked to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, where it has remained.
The latest municipal records show that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow House leader in September after an undercover informant videotaped him saying that members had to survive on "a rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalized, you have to live on a ration and you're treated like a s**t".
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and my right and a little of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I'm not gonna do it".
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his May issue when it emerged he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the Financial Conduct Authority approved it as "may be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped hole in Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had been claiming £4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for a capital increase, which was approved by both the Treasury and subsequently the Legislature".
He added, "this is not a matter of hiding and clicking or breaking rules or anything.
It's absolutely straight down, by the book, legitimate and that's it.
There are many ways to do it that are cleaner and simpler".
Come all of you and take a close look at the Brighton Coast hut with the advent calendar.
Brighton's seaside cottages have found a new meaning in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages ducal exploitation through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, using Christmas cookies as the theme for the decoration.
The event began on December 1st, allowing visitors to tour the last chalet from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. each day, and bishop's bread and wine, provided free of charge.
Selected works included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, with the cottage featuring the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendiary priest in the diocese of Chichester and head of the Beyonde.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building?
"The idea of an Advent calendar in the huts came about as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we tried to present it in a spiritual way".
A strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, to be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, according to organizers, marched in the Danish capital in cold weather to mark the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt a deal by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, as evidenced by the current demonstrations, has contributed to the "political toll" of a failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to AFP, the incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march began, when a group of about 300 protesters dressed in black began breaking down the exhibits with paving stones and hammers.
The riot police responded immediately.
In total, police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separatist groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction", and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and in chains "kept in the streets on Saturday night" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly made their way to the Bella Center, where the proceedings were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A podium was set up for the speakers, before which a candlelight spiritual meeting was held with former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of Asian participants, including a few Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the early hours of the morning, at the urging of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand the payment of the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it's time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, and we can walk in them now, and we never could before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for a different world has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between fighting against global warming and fighting for another world".
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which contains many islands particularly vulnerable to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers say about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothing and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects its president, Georgia condemns it as a "fracas"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, with Tbilisi calling the move a "fracas".
Some 131,000 people were allowed to participate in these first elections since the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17h00 GMT.
According to the Abkhaz Election Commission officials, the voter turnout was 58% a few hours before the polls closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
Five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which has condemned these elections.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian control", said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Other than Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 people, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the 1992-93 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, Kvarčija Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to having voted for President Bagapsh, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling station at the school in the capital city of Sukhumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which boasts of beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with Bagpesh are displayed next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In the western province of Gaul, Russian officials who had come to observe the smooth running of the elections were warmly welcomed by the district mayor, Beslan Arshby.
"We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful", he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and in particular its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
"I hope your country will be recognized by the United Nations soon", said Russian parliament member Alexei Ostrovskiy, toasting a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice President Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made last year with Moscow, such as the one that allows Russia to control the railway network of Abkhazia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he doesn't support the current government or the opposition.
To win the election, you need a supermajority of 50% plus one vote.
If neither candidate achieves this result, the deciding match must take place within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming to be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers demonstrated in the afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts until December 18 delegates from 193 countries negotiating an agreement that could go into effect on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession made a calm and peaceful journey to the Bella Center, where the proceedings were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A stage was set up for the speakers, before which a candlelight spiritual meeting was held with the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, the incidents occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black cages and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing the display.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several demonstrators to the ground.
Police said that between 600 and 700 people had been arrested, and that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", an ultra-radical separatist group that had already shown its strength during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
Late in the afternoon, a policeman was injured by a brick bone in the jaw, and four cars were set on fire near a nearby squat, incidents that resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We'll focus on extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as police helicopters once again took to the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from the big German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue capes, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the early morning hours, at the call of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create a "blue wave" for a "just climate".
Today we are going to the streets to demand the settlement of the ecological debt in favor of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it's time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, and we can walk in them now, as we never could before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN convention, the movement for a different world has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice". "There is no difference at the moment between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
Oxfam has invited a number of well-known figures, such as Danish model Helen Christensen and former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to a warming climate.
In Australia, organizers estimate that some 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital, dressed in red and wearing scarves that evoked the importance of solar energy.
Several hundred protesters also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta to demand strong action on climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350" protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
The geography and history subjects will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general secondary school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview with JDD on Sunday that the subjects of history and geography will be "enhanced" as part of the reform of the general high schools, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of high school with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and the same general culture program for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the Minister, "hypocrisy must end", because according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "in fact, the best students are in it".
The ES and L specialisations cannot be sub-specialisations for the S, he continues, and stresses: 'I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complaining that geography and history are not taught in the last year of vocational schools'.
An Ifop poll published by Humanité on Saturday showed that seven in ten French people (69%) disagree with the government's plan to abolish compulsory history and geography in the S-specialization high school graduation year, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticized the abolishment, both from the left and some members of the right.
The Minister added that it was "not possible" to abolish philosophy in the Master's programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher education, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilisation on Tuesday against the project, which they say offers the pedagogical training of future secondary school teachers.
Under Master 2 (M2), they take an entrance exam at the beginning of the year, focusing on their field, and at the end of the year, another exam, to certify their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of the Master's degree and will present their students as a professor-intern during the first year.
If you add up all the internships that you'll be offered before the admissions process, you'll gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, the experts have 15 minutes to convince the public about climate change.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call announced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC), at the initiative of the Ecole normale supérieure in Ulm.
As a journalist reported to AFP, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute expert presentations that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would draw people in and make them want to learn more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organisers of the seminar, which was named after a fish from a local pond, which had been named by the students.
He said that about 20 contributing experts from different scientific disciplines were selected based on their charisma.
On climate change "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic objectives in minutes", said Jean Jouzel, who spoke to an audience of 50 people without pre-arranged notes, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed, hoping that the audience would recognise that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on a very well-prepared scientific foundation'.
Videos of these lectures will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February, and others will follow every two months.
Delays in payments: anger at prison guards, planned action
The prison guards' unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday, demanding that they be paid their Christmas bonuses and overtime, which for financial reasons had been postponed until January.
The Prison FO (2nd Guards) asked staff who will not be on duty to participate in the demonstration held on Tuesday morning outside the prison facilities to "block" them and warn them of "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for the prison guards (3rd sector) called on them to "convene a meeting in each prison and initiate a major mobilization" saying that it was "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtime and overtime for night work, Sundays and holidays" worked in October were not paid in December.
The first prison guards' union, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) to express dissatisfaction and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime hours has increased a lot in 2009 and not all of them were included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a note to the prison warden's union, assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the Minister writes in his communication.
I have instructed the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation created by the miscalculation of overtime is never repeated in the future, added Minister Alliot-Mari.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of executives who receive prestigious bonuses for performing their duties and achieving their objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for whom "there is always room in the budget".
It's a scandal, the inter-regional FO union in Marseille is outraged and announces its decision to boycott "all meetings and summonses" until the appeal.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or public holidays unless they are paid the October surcharges in December, as well as overtime, and the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is at risk.
In an era when we are given more and more work and more tasks without being given additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-level staff to pay for it, according to the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
The unions say that the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are scarce, said Ufap Secretary-General Jean-François Forget.
Obama claims he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the "goddess" of the screen Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than I receive".
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke on a special edition of ABC's Sunday night program about how they plan to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged family companion, gets his share.
"Jesus loves Bo", Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" receive a gift, according to preview footage.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's claims about the quality of gifts she receives: "Not at all, I gave you great gifts last year", she taunted the president.
That's true, of course, he was forced to agree, but then he pointed with humor at the first lady's pearl necklace, "Who gave you this?"
In this hour-long, very relaxed program with a celebrity host who has been a tireless supporter of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their least favorite gifts from childhood.
Barack Obama brought up the 10-speed bike, but also the basketball that was given to him for Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw.
I remember seeing my father come to visit us at Christmas and give me that basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until much later that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady was thinking about the dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize everything in the little house, so I lined all the furniture up against the wall instead of around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, remembers Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday is back in surgery, RTL reports he's in a medically induced coma.
Johnny Hallyday has been re-operated in Los Angeles for "injury" resulting from major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest friends, while RTL reported that the singer is in a state of artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker underwent another surgery Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injury resulting from surgery" on his herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his press office said in Paris, saying the injuries required "corrective surgery".
The singer's press office, however, tried to reassure the public that the situation was "under control" and that a new medical report would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, the main sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into a state of artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more confident, adds RTL.
The press office, when questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to 'some sources', no drain was installed in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a herniated placenta.
The operation, which had been scheduled for several days, was performed by a neurosurgeon, Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
But the doctor was not available Thursday to comment on RTL's information.
Following the surgery, Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for a post-op infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time", but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he is a "big fighter".
He called me just before he flew to Los Angeles, but I told him he was being silly, because spending 12 hours on a plane after a surgery like that is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation by stating that Johnny Hallyday "is responding well to antibiotics" and that the infection has been "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laetitia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had undergone surgery for a "tiny colon tumor" and then a minor infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every issue with his health has been heavily watched and commented upon, and fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving onstage.
In mid-November, his team had to again deny the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro 2009: the small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favourite sport
Frenchman Frédéric Bousquet, triple medallist at the 2009 World Championships in the large pool, won the 2009 European Championships in the small pool in Istanbul in his favourite event: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, the last time the jerseys are allowed, only three world records were broken, although many more were expected.
One of them was won by Hungary's Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200m backstroke and the other two by Russia's men's relay team in the 4x50m backstroke.
A great sadness for Bousquet, who was attempting to break the 50m freestyle world record he already holds in the large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, which for the first time had ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergej Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30), as he had expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record was within my reach, I'd try for it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers were wearing polyurethane swimsuits, which will be banned from January 1.
The suits have helped to set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted the same competition in 1999.
The use of the jumpsuit did not help Paul Biedermann, the two-time world champion in the big pool in Rome, who had the world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to beat the record he holds in the 400-meter freestyle (3:32.77), but nonetheless won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian competitor Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put my all into that race.
I knew I would not break the world record this time, but I was able to defend my title and accomplish my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: A slab of a Romanian sarcophagus belonging to Zol was auctioned for $1.5 million
A Romanesque sarcophagus slab belonging to none other than French writer Émile Zola was auctioned Thursday for $1.5 million, far more than estimated, a Sotheby's art dealer said.
The cost of this six-foot-long [2.0 m] and two-foot-high [63 cm] forehead, dating to the third century C.E., was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in an elaborate architectural setting, surrounded by satire and bacchantes, is a rare work, very few pieces like it exist in the world, maybe four or five", Florent Heintz, vice-president of Sotheby's Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art auction, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still going on, but it's the item that's probably the most in demand, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The tablet remained in the famous Borgia family collection in Rome for nearly 300 years, before appearing in the vaults of the French actress Cecile Sorel, who used it to decorate her private hotel in Paris, and in those of Paul Reynaud, minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the rise to power of Marshal Petain.
It stayed there in the shade for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz, in searching the Louvre Museum database, found that this tablet was part of "the remains of Emile Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart".
A aborted attempt to remove President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that conditions were not met for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who rebels have refused to grant a guarantee of safe passage.
"Following a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything indicates that there is no possibility of carrying out this transfer", said the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinos.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador Wednesday for President Zelaya has been diverted, a source at the General Directorate of Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad, the only way to give him safe passage out of the country.
But the deposed president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The coup government "successfully tried to force me to resign from my position ... they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in a frequent commentary on the political crisis that has been raging in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican embassy asked us to provide a guarantee for safe passage, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, the minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based station Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumours of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president Wednesday, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has increased security.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the coup government's stance.
It shows their marginal stance on international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who was close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his reelection, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of there, he will be arrested and will be held responsible for the crime of "treason" of which he is accused, the coup government says.
Puchistak President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In a controversial election, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelayi's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street is rising, the US trade balance is boosting optimism.
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday up, and the US trade balance showed a rise in both the US and its peers: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.4 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on "half-full".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focusing on the US trade balance sheet figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment in the United States rose against all expectations last week, with the number of job applicants reaching 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has dropped "to its lowest level this year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also fell.
The Treasury's 10-year yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year yield rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of regime supporters shout "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime on Thursday booed the wives of political prisoners who had gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, preventing another demonstration in which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", spouses or close friends of political prisoners were spat out on the street by supporters of Raul Castro's regime as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
"Down with the Yankees!", "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's supporters chanted with their fists raised against the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "ensure security".
A similar demonstration against the Ladies in White in Havana the day before, but no injuries or arrests were reported.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, police in plain clothes detained about ten dissidents who were also planning to demonstrate on Thursday for World Human Rights Day, an AFP journalist reported.
According to this journalist, the police have loaded dissidents who were whistled by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
Arresting dissidents in similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize winners, the "Ladies in White", organized an unauthorized march to "release all, according to the dissident, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider the resistance "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their arch enemy, the United States.
Miraculously, Cuban television carried a report of a demonstration on Thursday by supporters of the government against "the opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, with its Communist Party and one-party government, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of not respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A maniac stabbed an 80-year-old man to death and wounded five others in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A maniac armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in the pharmacy or in front of it, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, according to the police and witnesses.
A badly injured old man, born in 1929 died according to the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital as a result of injuries.
At or in front of this pharmacy, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
My husband, in his mid-30s, fought back and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old man died.
The second victim's life is in danger, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock", a police source said.
The gunman, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still on the Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two others, apparently by accident: a man in his 30s and a man in his 40s, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, as it all took place in the evening hours.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried on his back, said the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
According to testimonies gathered by AFP, several passers-by, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the maniac.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter in a nearby bar.
The crowd jumped, including a city policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two municipal police officers, including their commander, attempted to stop the gunman and were wounded by a fist, a police source said.
The incident took place on one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him down in a safe place and noticed a large wound on his abdomen, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, another person, about 30 years old, also with a knife wound, came in.
A man who had no identification on him was later arrested by state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the investigative department of the regional police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
Suspect assailant was transported to the hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting his interrogation.
Police sources have not ruled out his being in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six officers to take him to the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "totally out of his mind" as "all the madmen of this type whose strength in action increases tenfold".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again asks for the end of the criminal prosecution
The lawyer for Polish-French director Roman Polanski filed a new lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles, California, to stop the prosecution of his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence for a sexual offense committed 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer representing the director of the movie "The Pianist", testified before a three-judge panel of the Second District Court of Appeal in California, about the serious errors in the trial that occurred at the time of the events in 1977.
"I demand that the prosecution be terminated immediately", said Hummel, adding that the judge who presided over the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "had a chill in his back".
According to him, before the judge (who has since died) pronounced the sentence, he allegedly had to deal with the prosecutor, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, which is a serious violation of the legal order.
Information about this interview was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", from the mouth of the state's attorney, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally admitted, in late September, that he had "licked" the author's document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel's lawyer will request a hearing at which he will be able to present evidence of his allegations.
The prosecutor reiterated what he had already said in the first state trial, namely that there would be no serious consideration of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before a court ruled he had "illegal sexual intercourse" with an underage girl of 13.
He has never re-entered the United States since.
Los Angeles deputy district attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to take part in the hearing".
"Do we want to send a message to Roman Polaski and the other defendants that there is a possibility of escape?" asks Ms. Asayam.
He feels that the director "asks the court for favors and at the same time disregards its authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to decide, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Attorney Hummel was not the only one to ask that the criminal prosecution of Roman Polanski be stopped.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, has also re-applied for a stay of the prosecution.
She noted that her client no longer tolerated the perpetual harassment whenever the Polanski case came up, adding, "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland by the United States.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to a house arrest in his cabin in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible deportation.
Wall Street is ending in a stalemate, held back by a rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended Friday without a direction, the market is swayed between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Frankly, the market is very calm", said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It's still in a tight range, the volume of trade has dropped a lot, and I think it's going to stay that way for the rest of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "have helped to improve the market sentiment in terms of the stability of the economic recovery", as summarised by analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month, and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan, US consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month.
But the indexes have been held back by a new increase in the dollar's value against the euro, the highest in the last two months, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks are losing ground.
The stock market is down.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3,540% from 3,482% at midnight and the 30-year yield rose to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World is back in South Africa.
After a month of traveling across South Africa, 112 Miss World contenders are set to cross the finish line Saturday to achieve their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This is the second year that this great celebration of beauty has been held in the Johannesburg area and so far five candidates have qualified for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratara and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was great to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I have seen many things and have had many experiences! confided Miss Sierra Leone.
The contest, now in its ninth year in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, beginning at 5 p.m.
I could not have imagined a more beautiful country to wear my crown in.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm lucky to have experienced it twice, confided Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For young Ruska, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with the other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its 'breath-taking countryside'.
After months of performances, auditions, press conferences and safaris, Miss is now focused on the competition itself.
Pooja Chopra of India hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also contested the election, and Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is a woman's dream, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with a crown, Miss India says with a wide smile.
The organizers say the 59th annual event will be a celebration of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is hard to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
The candidates, like last year, participated in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on bicycles, and tasted the local cuisine.
The highlight was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a president, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will be the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup to be held in June 2010, which helped the country to promote the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with excitement.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", his son David assured us on his arrival Friday at the Los Angeles airport to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
"It's very strong and everything is going very well", said David Hallyday as he stepped off the plane he had just boarded from Paris at 1pm local time (21.00 GMT)
The singer's son, who has been acting calm, said he would be "as soon as possible" at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday due to a post-operative infection following a ruptured appendix operation he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer was put "into artificial sleep" in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was put under anesthesia by doctors at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, hospitalized for an infection following a ruptured intervertebral disc surgery performed on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a French high school play in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the orthopedic surgery and trauma department at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Caton, announced that he was flying to Los Angeles to see the singer on Monday.
The producer has strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26th at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons have declared themselves outraged, according to M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "moved too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor by telephone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I had suffered from intervertebral hernia twice myself, he added.
A short while earlier, RTL radio station reported that the singer had apparently flown to Paris for surgery without a drain, without anything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a brain hemorrhage.
But he's also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times for medical malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the medical board, Olivier Metzner, described him as "a man without scruples", who is "regularly" summoned before the medical board, and who cannot be "far from recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure "went perfectly well" and that the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so no drainage was necessary", he added.
The singer's health problems have been mounting since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour is in doubt.
It is clear that the date for the renewal of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF is raising the tone and calling on the Nouveau Centre party not to continue to use their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by Nouveau Centre party president Hervé Morin to appropriate the acronym of Giscard's former party, saying that the acronym could not be used in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to adopt the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou does not deserve to carry its legacy after extending his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, was planning to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This move was supported by Hervé de Charette (former pro-UMP now for NC), who claims ownership of the UDF trademark, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, the committee of the UDF Association, led by friend Françoise Bayrou, who has no intention of being expropriated, broke their silence and formally requested the minister and the MPs to stop using the acronym and hand back the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have made alarming statements about your proposal to your political movement to re-adopt the UDF acronym, the Association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centriste.
At the same time, you have considered it appropriate to place the name +Nouveau centre+ on your promotional material and on the welcoming website of your movement, with the slogan +UDF today+", note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF committee, which requests the NC "to immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) websites".
It also asks Hervé de Charette 'to transfer the ownership of the trade mark to the legitimate owners'.
If you do not, we will go to court to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau Centre therefore had no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the Committee continues, 'when he registered the trade mark, he had been a member of the UMP for three years, not of the UDF'.
He has used the non-existent registration of acronyms in a scandalous and fraudulent manner to do so on his own account.
This tactlessness is beginning to be transformed into a crime, they declare, and then they speak ironically about the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics as in everyday life it is more valuable to make a name for oneself than to emerge from anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name to which we have no right".
The Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of power by a weak woman.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and decide whether he took advantage of the weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which is the fault of her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision confirms that there will be a trial in what can only be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter are fighting each other for control of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, to be carried out by a panel of three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an investigation, certainly not on the terms offered by the public prosecutor's office in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time give an opinion on whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness and at what time.
I think he's going to take it.
"I will speak to her about it", said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the decision of the court.
It's a great report... but the expert will show that this old lady who needs protection has been manipulated.
It's been two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter initiated a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist, who is accused of having exploited her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or paintings by masters.
But Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the merits of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday courtroom for the lawyers sometimes turned into a family truth hour.
Ms Bettencourt's lawyer produced three letters from her client to her notary (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) expressing her distrust of her husband, Mr Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to her lawyer, adds: 'You could explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise".
The public prosecutor's office in Nanterre again found that the applicant's actions were unjustified, especially since the judge hearing the case had recently rejected her application to open proceedings for the granting of legal protection to her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in the trial, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act on her behalf", said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a representative of the prosecutor's office.
The Court ultimately decided to rule on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our struggle to develop economic intelligence has been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of management towards employees in large companies has been reminiscent of the attitude of firms towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees identify with 'values' determined from above, as it was before, when products had to be forced onto consumers that came from the ideas of factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of business, the marketing revolution has set the strategy of market conquest in the right direction...although authoritarian efforts to impose products other than customer preferences regularly return!
Passive attitude of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much wider general phenomenon affecting mainly the managerial staff.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires from all parties concerned (...) an active approach and foresight" and requires from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the incomes of authoritarian management.
That's why we're calling for a managerial revolution that aims to put workers at the center of the enterprise as much as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls - such as the questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - contribute to a revolution in management practices?
I'm afraid not. I'm sure you'll be all right.
Mainly because I've already seen for myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure, after various deviations, prefers to return to... what it always did!
And because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a very simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, now revived by the "neuroscience" of the USA and widely disseminated without any major knowledge by scientific institutions and the media.
With the possibility of "leveraging" (sic) the involvement of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos on Figaro.fr has shown that managers are only reinforced in their mechanical management position, which is not appropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of the ultimate vision of human behavior.
It is about integrating the essential considerations into all management intentions and practices: for employees, commitments to the enterprise will only be possible if they are seen as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of employee motivation is only addressed in studies of Motivation Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined score that allows them, through the image that it gives of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these factors of mobilisation, managers can control, predict and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their human resources management 'on the right track'.
This creates a fertile ground for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
In his speech in Oslo, Obama won praise from the right wing for his "just war".
The American right on Friday welcomed the speech Barack Obama delivered the previous day in Oslo, content with the fact that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner advocated the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who had initially mocked Obama's award on October 9th applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the Republican right-wing muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself has spoken about the subject of "sometimes necessary" war in her memoir, which is being published.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans want to be busy with, but it's necessary.
All terrorists must be held there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday, using the speech to explain his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think it was a really good speech, congratulating the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the president's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In some ways, I thought it was quite historic, said Gingrich during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former congressman, who some consider a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "left-wing president" remind the Nobel Prize committee members "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass on the peace prize if there was no use of force".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter for George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "citizen of the world" as he always did, but he "spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing dissenters is Bush-era hawk former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "uniform, pompous and uninspired", as reported on the website National Review Online.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
"When we wrap war in the garb of justice, we can easily justify the slaughter of innocent people", he warned.
However, the center-left press has taken a favorable view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers Obama's peace prize award premature, it called his performance "over-the-top", even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide for international decisions in resolving conflicts, fighting poverty and oppression", the California Daily enthusiastically reports.
Obama "gave the speech he needed", the New York Times said, calling it "simple and informative".
Road haulage: three marathons to a deal that saves a supply shipment for Christmas.
After three marathon negotiations, the road transport unions and the TLF, the only employer organization that stayed on, reached an agreement Friday night that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the delivery of Christmas supplies.
Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, after several negotiations that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators broke off early Friday morning in the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as the morning was over.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of meetings, starting at 11 a.m., to get everyone to agree and sign the agreement at 6 p.m.
This "would greatly damage businesses" and "risk disrupting the end-of-year celebrations", Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly rate for the lowest wage increases from €8.72 to €9.06.
It is not much, but there is a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we're going to give our members an order to no blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied", he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to concede a high wage increase due to international competition.
According to him, the lowest wage will increase by €170 per month and the highest wage by €100 to €120.
This was an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
This is an acceptable compromise, according to Richard Jaubert (CGT).
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and a report on the road transport situation in the first half of 2010, which will also allow the 13th salary issue and the modernisation of the collective agreement to be addressed.
Bussereau recalled the 'reduction of €100 million in corporate payroll taxes' which was the subject of the government's amendment to the draft budget bill for 2009, voted on by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consensus" vote.
The signature allows the agreement to be applied first to the enterprises that are members of the organisation, and later to the whole sector, in the case of an extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will be implemented "within the shortest possible time", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be slowed down by the disapproval of the employers' organisations.
The FNTR calls it a 'bad trade', as €100 million 'has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation'.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to take emergency action not as a result of a mutual analysis, but to avoid angering turkey eaters at the approaching Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
Otre said the agreement could "burial a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector" in the next 12 months.
RER A commuter trains: the weekend is cancelled, the unions are not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The disruption of the RER A commuter train line, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's talks between the unions and the RATP management on the second day of the strike have produced no concrete results on the question of claiming the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every other train will run, outside this section only one train in four.
The SNCF connection will be disrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expect more than 200 000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that 'the RATP was looking to establish links with the big department stores'.
The RER A runs west-east through the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in service during rush hour, and virtually no train ran during off-peak hours as scheduled.
As on Thursday, the people of the Ile de France were different and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, partly because of the absence of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he woke up "an hour and a half early to make sure he got there on time".
The train station of Saint-Lazare was not overcrowded, the SNCF railway announced, as more officers and security guards were expected.
RER A commuter trains operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
Further general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, to evaluate the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the management, which the unions have rated as "weak".
The RER management proposes to negotiate a special protocol for RER A commuter trains on all aspects, adjustment of working hours, career progression, etc.
But this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-earned premium, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
RATP even suspended the proposals for the premium, to the dismay of the CGT, which said that the management was 'unable to resolve the problem, whereas the tour operators and the SNCF were able to do so'.
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, the transport companies will "take a closer look at the conditions of the profession", RATP said.
Which is why the union thinks the company is "making fun of weekend travelers".
In the early hours of the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the works council in its Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in order to "calm down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after the UNSA and the Independent announce a strike alert.
The unions are demanding a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants), and are complaining about the worsening working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
RER drivers earn between EUR 2200 and EUR 2700 gross wages at an advanced stage of their career and between EUR 600 and EUR 650 in bonuses for irregular working hours and for working on Sundays and public holidays.
The Turkish justice has been melted for the Kurdish party and this decision has grave consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled on Friday to dissolve the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that prompted protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision may complicate the government's efforts to extend a hand of friendship to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a breeding ground for activities that threaten the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", Supreme Court President Hashim Kilic told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysely Tugluk, are banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in the parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than serve as non-affiliated MPs.
The decision is a continuation of the trial launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government extends a hand of friendship to the Kurdish community, offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights and trying to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in Southeastern Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations against the conditions of the detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have been turned into clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court ruling, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a major city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear-gas and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from their stretchers.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the verdict of justice only "deepened the despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We're against interference by parties.
It solves nothing, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete departure from the democratic proposals that the government has initiated, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
A nice chilly cold, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the head of the winter technical services department of FES.
But so that his employees could test and learn all the driving techniques.
This weekend, for the first time, the weather forecasters are predicting a possible event.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle the snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
Once the snow falls in Frankfurt and the temperature drops below zero, they will go to 20 so-called "big dumps", explains Brauburger.
These sections include main and through roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-fighting access, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and downhill sections such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three in the morning.
If necessary, wet salt, which is more resistant, should be sprinkled over a distance of about 600 miles [1040 km] within three hours.
So FES starts at 3 a.m. "to keep the roads clear until the traffic gets to work".
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because nobody is willing to make room for the dumpsters".
Only when there is less snow are the approach roads and connecting roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße, next.
The last priority is the side roads and byways.
Braburger knows there'll be complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians will be on the road, cleaning up the dangerous places and crossings.
The FES cannot usually take care of all cycle paths.
In Frankfurt, a special service is in place from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. to watch bridges, says Brauburger.
Because they form ice quickly, the snowplowers leave immediately when the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also be called if necessary.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a six-foot-two-inch-long animal with two strong hind limbs, an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with serrated claws, and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in Thursday's issue of Science that the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body markings.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window on the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the kin, the distribution and the markings of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we find a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unheard of for Triassic sediments, says team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of five individuals.
The find confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: "Fossils of Triassic dinosaurs are very rare, mostly found in single fragments".
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
The find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the placement of pradinosaurs is often disputed.
For example, experts discuss when lizards split into three major lines of evolution: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and birds; the "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives; and the herbivorous Ornithischia, which included such species as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapod, according to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced qualities, says Nesbitt.
For example, researchers have found evidence of air sacs on the skulls of Tawa hallae, which are also found in the descendants of theropod birds.
The air sacs make the birds' breathing more efficient than that of mammals.
At the Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
The Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air pockets, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation was probably created by a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have concluded that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of evolution split early and spread from South America to all the continents that then formed the single landmass as the supercontinent of Pangea.
It would also be a good sign if the team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods along with the Tawa hallae.
The three cannot have descended from a common immigrant ancestor, argue the scientists.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration into North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, one of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His suggestion might paint a distorted picture, because South America has preserved many primitive dinosaur fossils, while other continents rarely have any.
How dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare secondary lineage of reptiles to the ruling vertebrates on Earth during the Earth's Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, including the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread across the world and many new species evolved, while relatives died out and the Triassic and Jurassic intersected.
The success story didn't last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, which the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the reptiles didn't.
Or dinosaurs adapted better, so they could outsmart their competition.
The success story didn't last forever, anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that also evolved in the Triassic and has lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, and Berkeley, California.
We have been joined by lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police's eviction of the occupied Goethe University casino in Frankfurt has caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "do not approve" of the police intervention instigated by the presidium.
Because of the graffiti on the walls and the artwork, the university president, Werner Müller-Estler, has ordered the evacuation of the building occupied by the striking students and lecturers last week.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signatories argue, does not justify "the violent dismantling of self-organized classes by students and teachers by police commando".
The expulsion constitutes an "unacceptable interference" with the freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegitimize and criminalize protest" and distract from the content.
The Bureau has avoided a necessary discussion.
The speakers call for a halt to the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support the damage.
A justified protest
The Verdi youth union and the German Trade Union Federation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has defended the university president and the police.
We owe the university president a debt of gratitude.
Destruction and casting are completely unacceptable means, she said in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden state parliament on Thursday.
We have an understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a member of the regional parliament for the CDU.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU is using the painted walls as a pretext to criminalise the protest, said Janine Wissler (L).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, there was a dismissal.
The Linke has filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
The new Silicon Valley
For years, it paid for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a highly guarded location where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district of 216,000 people, located 23 miles [37 km] from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russia's Silicon Valley".
Major micro- and nanoelectronics research and manufacturing centres are located here.
As early as September 2008, the Greenlandic representatives established contacts with the Frankfurt Riedberg Science Centre, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits were made to each other and on Wednesday in Frankfurt, Zelenograd and Ridberg signed a "Protocol of close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was headed by the Moscow Mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Zelenograd Prefect Anatoly Smirnov, and the Frankfurt delegation was signed by the Head of Planning Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIS and of small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in scientific research will attend a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take up a foothold in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") takes its name from the forested hilly landscape in which the research facilities are located.
The Stuttgart brake
The size of a Stuttgart 21 is not at all adequately prepared.
For the project's supporters, it is simply the 'new heart of Europe'.
Well, S21 is more than a train station launch, more than a monstrous construction site that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a decade of desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, which terminated in the city centre, were considered to be 19th-century transportation-technical fossils, acting as brakes on modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to overtake the locomotives from the back to the front.
Start, stop, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the main stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the passing station, which lies roughly halfway along the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realised that in the Hessian and Bavarian metropolis, it was almost impossible to finance the start of construction.
With modern suspended trains with motorized and controlled vehicles at each end, the main train stations no longer have problems getting in and out.
However: Starting with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE line to Ulm.
State and local politicians pushed it.
The roads cooperate, partly because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer, not the state concern.
Urban design is still somehow justified.
A new urban space will be created that - if we can believe the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
For the railway system, S21 is harmful.
The passenger stations and the construction of the line are intended for passenger traffic, which - typically in the 1980s - has seen a huge increase.
There was no cheap flight competition back then.
But modern transport policy must be primarily about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep climb.
More importantly, S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Switzerland.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that the real number is 10 to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for additional nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
The Department of Transportation has 60 major projects on its list.
One of the most important is the construction of the roughly 180-kilometer-long Rhine Valley route.
Since 1987, the route has been built at a slower pace.
You'd have to put a lot of pressure on this.
But S21 will be the brake.
The Rhine Valley will become the bottle neck of international freight traffic: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport ruling
The state government has left the Wiesbaden state assembly open to whether to appeal against the ruling of the Hessian administrative court (VGH) on the night flight ban and to have it reviewed.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to assess the legal merits of the more than 400-page VGH judgment, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that the State would have to adjust the night flight ban in the event of the planned construction of the north-western runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization of 17 flights between 11 and 5 o'clock, as the state government assumes, does not correspond to the law required to protect the population from night air noise.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to seek a review of the verdict.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged the government representative to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the promise of a night flight ban made before the election, otherwise it could be seen as a "breach of the promise".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir in a reference to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbela's rebuke, the state government is trying to get through "twisting law and tricks" to his night flights.
It takes time to do a thorough legal review.
The coalition doesn't want to work on a "quick first impression".
The EU's role in the world of work is to be a global one.
His faction's statements about the night flight ban were never what the opposition claims.
American banks are paying back aid
America, shaken by the crisis, the big banks are unleashing their state bonds.
Bank of America paid off a total of $ 45 billion (about 30 billion euros) in bailout assistance from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund on Wednesday .
According to a report by the American network CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to pay back the state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with the acceptance of money - the limitation of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America raised $19 billion in net cash from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the money came from her own treasury, which was filled, among other things, by union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis specifically thanked the American taxpayer Wednesday night for the cash injection that helped us through a tough time.
The Fed hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also seeks to be freed from its obligations to the State by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, reported that the US bank could announce as early as Thursday a capital increase of around $20 billion.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, the bailout was already repaid by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
The quick choice
It just happened faster than expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender.
The guild was trying to settle a case last night.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF's studio in the capital city of Berlin.
The station didn't confirm it - not officially, so as not to pre-empt the process.
But they also wanted to avoid harming the manager of ZDF, Markus Schächter, if the proposal did not pass the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board meeting with his proposal to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
With only seven members voting for Brender, seven against, Brender's loss of the mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
The Union majority in the Administrative Council had already indicated several weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that the news ratings of ZDF had fallen during Brender's tenure.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Last time, 35 state attorneys intervened in the debate, calling Koch's action unconstitutional.
It was no use.
The person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957, in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
Then he worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal assistant to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of ZDF; since then head of the main studio of ZDF.
After Brender, who was named Medium Magazine's Journalist of the Year on Wednesday, was fired, the Greens announced they were filing a lawsuit.
Koch's opponent in the board, Rhineland-Palatinate Premier Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, ordered the board to play a clever chess move - and was strongly criticized by the board immediately after Brender's removal.
This proof of journalistic independence allowed him to nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without being suspected of being pushed into office by the party.
In party arithmetic, Frey is ranked as a left-wing liberal anyway.
Studying is getting rid of the junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the culture ministers finally arrived in the federal states on Thursday: At a conference of culture ministers and university rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, it was agreed that the examination burden would be reduced: in principle, each study module should be completed by a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students should be re-examined and a 'real and defensible rate' should be guaranteed.
In addition, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create more flexible common structural assignments for bachelor and master studies.
Earth anomalies should cease to exist.
Less tests
Since the student protests in Worm, the ministers of culture and university presidents have been talking about better education.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module will normally be completed by one examination", says the 30-page report, which is partly intended to regulate the new approval of study courses.
"The significantly lower test load", stated Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, is to "stop the development of errors that have significantly reduced the study's difficulty".
In addition, the 'demand for study' is to be the 'decisive criterion' for implementation in the future.
Both modules and content "must be rigorously reviewed" to "not unnecessarily restrict students' choice of
of the seminars".
Students should have "a right to a space that allows and encourages their own initiative".
The rules are to apply to the approval of new fields of study, after the review, but also to existing fields of study.
These need to be 're-accredited' every five years  but this means that it will take until 2015 for all the study programmes to be re-accredited.
The ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany are responsible for this and are subject to the accreditation councils established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called "strongly" on the Länder to ensure that the agencies do not have too many students and that the examination regime is not too strict.
In the individual Länder, universities and colleges have already agreed with the Land ministries on the appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should primarily be used by universities to fund consultancy programmes and student counselling, and to strengthen examination and immigration offices.
The country and the universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
In early 2010, the government plans to submit to parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Act.
According to her, only one single exam should be needed to complete the study module.
The structure of the study should be made even more flexible, with guaranteed recognition of exams from other universities and easier access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, the demands of all the study programs in the country should be reviewed.
The government and opposition were once again at odds on Thursday over the country's study conditions.
Along with the praise, the resolution was criticized.
The Juso Group of Universities called for education policy to be developed in the future not "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "they should say at least a word" about it, including the students as the persons concerned.
The future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (CHR), Margrethe Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the CHR discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Education and Science Boards (GEW), the Bonn Resolutions did not go far enough: They demanded a legal right to allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree to access the postgraduate master's programme.
Secondly, the Federal Republic must ensure that there are enough places for today's generation of undergraduate students in master's programmes with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The Federal Republic of Germany needs to employ many more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on the free access to master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Hertha Müller
Getting in and out of Germany is nice, there is almost no control...' is the opening line of a poem by Werner Söllner, who in this language-driven piece thematizes the experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but has also lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer for a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, since 1993 he has been lecturing poetry at the legendary Goethe University of Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Forum of Literature at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused a big non-literary stir last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security files".
Apparently unsure and confused, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to his collaboration as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Along with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Recruitment attempts are said to have begun in secret as early as 1971.
I am, continued Söllner, "that is, someone who did not sufficiently resist the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Hertha Müller and her unprecedented literary treatment of the mechanisms of the dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors of Romanian origin, is shaken by a case that indicates the depths and the shame of the political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In the Securitate files, secret agent Walter played a role, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of secret agent Walter on him.
"He was cutting me out" at that time in all the important points for him, says Markel.
It is my moral duty to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and to this audience, but the confession of the former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not completely surprising.
Herta Müller wrote back in July, when she read her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate.
The affected, presumably, will speculate and in some cases may even know which name is behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the Earthly, meanwhile very certain, examination of the files of the Stazi, the manipulation of the legacy of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic lighting has been curtailed and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, the National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, and the act has been issued rather slowly since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the files.
That former members of the Securitate still have a great deal of influence in Romania was evidenced by an interview after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which one of the former heads of the Securitate from Timisoara commented on the award-winning refusal.
She's a psychotic, she was only interrogated once.
The contempt of power is expressed in the most unveiled form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as with the cover-up, raises inevitable questions.
The audience's strange reaction to Söllner's confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than by the assignment of guilt and shame.
For the work of Herty Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
The Champions League saturated bet
It looked like a well-dressed sales rep had come from a cute Christmas party at which the sports goods manufacturer was handing out candy when a quarter past midnight he got into a summoned Mercedes C-Class with new coach VfBr Christian Gross in an orange sponsorship bag.
A man with a distinctive haircut... has been driven to a town he doesn't even know... for his own sake.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in play, and a drunken 55-year-old man was also a little lucky.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we will continue the work.
Or it's just beginning.
The words of a Swiss who has been involved for only three days: "Sicily we have reached the last eight", namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against relegation".
"A far more important task" lies ahead of us on Sunday.
It's important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mochuca on a regular league day.
And to avoid another obvious weakness after three fast goals by Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyaka (11.).
Drawing by lot
The Champions League round of 16-17 + February 23-24 / March 9-10 + March 16-17 will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
So the joy of the thundering entrance of Babbel's successor will be preserved.
Not just the supposed healer who, in a short time, gave the unsure professionals of Stuttgart confidence, commitment and the joy of play.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the soul healer Gross a simple-sounding successful recipe, which, under the influence of the therapist Babbel, proved no longer effective.
He was smiling some magic, admitted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when there's a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after a break of several weeks due to an injury, has become the best player on the field thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed with the proverbial "fresh air" and the work methods of the new boss: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in this situation".
Babbel was clearly missing it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability, though.
Like Gross, neither the players nor the managers want to overstate the victory against the weakened reserve and totally overloaded defense of the Romanian host.
They would have won in Glasgow, too, before the ugly wake-up call of a 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira muses.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded us that while we have achieved one goal this season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not done yet.
Heldt's failure to celebrate his 40th birthday, after his first home win in three months, was due to the weekend's events, which came to life in the form of a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the game.
There are decisions that are made by others, not Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He was passed over for a weak leadership and decided to change coach after pressure from pubescent fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the games, Lehmann said, was a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's remarks "are the expression of pure egoism", Heldt said, and announced the consequences for the goalkeepers.
I don't think either of you 40-somethings are gonna have any fun anymore.
Anyway, they agree with the others that without the work of a well-trained coaching staff, such a strong and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great deal of success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
The heavyweight championship of the world.
The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world champion Vitali Kliček.
However, after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight division of the WBC boxing organization.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Vitaly Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson in Bern on Saturday night by a unanimous margin of 120:108, 120:108, and 119:109.
Klička is the third successful defence of the title since his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was a two-time WBO and WBC World Champion.
Unfortunately, it didn't go as well as everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice losing due to injury.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th match.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Bern arena, Klitschko, 6 feet 8 inches (2.02 m) tall, was leading the fight with his left hand.
Johnson, who was 11 centimetres shorter and had announced the end of the Klitsch era before the match, was pulled back by the world champion's punches, so Klitsch could not deliver the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
The passive Johnson did very little to the challenger and was just trying to get to the next round.
Klitschko may have provoked words and gestures, but his punches rarely hit the world champion.
But he's only the second boxer since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to fight Klick for 12 rounds.
The challenger had caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He called Klitschko a "hideous zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked to pull Johnson's sunglasses out of his nose "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth win since the return of the Klick
Kličko remained undefeated after his fourth match on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerians Samuel Peter in Berlin to regain his WBC belt, which he had previously surrendered without a fight.
He defeated defending champion Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and I'm in good physical shape, justifying Kličko's quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four of the family's important titles.
Brother Vladimir is the World Champion of the WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt is worn by Briton David Haye, after he took down the 7ft 8in Nikolai Vulaev in November.
Haye dropped a fight against Klitschko this summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promoting company is reportedly planning a match against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Opposition leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar for misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left Party are calling for an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the Kunduz raid, the opposition believes that Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said "knowingly untrue" about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, said the head of the Green Party, Jürgen Trittin, on the ARD news show "Tagesschau" on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual phrase: "Lied".
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the gist of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not just about destroying hijacked trucks, but targeting two Taliban leaders.
The American air strike, called for by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, killed or injured 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, SPD and the Left called on Saturday for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak to the Bundestag immediately and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the German Bundestag's Afghan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, urged Jürgen Trittin and fellow Green party member Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm has firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were raised about the Ministry's account of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both of them informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
The official story was that they were supposed to deny the existence of the NATO reports and withhold sensitive details from the minister.
But it was reported from the surroundings of the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defense to several reports, among them a two-page document by the commanding officer, Colonel Klein, and one report by the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert should have asked for clarification in the meantime.
It is noted that he has not yet received any reply.
The ministry declined to comment on the complaint on Saturday, indicating that the matter will be dealt with by a Federal House committee of inquiry to be appointed next Wednesday.
The worlds of dreams
Some in the waking state see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or the drug addict who blur the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, it's all good.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest imaginings and fantasies.
But the person who experiences a dream state in waking life and sees and hears things that others do not see and hear is generally considered a fool or a drug addict or at least a freak in the Western world today.
But such images and voices are not produced only by the mentally ill or by drug addicts.
Wine has our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paint paintings, or write novels, here and there, ensure that the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality merge.
Dreams, altered states of consciousness, can take many forms, at best called visions, at worst called delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of the brain's neurotransmitters - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is upset and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions are very common in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "the great similarity of hallucinations with dream states", and for Sigmund Freud, dreams were even "psychosis, with all its nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's the fall of 2001, and Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and vividly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red faces, cherishing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery boots, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threatening from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand the voices that insult and abuse him.
Henning T. rips two wires from the stereo, wraps them in a loop and attaches them to the hook on the ceiling.
He's stepping on one of the loudspeakers and putting a noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The cord allows.
Teach him, the chorus of voices shouting, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Henning T. is 40 years old today, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
They were triggered by LSD.
He's been diagnosed as schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, and he's on anti-depressants, and he's on mania, and he's on schizophrenic.
He's learned to live with his illness, been married three years.
In psychosis, he says, he experienced the worst fears and the deepest doubts.
The ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people will have schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and it's the second most commonly treated condition in psychiatric clinics, after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected person is usually unable to distinguish between the internal and external worlds, and is in a state of hysteria that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, delusions of relationships, or delusions of persecution.
Hearing voices is especially common - voices that command, comment, or lead dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The affected person is unable to distinguish between what's important and what's not, the brain can't filter out distracting signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens a floodgate to thoughts and fantasies that originate from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Clinic of General Psychiatry at the University Hospital in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he becomes passive, he becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
They are unable to relate to reality, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is out of the question.
To have a hallucination for once in your life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchss, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Delusions and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience occurs in a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzling over just why our brains do these things.
Exceptional circumstances can cause a person to lose touch with reality in the short run, says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant.
Scientists believe that the brain damage is minimal.
We think that early in development, there is damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example, from a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy", explains Fuchs.
But it's a mystery how a neurological disorder can develop that hasn't been seen for years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a predisposition to it.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains are boiling
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive hallucinations as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his findings in a book called "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are a common symptom of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other illnesses.
In addition to psychological disorders like borderline personality disorder or depression, there are also often diseases like migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person can hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to Kastens, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when parts of the brain that process sensory perception are over-activated or under-repressed; when our brains are clogged; or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of the people surveyed reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends a local gymnasium.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the pictures and the voices.
At recess, she may be approached by a long-haired, dark-haired, horny man.
When she answers, the other students look at her in surprise - no one but her can see or hear this boy.
These chicks think you're a dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
He's awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
She can even sense his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a good feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and they disappear again.
At night, the visions are more disheartening.
Often, the delusions are a burden.
When she is in class, she cannot keep up with the lesson because the teacher is introducing the new student to her eyes and ears, while the teacher explains the mathematical equations audibly and visibly to all the others on the blackboard.
At night, the sights are more depressing.
As she waits in her dark room for the sleep that comes so rarely and too late, she can't often tell if she's awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her hands and feet, are coming to her with her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends, they'll think she's crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted Kastene's psychologist online, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusions are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or deprived of stimulation, they are more likely to hallucinate, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn't have enough to do and is looking after its own amusement.
Sarah K., the only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing by herself.
Her hallucinations began when, at 13, she learned that the man she had called her father since she had been thinking was not her real father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain areas that process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between hallucinations and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, and reality is reflected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real".
Kasten also sees night dreams as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucination as an extraordinary ability.
The borderline between dream and hallucination
In our world, which is too focused on consciousness, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a hard, painful disease, but it also brings a positive, creative -- delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard was investigating what he called the oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness into a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the affected person believes to be real and cannot even distinguish them from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When threatened with the loss of the world and of oneself, such as a permanent, complete inability to move, one replaces the life-threatening real situation with one's own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Because it's impossible to handle a situation in reality, the worlds change, but the real situation becomes present in the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory conversion into some unbearable situation that allows us humans to have our own ability to form, to go into a moment of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even in later memories
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of the Heart) as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery and a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness took a trip of several days while his body lay motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen has immersed himself in a world he has created, visiting strange times and places: he becomes an old man confined to a bed in a train sanatorium, with a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility who make drugs from blood.
He's abducted by a Greek on a motorcycle to his homeland, surfs for a company in the Alps on his hospital bed, and meets a Korean mobster.
He's immersed in the imaginary, everything is real, even in his memories.
These inner paths for Claussen are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, describing your experience.
Unlike dreams, memories from those mental pathways are still vividly clear after years and in insignificant detail.
Even brighter and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug addiction show how fragile even in the waking state our inner images of external reality are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow may come
The Burda
The 27 are to take over the publishing house.
The new manager of the Kallen publishing house is a temporary solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company is to remain 100% family-owned.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for the long term.
Both children will inherit at 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, the 69-year-old man tells SPIEGEL.
We worked out the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is raised only afterwards.
I wonder if they have the ability.
You can't put your children in charge of 7,500 employees unless they're capable enough.
That would kill both the children and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was stepping down as chairman of the board in January, and named Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the board of directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury, the responsibility for the company's assets was added, and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also Direct Marketing, Cizina, Tisk and Finance.
For the first time, no family member is in charge of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died several years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to "snap 10, 15 years", said Burda.
The holding company should be 100% family-owned in the future, says Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not guaranteed to fail: 'It has always been the case with companies that have been infected by the desire for capital, that have been speculating and thinking that they can become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power", claims Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer was, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these deals are too big.
The Complex Beauty Care
Everything you could possibly want in the realm of beauty and comfort is within your reach.
El Corte Inglés has done so, having just opened a Callao (Madrid) shopping centre of over 1000 m2 offering a wide range of personal care services.
The wellness area is located on the eighth floor, where prestigious companies such as Hedonai, dealing with laser hair removal; Spaxión, relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and others.
There is also a food service and a teahouse, which serves over 130 different kinds of tea.
You and your partner can enjoy relaxation massages while enjoying the view of the capital, you can rent a relaxation zone for two hours and arrange your own 'beauty party' with up to eight friends, relax in the spa, have a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of the variations of Spaxion.
The total area is 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, where the above services are provided, as well as the most modern facial and body care procedures and hydrotherapy.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
Endesa Energy, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created 'Office LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will set up and manage the urban electric car introduction roadmap and arrange mobility agreements, arrange, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, and collect views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to join the electric car project in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are the three cities selected by the government under the MOBELE Plan to promote the introduction of electric cars.
The energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose of the aid is to support research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
This includes energy-related activities and, in particular, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa's participation in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented on European standardisation teams and is actively implementing a number of additional projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a "quiet period" for the car industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automobile industry, the main export sector of the state, is facing a 'quiet period'.
In the 2009 Economic Report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
'Without the Competition Plan for the automotive sector, we would be facing a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing enterprises,' the Prime Minister stated.
'Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm is foreseen for the industry, which is our main export sector,' he added.
In this respect, it noted that the Competition Plan, which is part of the Automotive Industry Integration Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 supporting companies, which mobilised investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the governmental measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car brands.
According to the President, the plan reduced the average emission levels of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and ensured a 'significant increase' in registrations, namely by '40%' in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will open in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the motoring world.
The initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition area covers 20,000 square metres and will be home to more than 200 exhibitors from both the country and abroad.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find all kinds of products related to the world of motorcycles.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will be offering accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc. The exhibitors will also be offering accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc. to the public, and will be offering accessories to the public, including the following:
Hundreds of products relating to classic engines, a true treat for collectors and connoisseurs.
The firms involved will be the following: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialised firm of Mercedes Benz.
External fitness tests
In addition, the commercial activities of the salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of seminars, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
The same will be done for the suitability tests for classic cars and motorcycles in the adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
The Mazda3 i-Stop: keeping the sporty style
Mazda is going to show that being eco-friendly doesn't have any negative impact on sportsmanship.
And that's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also called a Stop - a device that's currently only available with a 150-horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 has the good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
The finish, the vehicle construction, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent in the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomie and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely delicate.
Using the toolbar and console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend of developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
So we can say that the Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of the German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this compact Japanese product offers more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it should be mentioned the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and a 150-horsepower six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat, very gentle, with a reduced noise level, its power and lower consumption.
Even though the most popular Mazda3 is a diesel version, all those who do not drive that many kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater ride comfort and reduced consumption.
As regards equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of standard elements.
For standard equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the RVM system, which prevents the formation of a blind spot, the thrust and stability control, the speed control, the internal mirror sensitive to light, the on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and bluetooth audio and the 17-inch alloy wheel.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with a Premium Pack, for an extra €1,500: adaptive bi-xenon lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its class.
It is characterised by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of its equipment.
And for people who don't drive more miles a year, they can opt for this i-Stop version, which is only a 2.0-litre petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR 21 770 for the Luxury version and EUR 23 270 for the test version -Sportive-.
For this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
The luxury of the 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet as soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were shining more than ever in the new stylish and sexy 'Nine' models.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, has chosen a dark 'lady'.
Slib of the FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only used to view mail, with no ability to view a specific type of attachment or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see it outside, but it's an interesting idea, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, the Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for a data plan, for example, the iPhone.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is designed exclusively for Twitter, the other based on a permanently provided free data service, for which however, you have to pay six times the amount for Peek.
The FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It's as limited as its American counterpart, but it's surprising.
The monthly maintenance fee is approximately EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People who travel with smartphones already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or to look impatiently for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a phone connection) to check their mail.
The idea of fixed-price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, you'd need a Ph.D. in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission has consistently called for roaming charges to be reduced so that they are available for the whole of Europe, which has not yet had the desired effect.
There are legitimate concerns about data services being used outside the home country.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (interestingly still called Fon, since it has no WiFi) can reach this type of tariff means that operators are beginning to think differently and to consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it offers downloading books and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications, you know?
This device is connected and paid for when you buy it, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen someday with FonPeek, which is a perpetual access purchase option like what Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'll check my mail on my phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's the best kind from a consumer standpoint.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The color that Michelle loves.
Yellow is the undoubted favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
She chose the dress and the coat of Barack Obama for the inauguration of the President of the United States, and the same color she chose to accompany him to the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that they were the same color - yellow-green with sparkling effects - in both cases, the three-piece set - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric - was decorated with a large pendant or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States had decided to follow in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and wear similar clothing.
The material from which the clothes are made makes both models quite different.
On the occasion of her inauguration, Michelle wore a large crocheted Oslo velvet print.
Changes and accessories: green shoes with medium heels, similar to the current model, but in gold.
She's also wearing different hairstyles: this time, down, before, loose hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who are about to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and the working career of Spanish women' carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study highlights that there are many differences in views on the number of children at the beginning of a partnership, depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have no stable job, live with their partner earlier, have their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, delay both cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer children.
"Women aged 35-49 with stable jobs have their first child on average 3.7 years after the start of their life with their partner.This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their lives to achieving stable employment and have therefore had to postpone both their life together and the arrival of their children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on motherhood, although it has a smaller influence on the time of initiation of cohabitation with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and childbirth is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the education level, the higher the age at which women get married and have their first child.
Differences also exist between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, women with basic and higher education had their first child at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with a primary education marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education, on the contrary, prefer to obtain stable employment before marrying and having their first child", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it, too.
L'Oreal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious roster of celebrities: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of the brand's various products under the universal slogan 'Because I'm standing behind it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins the ranks of other celebrities of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.
Before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the slum') joined this select club.
The men's section of the cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelina's partner in 'Lost').
The price of British fashion

♪ I'm not gonna let you down ♪
In 'El poker de los dados' (Alfaguara, illustrated by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he has met in his literary life (and in some cases in his everyday life).
He does not do so in the dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something like the core of a creative personality.
The road brings excitement, and Vicent spares no effort or inspiration.
This book is an excellent pleasure to read, even when read over and over again.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book I have found that Middle-earth is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but cannot name it: the pleasure of the contrary fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god".
Of Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, writing from his own nature and not from his intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with a blindingly poetic humour, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that had almost killed him".
Of Graham Green: "Our man has been driven by passion to this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by way of damnation".
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey, published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, is one of the eight thousand peaks in the universal literature which must be surpassed from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall".
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He called himself the heir of a county landowner, and sometimes the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both were big dreams".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer has captured on the bridge the mad cry of this man from Munich, to carry its echo into the night of the 20th century in its literary form, fleeing from itself and calling to the future and speaking fiercely to worms".
Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt and prayed, 'My God, my beloved, command me to cease writing as a woman.'
Of Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After toil comes a dream, / after a storm a calm harbor, / after war rest, / after a full life death.'"
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression with him.
My husband agreed with her wholeheartedly when she told him that Edward VII had followed her among the Azalans or that the birds sang in Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and so in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness".
Of Pío Baroja: "What else was Martina Santos after than to target Joyce on Baroja?
What else was Bennett up to besides having Barrow executed with Faulkner's gun?
What was Celo's purpose in making himself famous at the expense of that man's glory?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of youths between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by while our dog, a rescued shelter-bred hybrid weighing up to six kilograms, was kicked twice and badly injured without a word.
Our indignation is compounded by the fact that we see no amusing in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal, who was on a leash.
And in addition to the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, she began to fear for her own safety, because such a demon-possessed person who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old person or anyone weaker than himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
Pejsek cried all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint with the nearest police station, but we doubt that it was worth it, and to avoid raising sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Our outrage has forced us to announce this fact.
We don't understand what's happening to today's youth when they're amused by tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't understand what happened to good manners, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among young drivers, both organisations said today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet as the only means of preventing head injury and possibly death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of its commitment to road safety, which 'means more than designing and producing even safer products', and confirms that it is also trying to achieve this objective in other ways, i.e. through an instruction and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be fitted with signs to raise awareness among the general public.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not provided any evidence that the Commission had used the same methodology for the calculation of the injury margin.
Light commercial vehicles are increasing in sales
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to recover.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12.6% compared with 2008, and what is more, it is the first increase after 22 months of sustained decline, according to figures from the patronage organisation of manufacturers Anfac and dealers Ganvam.
However, a positive figure is better to put in quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and marked a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, small trucks and light trucks/crossovers.
And the clouds that are the biggest drain on demand have not disappeared either, even though they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized firms and almost 100% of the purchases are financed through third parties.
In addition to the constraints resulting from the closure of the bank credit source, there are other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, there are also those who are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of transactions has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again reminded us that special attention needs to be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association expects the trend in 2010 to be similar to last year, with sales of passenger cars and 4x4s estimated to fall by 19%.
The brake assist system is already mandatory.
As with the ABS, ESP stability control, and manual brake systems will all become mandatory on European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the others, the deadline for removing the deficiency is set, which is February 2011.
The EU measure aims to improve pedestrian protection and works in such a way that it can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary hand brake system shall increase the pressure on the brake in an emergency, which the system shall detect after the driver has stepped.
But it doesn't always manage to keep that pressure up to the end.
According to a study by the automobile parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers who have an accident fail to apply the brakes before a collision, and half of them fail to use the brakes to their full potential.
1,100 accidents in all
On the contrary, this aid requires the braking system to its fullest extent, and shortens the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1 100 pedestrian fatalities could be avoided annually.
The reduction will be even more significant - by calculations one in four personal injury accidents would be avoided - following the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system which (using radar or camera) detects and reports obstacles to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver fails to react, even if a collision cannot be avoided, the device shall apply the brake with the greatest possible intensity and minimise the risk of damage.
General Motors is delaying its Opel plan until January .
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to meet the renewal plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every single part of the plan approved by the party concerned first.
As a result, the final document, which will be presented first to the employees and then to the governments of the countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued as late as the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in the near future.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM is providing contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg group.
In the event that it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains in force if the sale fails.
Riding in a Porsche Boxster Spyder with a motorcycle
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a base and succeeded in reducing the weight by 80 kg, so that the weight is only 1,275 kg.
The first was based on the automatic retractable roof in the manual-controlled canvas design, which reduced the weight by 21 kg; furthermore, aluminium doors such as the GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of the air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to a further 7 kg reduction in weight; after the installation of sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to the lightened 19-inch wheels of five kilos.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with fabric handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a two-speed PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-crank six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on California second-class roads, on mountain sections with many twisted corners.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Reducing weight does not mean that the vehicle will not press against the asphalt.
Quite the opposite: we have not tested a model so small and light that can also provide such safety in cornering, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete capable of warming up muscles on short rides for the time needed until we can instruct him to sprint, brake, and restore engine performance...
Whatever we want, and with a steering that's as communicative as it is precise, whatever we put our hands on the wheel, that's what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The V6 boxer, with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very responsive and can be amplified by the 'sport' option and by a system that modifies the engine sound that was already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it's suction or recovery.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads we drive on the Boxster Spyder are pretty run-down, but the car handles the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the drive; and in some corners we ran into frost and gravel at dawn, even in the late morning.
This ultralight is definitely one of the most fun cars on the market, because it's more than just a modified Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 for €70,831.

Baskonia has won a victory in Israel
The team won a brilliant 82-91 victory on the complicated Maccabi Electra pitch, despite numerous absences in Dusk Ivanovic's team, and thus came to the head of their group after a great performance by Mirza Teletović, who was declared the best in the team with eight triple points (29 ratings).
The team of Vitorie was able to compensate for the significant absence of Hermann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
Besides, the great precision of the 16-point triple was a big part of the final triumph.
The match began with a face-off for the blue team, who had been on the mark from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets for Vitorii were from a distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the leading scorers 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for an inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with applause and applause upon returning to his original position to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already emerging as the best player in his squad with 13 points, although 'less than six' in Splitter's rating already suggested that it would not be the best night for the Brazilian.
But even though the match was fierce until the break, it wasn't decided at all, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitori that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by the hand of Elias' they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the return of the 'yellow' to the slope (50-49).
More inappropriate
The Ivanovians, wounded but not dead, needed a few precise shots to catch their breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which, with three triplets almost in succession and with the help of Englishe and Ribas, returned the score to a comforting score (54-67), which the locals achieved at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavas were fighting hard in the last half and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not let anyone take away their well-deserved results from the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their squad, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and Splitter being sent off for foul, the Selvanovics were in no hurry and defended well, and although the Israelis came on in the final minute (80-85), the match was already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
The wounds make Unicaja unable to fight.
Unicaja suffered a heavy defeat in Greece against Olympiacos, leaving him in the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks from Unicaja (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) and an in-house play that helped the Greeks to victory.
The Malague team is not afraid of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, or the rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a big budget.
The first-quarter play gave Andalusians a dream, with an aggressive defense and three straight 3-pointers, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillaume Rubia, lighting the field with 12-18 in the ninth.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the local arsenal in the home game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the USA's support from Beverly and Williams meant the elimination of both players.
The Greek team started to work and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and the three personal errors of Carlos Jiménez weighed down the Unicaja team
Between the inside players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleisas with a triple point increased the lead to 44-32, minute 19.
The impossible retaliation
The third half was very aggressive on the part of Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to make up the difference from the match in the Mala Mala Mala 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja were trying to overcome the absence and the final absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages, thanks to the lead and the triple points of Cook and the contribution of Lewis, Unicaja had a good chance of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, with reinforcements and a lead in the centimeters in his zone, proved to be unstoppable.
Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to level the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja won and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you be collecting for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get to know the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads in the real estate, employment and motor vehicles sectors in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates user salaries based on the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you need to enter your profession, years of experience, age and city where you wish to work.
Within a week of the app being up and running, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels badly paid", explained in his report Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.

Brazil has set a date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has fixed the length of stay of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that after the end of his term on January 27th, he must leave and seek refuge elsewhere".
The station also quoted a former diplomat who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week, he attempted to gain asylum in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the political asylum condition that the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti tried to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses of last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state of affairs in an environment where decision-makers are making decisions about a future that is itself uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise the market was the monetisation of debt by direct purchase of assets and the indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets for write-off.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are virtually over, and without questioning their unconventional liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand in the water, as the Bank of Spain did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a return of reduced risk returns.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have gained points again, although they are still far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
The focus on quality is re-emphasized, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the investors' chosen havens, thus widening the differentiation of the eurozone countries against Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the downgrading of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not unnecessary to silence the advocates of moral hazard who have tried to re-burden the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy by curbing the destructive effects of credit-to-employment curbs when in fact a new Thanksgiving would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirates to restore power in the emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections, and a new government comes in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
There is no point in Ecofin bailing out Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and allowing a euro member country to default on its commitments.
But the logic is that Ecofin should force the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its citizens to shared responsibility in the event of emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalisation of the transitional risk premium, some excesses on the supported positions would be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, while our public debt differentials will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If European differences are reduced and ours continue to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's affair is just an anecdote, when our leading indicators force most services to anticipate their recovery scenario and revise their 2011 rise scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not hold much hope for the Spanish economy to live up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it's going to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now, "be careful, fellow drivers".
Related sectors
Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to speak yesterday before a subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where he is currently discussing Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, which was followed by the speech of the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave some remarks to the press on the proposal he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50 million by 2020 and a further EUR 60 million from that date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are to be maintained.
If that were not the case, the investment required would not be 60 billion but 95 billion.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the measure is selective.
From 2020, the question is changing and we will need to increase performance.
Its offer is focused on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and mainly on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that 18 000 MW are needed, but with different 'supporting energies'.
Galán, who believes the Sustainable Economy Bill, which the government has just passed, is in line with what the company wanted, did not want to be seen as a royal decree to promote national coal consumption, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, the 'long-term stakes are clear'in this sense, despite the 'precise' measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken now, because they are still maturing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial won the 'handling' of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's airport ground handling subsidiary, Swissport, will act as preferred partner for Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet expired, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castilian-La Mancha Government and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create a hub for innovation in intelligent infrastructure
The grouping envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will be borne by Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to research energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona is aiming for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water utility.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated to cost A$1.7 billion (about $1.047 billion).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
A 5 km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction and concession highway company.
The mayor wants the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting public-private partnership (PPP) for further development of the project in the Erns & Young business plan, the administration has a final list of candidates for construction and toll operation.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an estimated investment of AUD 1,700 million (EUR 1,047 million) and three companies with a significant presence in European construction competing in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia's largest construction companies, and the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against Acciona, the Northern Direct group is involved, with the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final group to go through the network is LBRJV, which is owned by the Australian company Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), the local company Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the major civil engineering company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big construction and privatisation, but it carries with it a clear difficulty of entry other than through acquisitions of local construction companies.
The strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger is, apart from the Asian references, still the model for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS gained market power through its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Million of assets
Acciona is investing in the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supply activities and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and operate desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
It now plans to consolidate these two areas and use the combined energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructure.
A toll road, promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link, is to link the Western Highway from Toowong to the Circular Route at Kelvin Grove (see map) in a 5 km tunnel, the largest such action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the local government plans the assignment for summer 2010 and the start of work for December of the following year.
Although the toll road would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the work is not planned until 2016.
The tunnel was started in 2005.
It will include two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Hochtief Australia is still making a significant profit, as it announced a $154 million government contract yesterday.
The ACS holding company will operate the national fibre-optic broadband network infrastructure through its local Leighton subsidiary.
This will enable 400,000 people to access the Internet at speed and provide a German company with 18 months of work.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the project to build a 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane, with construction work just about to begin, and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, in Manchester, it will be involved with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
The FCC has been awarded a $64 million tunnel in Slovenia.
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, obtained a contract for the construction of a 2.1 km tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, worth EUR 64,5 million.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after the completion of the tunnel extension work in Bosruc (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its expertise in tunnel construction.
The start of work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore has gotten an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the last two years to the Rushmore agency for approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway operator informed.
The contract includes the possibility of a 12-month extension each year. Ms Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that had appeared in the competition organised by Renfe, of which four made it to the final, including TBWA, which had been responsible for the creation of the advertisement for the past three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
French Telecom fined 63 million for hindering competition
The French competition authority fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean, which belongs to the country.
According to the Commission, the operator has restricted fixed and mobile phone competition by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes with consumers on the fringe of regulation.
This former French monopoly and still state-owned company has been fined more than €560 million since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that, therefore, there has been a recurrence.
Application business
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the outset, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since the beginning
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since earned 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth highest earning clubs in the competition.
Manchester United is leading the table.
Manchester United is the leader.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a glorious feat, it's also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has distributed EUR 5 362,5 million to 105 clubs (including 12 Spanish clubs) which have participated in the event since its inception in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money earned for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan, who won the main prize three times.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the now-defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the standings.
The list is headed by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that additionally charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that's despite the fact that she lost both times to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to have earned the most money through Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution of
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated method of allocation used by UEFA.
For the current financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, is planning to make €1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA allocates 413,1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (other than Atlético Madrid) received 2,1 million.
In addition, those who did manage to attend received 3.8 million for their attendance alone, plus another 550,000 euros for each match they attended.
There are also prizes for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team).The eight finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists3.3 million.
Each of the final four gets 4 million.
The champion will earn $9 million, while the runner-up will earn $5.2 million.
So, on the fixed payments, the club will make a minimum of $7.1 million and a maximum of $31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won €2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million is earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and it has four assigned places.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the allotted money, second gets 30%, third gets 20% and fourth gets 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches played in that year.
Nueva Rumasa is offering €61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday announced details of a share purchase offer, with the help of which it wants to gain the top spot between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage shall not be binding for the public offer to acquire (option) all the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share to pay over ten years and for which it would pay interest for this delay at 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos's shares closed at €1.85, so the Nueva Rumas bid is valuing the company at 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real value of the Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a 15-day period to notify their intention to sell their shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase were to be made, the price would reach 611,7 million, while the capitalisation of Sos is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce continues to change its pipeline structure.
In an attempt to keep the company on the sidelines of possible bids and settle the litigation of its former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in a food company.
It's a newly created position, reporting directly to the group president.
And it's not without controversy, as the company continues to be mired in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than $230 million from the S.O.S. to the Salazar brothers' companies.
In fact, the possibility that the SOs will discover new transfers of funds in the coming months cannot be ruled out.
As for the Salazar loan, former board members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified yesterday in the National Court and confirmed that they had authorized the transfer of 212 million without knowing where it was going.
CNMV authorises the option of excluding Paternina, which was involved in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday allowed the exclusion of Inversora Mer from the list of Federico Paternino on 9 October.
The Authority explained that it authorised the operation as it understood that its conditions corresponded to the applicable standards and considered that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December was 'sufficient'.
The CNMV specified that the offer was aimed at acquiring 550 008 shares of Federica Paterna at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8,95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were frozen and that they could not be transferred in any way until the offer was closed, specifying that the price had been set by Federico Paternino according to the provisions of the applicable norms.
New tools for car valuation
These days of storms and accidents, it's not just the auto parts companies that make money.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance accident are towed to the repair shop, where a specialist must estimate the damage and the cost of repairs.
No insured event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and the time of manpower can be a long and complex job.
Calculating the cost of a repair by hand, from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
The service and maintenance estimation solution providers are engaged in collecting information from manufacturers in order to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain, Audatex, of the US Solera group, is the leader; 80% of the evaluations are carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been reported in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once a new vehicle is on the market, these companies start working.
This is a very demanding job, since each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be catalogued and its price determined.
In addition, each model is equipped with 'intelligent' graphic processing, where individual parts of the tourist cars can be 'pictured'.
For a mass-market model, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it may take three or four months.Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information on are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
The vehicle fleet in circulation exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database work, Audatex has eight centres spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each specialising in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, over a hundred technicians (normally mechanical specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million pieces of data are collected every month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information allows businesses to make different uses and provide different products.
The most common use is in repair and maintenance, but there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sale or residual value of a car, depending on the country.
The only undertaking which has a guide to the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not available in our country, but in the United States, it is.
The products offered by Audatex make it easy to obtain support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different instruments, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standardised valuation solution for insur-ance events, designed for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the varnish company.
This tool applies for each assessment according to its use.
The top price is €5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which makes thousands of estimates, negotiates their price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it left the assembly line, based on the first number of the chassis only.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet, which allows to discard vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or detecting variations by brand or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance accidents during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer's times.
Gt Motive is a Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for damage, accident or vehicle maintenance
The Gt Guía valuation is its historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 consultants and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and accounted for EUR 10,8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalisation started with the opening of the Paris office.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 service stations, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares are estimated to be worth a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
The following information shall be used for the purposes of the procedure set out in Article 2 of this Regulation:
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation involved a subscription of EUR 59,5 million of 85% of the company's capital, which could be increased by the remaining 15% in the following year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively reserved for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, loan companies, service companies, spare parts sales and professional dealers who must register before commencing operations.
The platform was created in Germany in 1996 and manages over 650,000 transactions across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been discarded cannot be put back into service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Historic vehicles may be allowed to operate even if they have been retired after a preliminary procedure.
Four-step budgeting for the service
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets the budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding the spare part, creating the budget and generating the budget.
Ease of use is a key requirement for these systems, especially for convincing older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you'll need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour costs, bonuses or discounts, and then print them out and hand them to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not involve a labour force estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working on making these views three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it allows you to, for example, pick a door and turn it around to show the inside.
