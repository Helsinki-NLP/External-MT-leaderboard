Eventually, many small cats (including pet cats) eat far more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special activity that every cat follows, preventing them from competing with others.
The lion is the most social of the cat breeds and lives in large groups called herds.
The faces are made up of one to three related breeds and up to 30 females and young.
Females tend to bond more closely together as a large sister and daughter family.
The lion's pack behaves surprisingly similarly to wolf pack or dog pack, animals that behave similarly to lions (but not to other large cats) and are very deadly to prey on.
As a well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (but not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers (genus Panthera) are a group of lions, leopards, and jaguars, the only four large cat breeds that can shout.
The cry of a tiger is not like the full-powered cry of a lion, but rather like a sentence made up of jokingly squawked words.

Scientists believe that ocelots can be found by tracking the smell of animals (prey) and peeling them on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark, because they have night vision and are stealthy, and the parrot cat hunts prey by sneaking into the environment and hitting its victim.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, when crossing a mountain or river, or when crossing a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from their previous ones.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have different characteristics or adapt to be more competitive than it previously needed.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptations.
As a new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will not be the same species.

Subcultures may be characteristic of members based on age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender.
The subculture may be defined by linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often sign their membership with a recognizable symbolism style that includes fashion, behavior patterns, and the use of argot.

Conversely, animal foods (fries, legumes, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all essential amino acids.

Although the trails consisted only of parallel poles, they allowed horses to pull on them faster and more loads than the relatively few, circular trails of the era.
The connecting elements were used quickly enough to keep the track in place, but they soon realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.

Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, were not yet aligned as usual.
The two-legged species formations are found in the Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.

After its introduction to Congress on July 4, a manuscript drawing signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to the John Dunlap printing press a few blocks down the road.
Dunlap prints today are called 150-200 copies made during the night.
The document was first read by John Nixon in the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and the copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Pages of Dunlap, which is still in print today, is the oldest surviving copy of the document.

The main purpose of science is to use scientific methods to discover how the world works.
Experimentation and an experiment are tests that rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions and observe that also help scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, particularly the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.

The majority of the rhythms of action in physiology and human behaviour depend largely on the occurrence and production of endogenous cycles during the biological cycle.
Most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, have periodic rhythms that are not mere reactions to external periodic signals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that runs freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proofs of the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.

The effects of mutations can vary depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells involved are stem cells.
Only mutations in thyroid cells can be inherited by children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow: movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus traffic processes are generally reasonable and mathematically approximate.
The data presented in the database are based on the data collected by the European Commission.

The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, with a watershed more than eight times that of the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at 6 miles wide.
20% of the rivers that flow into the oceans come from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and drains thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Empire, they never exceeded the size and structure of the Giza pyramids.

Montevideo is located south of Equator, so there is summer when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is found in the subtropics; temperatures above + 30°C are common during the summer months.

There are no particularly wet or dry seasons: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to meeting humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.

Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, you'll find bottled water.
The concept of flat white coffee is unfamiliar to Australians. The short black is called espresso, the cap is stacked with lots of milk (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.

African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide a unique experience for visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to land trips to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, can be seen near cars, so they can be easily observed with average equipment.
The lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and can be seen better with a telescope.
Walk safari (also known as bokorset, wander safar, or fishing) consists of several hours or days of hiking.

Included are Livingston Island and Deception Island, the latter of which forms a spectacular natural harbor with the still-active volcanic caldera flooded.
Ellsworth Land is a landlocked area south of the peninsula bordered by Lake Bellingshausen.
The peninsula's mountains merge with the upper slopes and then rise again, forming the 360-kilometre chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
