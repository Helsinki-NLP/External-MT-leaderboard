Republican strategy to resist Obama 's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by calling for a fight against election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that cases of election fraud in the United States are rarer than deaths from lightning strikes.
And Republican lawyers have counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is for sure: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the American democracy system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That's why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 election, which brought 675 new seats to Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting voting rights in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the voting period, eliminate the right to register the voter on the day of the ballot and strip citizens of the right to vote who have a conviction.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a law passed in Indiana in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they've initiated bills requiring voters to present photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card like a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people, who are of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
The cost of getting a required ID is often more than $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old don't have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates - are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
But those same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly Republican to use the ballot papers issued by those clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
This is the first time such a requirement has been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at restricting voting rights for Latin Americans.
Two-thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote for the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
That restriction has not gone unimpeded.
For example, during the 2004 election, a campaign to register voters helped to register some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws aimed at reducing the voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early voters were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's total.
The same thing happened with Latin Americans.
They represented only 11% of the electorate, but they represented 24% of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who made up 76% of voters, early voters made up only 46%.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to legislation restricting voter registration.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended by the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This allowed for a partial reduction in negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that were passed, seeing them as clearly aimed at influencing the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The Brennan Center's 2011 report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discrediting the American democracy system.
Prostate cancer screening: get tested or not?
In fact, the PSA test can sometimes give false, false, and sometimes false positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men who are so reluctant to go through dispensing have even more to doubt.
Do you want to take the test or not?
We asked two experts.
Studies in the United States have seen a large number of cases of infection among the study groups, so the data is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to formulate any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate for those who had the screening and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that those who had not been screened were 30-40 percent more likely to develop metastases.
So I would recommend taking the test starting at 50, or 40, if one of your immediate family members had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and lazy.
The patient needs to be told the extent of his or her risk of developing cancer, offering options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which is not life-threatening in the long run, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
More and more, we are setting the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I'd recommend taking the test anyway.
But it's also important to consult your doctor to determine whether you should or shouldn't take the test.
In collaboration with the International Urological Association, Movember has created a tool to evaluate all pro and against passing the PSA test.

How to Prevent Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It's believed that if everyone ate healthy and moved around enough, 30% of cancer cases could have been prevented.
"If no one else smoked, that number would have risen to at least 50 percent", says André Bolier, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are hereditary.
Some cancers remain completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Association maintains that smoking control remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 percent of lung cancer cases.
And it's a risk factor for many others.
It is causing enormous damage to human health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", says press secretary André Bolier.
A reassuring fact: Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer", adds the Association.
Food
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
You should also avoid sausage.
The preservation of meat by steaming, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer", the association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But for now, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E have shown conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other one showed the opposite.
The impact assessment of vitamin D on cancer development is also not entirely clear.
However, Mr. Bolyo stresses that it is important to discuss your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Giving the test doesn't lead to cancer".
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, reports that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused a stir - and not without reason.
This boson is thought to explain the mass of all the particles in the universe, not much nor little.
It's also the last particle that was predicted to exist in the Standard Model -- our best, or at least "least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter -- but that hadn't been previously detected experimentally.
But physicists aren't quite sure what the Higgs boson is.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data are not yet complete.
But let's say it's a Higgs boson, because the chances of getting it wrong are minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one absolutely inevitable law that says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way around that rule, don't even try too hard or you'll hurt yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it also turns out to have one law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same quantum state.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
On one corner, we find decent citizens called fermions who wisely obey Paulie's principle.
The other is the bosons, a loathsome gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least this principle, which means they can be at peace in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Particle Adventure Lab's (by the way, quite unusual) site, these bosons are in turn divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", which are the primary forces of nature that are transmitted through and to which the Higgs boson is somehow related.
These bosons themselves, it should be emphasized, are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "courier" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it violates the electromagnetic field at that particular location, like a rock thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore one of the "force carriers" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except that in order for that boson to appear, another field must be "intruded", the Higgs field.
But the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to trigger it, you have to reach very, very high energies, like a frozen pond whose surface can only be shaken by a very large rock.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like the one used in CERN -- the Large Hadron Collider, a ring 27 kilometers in diameter! -- to achieve such huge energies.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact with each other, and some, like no, like a piece of paper, never stays on the fridge.
Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photons, by the way) don't.
So what can all this research bring, Mrs. Plamond asks?
In science, they are used to test the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to sense the discrepancy between the results of observations and the predictions of the SM.
And some of them are eager to see that discrepancy, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and close some of the Model's holes.
The latter, I must say, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (ow!) or for dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe (ow-ow!).
But so far, there's been no such discrepancy at CERN.
The consequences
The benefits of this research for the average person's daily life are harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
Look, in the early '60s, pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs couldn't even imagine what revolution their work would bring.
They predicted their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) himself in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered more like a "laboratory gadget".
I mean, imagine...
And you can also find the app for the research toolkit.
For example, the same William Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, is now the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, doesn't mean that the Big Hadron Collider's work will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that anything can happen.
Palliative care is the best way to die...
The Quebec Commission on Death with Dignity recently discussed a delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon, and a bill is being drafted.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this vital area.
Long tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, put him off for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven", he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadboa's palliative care home in Bella, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, and you can't prepare for it", he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with an appetizing meal, he surrenders and agrees to be helped with food.
He's lively, even smiling, talking to strangers who work around him, bringing him medicine, taking him to the bathroom.
Courage before a normal death.
"My greatest desire for diarrhea treatment is humiliating", he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"We've been taught throughout our lives that men should urinate standing", says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadboa.
Regressing to the state of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"It's all about the ability of the individual" to cope with decline, he says.
Because many palliative care professionals believe that important events are happening at the heart of this decline.
The patients who are admitted to Victor Gadboa's palliative care are all cancer patients.
The prognosis is three months long.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provide what is called "medical" assistance.
Mrs. A., 89, is most afraid of dying "consciously from suffocation".
But the disease allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life", she says before allowing her to wear a mask that will help her breathe.
She's still waiting for her son's last visit in the coming days, who's coming from Italy.
The Victor-Gadboa shelter is staffed by a group of volunteers who provide care and nutrition.
That's palliative care that's left when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one place for every 11,700 residents is in palliative care.
That's a small amount, considering we're all going to die sooner or later.
Life here continues under the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or mental comfort.
We'll give the dying man a brandy or pepsi mouthwash, whatever he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son drank this beer in the dead man's feet this morning.
"We help our loved ones as well as our patients", says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
Victor Gadboa's shelter is no different than the previous day.
Next to a 93-year-old man enjoying his last encounter with his family in the yard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and trying everything to survive.
"Over the past six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under 45", says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor Gadboa Home come from home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is care provided to ease the suffering of patients entering the final stages of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And some institutions, like the Victor Gadboa Home and the Greater Montreal Home Palladium, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is this gap in Quebec's health care system that has made many palliative care doctors fearful of legislation legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by palliative care luminaries Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapoupant, indicating their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not efficient enough to guarantee the right to high-quality palliative care before the euthanasia is allowed.
She says, "I recently saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary steps to relieve it.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients to the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Helen Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she stopped her exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she said she regretted that I was stopping", she recalls.
And she told me that my days were numbered!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not doing their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, palliative care is not an absolute tool in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Care Society, patients are not responsive to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient sleeps until the moment of death, either occasionally or continuously.
We can no longer pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who cannot alleviate pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
People who are in pain always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized", it means "I want to be better off".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Day after day, officials in charge of road construction, construction contractors, political party fundraisers, and specialists in the Italian mafia tell what they know about the colossal "system" that is sweeping the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and the mob.
"The industry", which cost Quebec taxpayers a lot of money, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how this system is falling apart after all the money has been put into it", jokes Jacques Duchesne, a Montreal lawmaker and former police chief.
It was because of him that in 2011 a scandal broke out as a side effect of an investigation into official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then prime minister of the liberals, Jean Chare, agreed to very reluctantly.
The Duchenne Report established a direct link between industry, covert political party financing and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010, he points out, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts" if some had restrained their instincts to take a stake.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dismissed two mayors", he adds, hoping to "open up the schemes behind individual individuals".
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Corruption Unit, which was established in 2011, has been joined by a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the Molot Special Unit, who after 2009 forced the Montréal Stock Cartel to stop the contract price hike.
During the past few weeks, a series of searches have been carried out, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Rishar Marcotta, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next up is Gil Weyancourt, who recently retired as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He's suspected of multiple bribery charges in the making of government orders.
In addition, several Montreal roads service engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter blew up a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of getting government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts made in Montreal to a mafia-linked broker who in turn transferred money to Mayor Gerald Trump's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito was drawing money to the right and left, transferring over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various provincial parties, mostly the liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to illegally collecting funds for former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party, Natalie Normand.
Sewerage contracts in which the value is higher
In Montreal, the corruption system was running smoothly.
Former civil engineer Jill Surprenan described it in detail before the commission: In ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and a total of $736,000 in bribes in exchange for sewerage contracts, which he overpaid.
Other officials responsible for the construction of the roads admitted to being paid off by overpaying the bills by 30-40% with fake additions.
Then one of the organizers from the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Trumpble of intentionally turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's treasuries with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trumpley resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-de-Prèri in the east of the island, she has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will "pull a thread to understand how the ant-infested system works to stop gangrene and identify the culprits".
She characterizes this process as "painful but positive".
We're in the process of cleaning up the wounds, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid a return of questionable practices.
How we're getting home.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchenne notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme" but were not involved in the fraud.
Given that the dirty money in Quebec's campaign finance is 70 percent, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but he says that will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit election spending, politics will be dirty money".
He demands a complete reorganization of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We cannot go down; by boldly getting to the bottom of things, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality".
If this story is a shadow of Quebec and Montreal's international image, Mr. Duchesne urges those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"PSJ is not FC Barcelona!"
You've had an extraordinary run this season at PSJ.
How would you explain this increase?
It can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PTSD.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I'm not getting burned.
From the very beginning at the NIF Pre-Train Center in Clarfonten to my arrival in St. Ethen, I always made progress.
So you're taking advantage of the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
It's not uncommon to play high-level matches this summer.
They also know that every workout is important.
It makes a player like me want to be level and do his best.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti is supporting my positioning.
He's got deputies like Claude MacCale, who played the same position I did.
Ancelotti is the master of the position?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti is a respected technical officer.
He's the best in the Premier League and he's one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he's won a lot of titles with top clubs.
He's worked with the big players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
I had a very encouraging conversation with him in January.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
The trust he places in me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the season?
In the Premier League, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we've qualified for the final eight.
What is the club's aim in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take a match-off in one of the eight finals.
Can PSG become a top European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and secure its position in the long term.
It's not like that today.
The PSJ has the financial means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the Premier League title like last season would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win this title.
We were close to that last season.
In May, it was a disappointment because we had everything to finish first.
It's been a very successful season.
We finished with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
I think this year, everything will be fine.
Even though we have strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expects too much from the PSJ?
It's normal that we're expected to do a lot, given how much we've invested and what players we have.
We're fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we're 4-0 at home against Troy and we're still being criticized, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect of us first.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game design.
The team is formed over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can respond to the challenges of today.
Look at Manchester United, who have been unable to reach the final eight for two seasons, even though they have spent a lot of money too!
Given the amount invested, we've put you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who weren't at the top last season, were excited by this new PSJ.
It shows how exciting the Premier League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The PSJ seems to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
What if they say there's a gold standard?
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's here to do it, and he's proving he's a Premier League star.
Everywhere he played, he showed he was a great player and a world-class star.
We respect him as a person and as a player.
He respects the people around him, too.
What he did was truly extraordinary.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, is also motivating everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
It's disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from harvesting some playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
I 'm doing good qualifying today .
This is what I've been hoping for since I was baptized at the Blue.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to lead by example.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first few months at the helm of the Blue?
They're effective for him.
He's in good shape in the World Cup squad.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and he's an inspiration to win.
The way Laurent Blanc was.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A good-earned draw (1-1), drawn on October 16 in Spain, is the basic match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current central bank-based money exchange, numbered transactions between recipients and fees for processing them.
And as is often the case with these technologies, there is a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, which consists of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-like exchange protocol that allows file sharing between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoin as a donation or payment.
The Bitcoin price, peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later before returning to about $10 today (currencies are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency published in October took an interest in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro", and "like ordinary currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used to promote video games, which are earned in the process of playing or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange is always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are simultaneously bookkeepers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually happens between two email addresses, just like email.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information set relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file allow us to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through solving a mathematical problem sent to the computers that solved it, like a central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
It's a phase of file hashing, which is converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number to it before they hash it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify it's correct.
The transaction thus proves to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If a user wanted to pay twice the same amount of money in less than ten minutes to cheat, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly halved, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred million, leaving a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has already seen its ups and downs.
Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect used is not related to the protocol itself", assures Pierre Nouza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are out of circulation.
The giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices John Holmquist, of Coinabul, a bitcoin-to-gold conversion firm.
Pierre Nouza, another author of the manual on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which makes it cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who don't need to install new devices or software.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, Pierre Nouza says, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to re-evaluate hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is established, it will be a while, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to review the various risks that are considered high today if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobie).
NATO and the Americans should follow them by the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to regain control of their territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying on us alone.
We were mainly Afghan peasants who we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajikists.
They're tolerated, sometimes supported by local rebels, but they won't be around as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base of the Niger, which I watched from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was going well.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles escorted by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014 , there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul .
The circumstances have changed since their unstoppable advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fighting between various groups.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the grim fury of these peasants, which was outweighed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in the modern day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They became dealers who seized state lands to resell them for development to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American subcontracting contracts.
They're discredited; most of them, by the way, didn't even fight themselves.
People, I hear in the countryside, want a government that doesn't consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have been able to do so through American generosity do: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are full of both boys and girls.
We need to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the obscenity of old parties or the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world and are watched everywhere.
There's an army right now.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who led the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial troops who would not be subject to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent, like the Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even before, has been dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been set up, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Prioritise the private sector.
In a country ravaged by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
It only made it feel like Western countries were there to take over.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, without transportation to export it through the mountains, there's no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynac copper deposit, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, one day restore their relations to normal.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win hearts and minds" and to fulfill the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the service "military-civil activity" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These efforts, with the intensive involvement of local labor, helped to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection, and increased cropland.
What will we leave behind when we spend two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapis.
To get rid of the rebellions led by foreign groups, which farmers want, as they told me, we need to give them a little non-military support that is well controlled and goes directly to them.
The difficult births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohamed Morsi's new risky move.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, over the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily grants it extraordinary powers, he decided to play the wa-bank.
Surprisingly, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the work.
Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only increased the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President is persisting in his "autocratic deception", continuing to "violate this word" and "violate the law".
His followers in the camp believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain the Egyptians text, article by article.
It's also a way for the president to restore public and democratic legitimacy while the country is in turmoil.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote is an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I reserve my extraordinary powers", which are supposed to end after the Constitution is adopted.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday in favor of the text.
Most liberals didn't respond to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to express their opinion.
Human rights defenders, religious minorities, and civil society have done the same.
To reach the required quorum, 11 reserve members were rushed in yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is no wonder that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day was about... the time for prayer, as some committee members felt that the hours of the Constituent Meeting were misplaced.
The text on which the vote was held yesterday is 234 articles.
The object of public attention, Article 2, eventually became the same article from the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of Sharia are the basic source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would allow for their stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the liberals answer, who see it as a publicity stunt.
Because they think the Islamization of the Constitution is happening through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular in relation to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is alarming, since "the people who are called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can see the birth of theocracy".
Many liberals are also excited that the next rector of this university will appear to be much less moderate than he is now.
"There is no specific religious intervention at this time.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not scholars, but people with university degrees, some of them in the French system", reassures Alexis Bloë, who is preparing a dissertation on Egypt's constitutional transition.
But he admits that "articles 220 may be ambiguous because the terms used in it are borrowed from religious lexicon.
This applies in particular to the "fiq" [Islamic jurisprudence, - ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to rule on this issue".
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is under criticism because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have declined significantly compared to those under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the defense budget will be considered not in Parliament but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will it be prohibited to try civilians in military courts, despite requests from human rights organizations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy is retained, and insulting is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles are about protecting women anymore, emphasizes Heba Moraef of Human Rights Watch.
She said the only positive thing is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The president's supporters will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pump of Earth and the sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the originality of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
You should go to the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this "domestic" are shown God's favor.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm, and filling his nets.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But the most sacred place in Jerusalem.
The way of the Scourge or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa) is a religious pilgrimage.
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - the Preatorium - where the court was, and leads along the streets of the Old City to the Temple of the Lord's Tomb on the mountain Golgotha - the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pump of Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is built on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also contains the Jewish holiest site - the Wall of Mourning, the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
How to Make a Vertical Journey
The ruins of Massad Castle are the remains of a secret shelter from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are passionate about climbing can walk to them.
The rest of the people are transported to this historic summit by a cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort of Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
He's got a shuttle bus coming down from the mountain.
The total length of the ski trails is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visiting the unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go all the way on one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the earliest known Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the Judean Desert caves, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
You should also visit the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
His exhibitions feature paintings by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renouar, Cézanne, Sisley, Matissa, Modigliani, Chagal, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Bash bath museum, which is a collection of ancient Turkish bathrooms with mullajas of visitors and bankers of the time.
In Caesarea, you can visit the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly prohibited.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - the Children's Memorial - is built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they say the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is mentioned there too.
Get well
Israel's three main resort areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each has a pool, water park, dolphinarium, and oceanarium.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is also a winter swimming area, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms to 23 degrees Celsius.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet, 417 meters below sea level.
The blue water is a salty water that keeps even those who can't swim swim well.
The landscapes around here are incredibly beautiful.
They come here to get a course of treatment with salt water, rapeseed, and healing dirt, and to treat skin conditions, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to get the nerve that's shaken back to normal.
To touch the secrets of the ancient world
They are kept in the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea.
It was the famous Sea Route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Persia saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, Fortune will be favored.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
A tourist to note
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the country's population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money for the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
City transportation is mostly buses, but there is a high-speed tram in Jerusalem, and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country consisting of six stations that connects the Lower City with the Upper.
It's actually an underground funicular.
All city transportation costs 6 shekels, which can be used for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition holds a Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transportation are shut down.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels offer kosher food only, excluding pork, seafood, fish without husks, and foods that include milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, coconut milk soups and desserts, traditional Jewish pastas, humus, a variety of sauces, mushroom nut balls - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many fed cats that "walk on their own".
In the evening, they can even be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The turtles love crowded places and don't give up on meals.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The most travelling and leisure travelers came from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, up 51% from the same figure in 2010, until the visa was revoked on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will get to Moscow: migrants are raising money for language
While lawmakers and human rights activists are arguing about what would make compulsory language testing legal, there are already scammers in the country who sell "lipped" certificates.
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind in their homeland.
On 1 December, a law came into force that requires every migrant to take a Russian language exam.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing, housing and retail sectors.
However, in time, the FMS promises, testing will become mandatory for all visitors.
And we'll have to give up not only the language, but also the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
The language must be confirmed both for obtaining and for extending the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law also excludes people who have obtained certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, destiny and protection of rights
The network of exam points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the SPbDU and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the test in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both the State Duma and the FMS.
But before the law came into force, human rights activists had many times asked the press: What would this actually mean?
What will change the requirement of knowledge of the language for Russians and for the newcomers themselves?
First of all, the Migration Office says, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the Russian FMS representative in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problem is with migrants without a job, education, language skills, medical qualifications.
Without understanding the language, - says Sebellev, - the future migrant is doomed to face unfaithful people who will help him "travel" to a terrifyingly narrow barracks, where he and dozens of others will spend months without food and documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing in their homeland, and when they arrive they are cheated, taken away their passports, not paid their promised salary", - confirms the head of the Head Office of labour migration of the MS Tajikistan Tholib Sharipov.
Don't you dare, the settler!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who are going to Russia to work admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they are seeking, but also have difficulty writing in their own.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as the disaster: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajik can afford even an adequate primary education.
Their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone dress, dress, and equip them properly for school.
When they get to be teenagers, they start working at first.
It's hard if it's bad with language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and unworthy".
However, there is one important point that human rights defenders note regarding the language law.
The testing will only be for those migrants who have legal status.
If there's no status, there's no exam or any formal work.
Meanwhile, most of the gas workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Foreigners are banned".
Many of the visitors say that it is not easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is the bureaucratic constraints and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But you can get a fake registration fast and for only $1,500.
The Russian police know that we have mostly fake documents, no registration, hence extortion cases.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", Tajikistan citizen Umed Khushkadamov shared with journalists.
"Fly, don't get greedy, buy painting"
On the very first day of the language law's entry into force, it was discovered that not only immigrant registration documents were fake.
Several "lipped" certificates of passing language tests have already been seized by the FMS.
The fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they were not a problem for the new owners: each of the migrants, hoping to make it easier for them to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That's more than twice the cost of a formal test procedure: it'll cost a migrant worker 3,000.
The fact that the main task for the foreseeable future is to protect the system from corruption so that the "shorts" can't be bought simply, is that both the authorities and human rights defenders are coming together.
While the authorities can promise the first time the hardworking people who failed the test, time to learn the basic language course.
In addition, foreigners who do not speak Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs is not taking the illegal arms market into circulation
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons is very low
The Russian Interior Ministry is proposing to tighten the law on civilian gun owners.
This is the authorities' reaction to recent incidents: the shooting at weddings when there were no casualties, and the massacre orchestrated by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of injuries in public places and raise the age at which a gun can be licensed from 18 to 21.
The head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaia, supported the idea and promised that amendments to the gun law would be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "twisting the geeks".
The network has published an open letter, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon "senseless tightening".
The percentage of gun violence registered is minimal, said lawyer-criminologist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 crimes involving firearms were committed in the six months of 2012, while 1168 thousand crimes were registered in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of the law on civilian weapons will not prevent the criminal from entering the black market.
Now, they say, you can find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims to be monitoring the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market is filled with weapons through several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the gun ordering site
The first is "army or military trail", i.e. weapons stolen during combat operations in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.
The next kind of "black weapon" is the one that the criminals stole from law enforcement.
Baranez explains that they include both items taken from police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "boats" are being sold from military warehouses.
Many military depots have been subjected to explosions.
"There are proven versions that some of the burns were made specifically to cover the shortfall", says the former military officer.
According to Baranc, the weapons manufacturers contribute.
"Now there are private arms factories that are not able to withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the floors to the black market, including Moscow", the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's a production, sometimes a bush, and a mob formed that organized the flow", explains the former military.
Where'd you get the guns?
Experts estimated the approximate share of each source of illegal arms supplies to the black market.
The Center for Problem Analysis and State-Management Design prepared a report on this in 2011.
The experts analyzed the report of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, the criminal literature and open data of the portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers write, come from the military and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there "by officials whose work is related to weapons", the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflict, 14% are stolen during the production phase, 5% are from "black archaeology".
A salesman at one of the gun stores, who asked not to be named, claims that the weapons found by black miners have long since been bought - too old.
Most often, he says, the salesmen go to the military warehouse for the new batch.
A person buys a unit through a flagship, such as a T.T. gun.
He gets it written out, passed through the receiver.
"He's taking it to town and selling it here for 900 euros a piece with two stores", he says.
"The police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a crime detection plan is burning, they conduct a control purchase from illegal arms dealers", adds the consultant.
"Like a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at the websites and blogs until a friend answered me and offered to come to the Running Platform where there would be a person to take me to the corner where we would trade.
I only learned the price of the barrel there.
Military observationist Victor Baranez
"I have a friend who has a way out", says the salesman. "I have one, but I'm not sure about that.
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to report that his daughter's teeth fell out".
I'm even getting a couple of casts right now through someone I'm sure of.
He's also only supplying them to me because he knows I won't turn him in.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military veteran Victor Baranez tried his hand at buying illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article about it.
The patterns, he said, haven't changed.
They gave him a photo album with "anything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - anything is possible.
I, a potential customer, don't just buy. We go out into the woods with the seller, we set a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm sure the gun is good, we start trading", the expert describes the procedure.
The shop on the couch
Internet search engines lead people to websites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No papers or personal meetings are required.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money", says the advert on the "Buy a Gun or Machine Gun" website.
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
And the minors will be sold?
"Without a license of course", asks the user "Ivan" (orphography preserved).
"I buy T.T. Moscow" - the request of Fedorenkov is succinct.
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of fake sites and those who want to buy a rifle with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia.
military observer and former military man Victor Baranez
I've heard of schemes like this: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
"They send a photo and an instruction in response to the request", says Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the arms rights organization.
Viktor Baranec claims that by leaving the application on the website, you can be left without a weapon and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of fake sites and those who want to buy a rifle with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish to feed, and then they mine coal in Siberia", he claims.
The macaroons for 100 bucks .
Experts estimate that buying an illegal firearm can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Arms organization, Makarov's pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official statistics of the department, compared to January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22,9 thousand, and the number of detected cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers are attacking the United States
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has swept across America at Walmart department stores and popular fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one has predicted whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave or if it's destined to blow out early.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries of Walmart's regular workers and the fast food system, the protest organizers' goal is to create trade union organizations in the city.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The campaign began last week, after Thanksgiving, on what is known as Black Friday, when a cheap-selling orgy swept across America, capturing millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by a riot.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, a company that employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and, along with trade unions and left-wing activists, took to the shops of the company, whose products are aimed at people of modest and middle income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to pollen, eggs and milk.
The products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the big supermarkets.
So many low-paid Walmart employees are only hired at their jobs.
The availability and variety of products made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell goods at a lower price, in part because it pays its employees little.
Some also complain about difficult working conditions, such as a lack of auto loaders or hand scanners.
Black Friday shareholders demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
They said that a typical Walmart employee who gets $9.5 an hour is not in his pocket.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than she's spending on her current salary.
If Walmart were to shift the entire pay rise to the shoulders of its customers, it would cost them only 46 cents more each visit to the store.
In a year, they'll spend about $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters say the protests have taken place in only nine states and have not caused the corporation the slightest damage.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second during that time.
In total, her cash registers produced nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Corporate spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees left their jobs, and that the protest was merely "an alternate pillage" by its union.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where they were not targeted by Walmart department stores (they are not being complained about in this progressive city, so they are not here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even give you hospital bills or pay you for honest work!
Jumeyn Williams, member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the federal and New York minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but not much, and their average New York City employee earns $8.90 an hour.
No one makes less in this expensive city.
How to live in New York for that kind of money is beyond me.
At one time, almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked at their school counterparts while living with their parents went through McDonald's.
Few people saw this as their main source of food or planned to stay there for long.
Now I'm constantly interviewed by McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed their kids.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal has a commentary on the Wall Street Journal that says it's irresponsible to raise children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing or punishing union activists with blackmail and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But it's hard to get fast food to the union for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary flow of the footage.
The Unagreed
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the rally was a midday rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, including city councilman Jumeyn Williams, spoke, saying: "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn't even give you hospital bills and pay you for honest work!"
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio, supported the protesters, who declared that "we must join hands with fast food workers to ensure they get the fair pay and economic well-being every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest such action in the history of the fast food industry in America.
But only a few hundred people took part, and not all of them were fast food workers, employing tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It's not clear if this spark will ignite the flames of mass movement.
"As long as the brain gets the average"
The theme of augmented reality, popular among modern technology enthusiasts, has recently been taken up primarily through the lens of special glasses.
Google first showed the model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, a conversation with Microsoft's Cambridge Lab's head of interactive 3D technology, Sharam Izadi, suggests that the company's scientists are at a crossroads in glasses.
They are manipulated by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell me in general what your research team does?
We're dealing with human-machine interaction, but we're trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
While the human race is stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes it's just finger-pointing.
We want to look back five to 10 years and predict a radical change in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox without Kinect is sold today, because everyone is interested in hand-held control.
- What else is ahead?
- Even though Kinect has moved interaction to the physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input is improved (the system gets more data), and the output is not very good yet.
We're trying to change that, working on true 3-D imaging systems based on a variety of technologies, including projection.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
But to do that, you have to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, the fuckin' virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - the privacy issue is because you don't always want to let people know about your actions and intentions.
All kinds of computer interactions are actually good, but each one is in its own niche.
For example, we had a project to manage devices in public places where we thought about gestures, but not about gestures that were big, but about gestures that were short, short, and cumbersome.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's still big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But the future is a mixed control, like gesture + voice.
- What's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to hand over this gas tank?
You say it and you show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to tell.
So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a close relationship.
I think in the near future, we'll have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
It could be, like, laser sensors, they give a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
Speaking of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Is it a lack of clearance, depth or something?
- Basically, the current generation is something we can push back on in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1,000 kph.
But it's not the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
And from the last standpoint, all of the technology we're using today isn't good enough for us -- it adds to the work of algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X and Y axis resolution, but also the Z axis.
Speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are frankly low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bettis of our Redmond lab has made a touch sensor with a controlled processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, and modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands the impact this has on human-machine interaction.
I could use the equivalent of this device in my work, but it doesn't require touching to make frames larger per second.
- Shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is a reflected signal receiver.
And this third camera is actually a regular range sensor.
It's not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the curvature of the camera's location and see how it helps in 3-D positioning.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not released its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with your smartphone in your hands is not very convenient, but here's what I think the coolest thing would be a transitional augmented reality, where you could switch from glasses to smartphones, projection displays and so on, based on a cloud platform.
Glasses are a very personal device, and that's their strength (you see private things only), and at the same time their weakness - the augmented reality based on glasses won't let you work on virtual objects with other people.
- Let's just say for a minute that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
One problem that critics of this idea often point to is that there is no tactile response!
My hands can't feel anything!
What answers are your team preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth one might be the addition of touch.
And one of the tricks is to use the second hand as a kind of image substrate.
She records the presses perfectly!
But there are technologies that actually aim to give these "aircraft images" a touch -- like interfering with several directional ultrasound rays at a certain point where your finger is, but it's still very weak -- like you're blown into your pillows.
There are wristbands that affect nerve endings in your fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- You were trying to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it yet.
There's another challenge that we're going to have to fight for a long time -- how to get a person physically in a very limited space to believe that they're walking on an open, virtually infinite path -- we're working on the concept of running tracks (not all clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
As long as you're able to trick your brain on average, you'll be working for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher -- a lot of things in an absolutely nascent state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbault continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the city's people who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art.
The top list includes the bright figures of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, passing the all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalto" is epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who's found at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, and fashion parties and vernisages.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds of viewers wherever they are.
Kirill Miller is one of the truly St. Petersburg social-philosophical fairy tale writers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright figure in the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
Besides, he's a city man, a city man who makes people smile and cheer up.
He recently took up the charm and became a St. Petersburg charmist, as he was mature for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around town in all red and not in yellow or purple, like that?
I chose red as a fashion designer, looking and imaging.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker, and society.
Although in society anything that is not a little gray is a source of aggression and a source of bad behavior.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the Nevsky district, where my work was exhibited.
I realized this was my way.
Then the wave of old, unofficial free artists passed, and the new, free types of me were unintelligible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, the post-gas revolution that led to the Pushkin-10 and there was no more wave.
I'm into theater, clothes, music, all kinds of things except words.
It was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took over the territory on Pushkin-10 and there, until it was repaired, there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there, but we, Tequila Jazz, remember when we brought in the Schnur with the "Ear of Van Gogh" project.
The string and his friends sang light songs under the banner, they were in a sweeping trico, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Wdowin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the Hali-Ghalian times.
We gave him Trachtenberg, and he had a great career, and he got his basic education and upbringing from us.
D137 gallery, the Griboyeds Club are the echoes from the Art Clinic.
Our employees and their employees are gone.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, and the award was "People of our City".
I was nominated for Artist of the Year, and I'm at the top of my game.
In a new age, it's uncomfortable to work by old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
It's easy to be popular in our age, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, with a vivid sense of relevance and sharpness.
I'm having a software exhibition, the Russian Museum of Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, but now being social is painful and scary.
But clowns are a mess, tragedy is a mess.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by orderly totalitarian change.
Now, they're meeting by clothing, focusing on the outside mechanics, not the inside person.
Or maybe you can't reach out and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
And recently we saw you as the city's charmer.
Who, if not me, should have.
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be careful, tactical, sweet.
There's a disintegration of cultures.
People used to fight in the herd, the goddess loved one, the fool the other.
Now that everyone's broken up into micro communities, it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And there are thousands of Stas Mikhailov!
- He gets the shots, the sex-social sphere works.
And on a cultural level, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't, and as a result, less management, less money, everything is going to go down.
I have fans, and the important thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the livelihood.
I used to paint pictures when I was young, and one collector had them hanging on a wall next to Falk and Larion.
I started with the pictures that usually end up.
Now they're often confused.
They say culture is spiritual, culture is consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a cultural person of yesterday, raised by artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who gave up money to paint.
I'm for that kind of culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a concept: a cultural official.
But not all of them can do culture.
Under the right kings, it wasn't like that, kings may not have been very knowledgeable in culture, but they knew that you had to hire the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck because we need higher-level experts who can properly assess these experts and give them a lead.
The taste buds are thriving now.
The same Erart, but what distinguishes them is that they honestly say that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow culture is much more, there is soil.
And on our rocks, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural ground, and we have more writers than readers now, which is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of tone.
We need to make art as fashionable as it was in the early 1900s.
The project is implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Born in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with Earthmen on board are on their way to find a backup planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is, how do we continue our race in the untouched environment or on the same planet?
I think the choice is small.
There are actually only two real planets that can be mastered, at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAIH).
But if Mars is more habitable, Venus' surface is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or on Venus' orbit... in space.
The question of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, we did experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their native varieties.
Then we'll take out insects, tiny fruit flies, the Drosophila.
In 1979, a sperm whale was sent into space to test the development of the embryo under gravity.
We get a perfectly normal puppy on the way out.
And then the problem starts.
"The problem is that this puppy must find a support, he must stand on his legs and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Without a support, the birds were crawling in disorderly order.
And ten hours later, the newborns had a complete atrophy of their instincts.
The birds didn't respond to the light or sound.
And the problem was, after four days, they were dead.
"We have been able to kill the birds twice, but we have refused because it is impossible to work with them", says Vladimir Syichev.
The last time a biological minivessel flew into orbit with animals was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only the same-sex individuals will be on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with their fruit.
Basically, they didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again, it is a single experiment, and such studies need to be conducted", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But we can't get to the problem of reproduction directly in space yet.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their familiar habitat, simply cannot exercise their sexual instincts.
But humans, unlike animals, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract mindset, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, these experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our T-shirt flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a space flight.
If she can have a baby after that flight.
"No one answered this question", says the veteran of the rocket and space industry, Vakhtang Vakhnaidze.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
But the risk remains.
We're short on astronauts, and we're growing a healthy generation.
"If more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", concluded the astronaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydro Lab is a mandatory flight preparation stage.
Here, under zero-flight conditions, astronauts are learning to work in open space.
Water imitates weight.
If the water is comfortable for adults but still unfamiliar to them, it is natural for infants.
The tiny ischiandras seem to confirm that life on land emerged from the ocean.
There's a connection between the fact that a baby is in her mother's foster home for about nine months, and it's easier for her to get used to the water.
It's basically logical, because it's only two weeks from the moment you're born, the moment you first bathe.
"It's very little to forget", says a breaststroke instructor named Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for a newborn child, then for a woman, gravity is necessary.
Very quickly, the abdominal muscles, pelvis, and the ability to push the fetus out fall.
All right, let's just drop that, relying on the birth control stimulants.
You can, of course, go into a special cell and give birth, she'll push him out.
"What next?" asks Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, a child needs artificial gravity too.
Without earthly attraction, the body cannot form a skeleton or a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special training suit.
He'll just be deprived of everything he needs for life.
"And this experiment, which we will do with you, by allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring a disabled person, a completely de-adapted person to Earth", predicts the head of the Biotechnology Committee of the IOMP of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Peskov.
So far, having children in space is a matter of theory.
However, in time, it will become a reality when the Earthlings on their ships travel to a distant planet that will be home to their spaceship-born offspring.
Chief Control and Audit: The SWAT system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite having good legislation, is lagging behind in its application.
This is the statement of Miroslav Kal, vice president of the Supreme Control and Review Office, from an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack", he said.
The Czech and German inspection authorities have made similar findings.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Neuschwans approach is brought to the so-called welding system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, the prime minister cannot resist the work of institutions that are charged with verifying and achieving compliance with obligations", says Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, which compared the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What was it exactly?
I mean, a parallel check we started probably two years ago.
In other words, European legislation specifies how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then practical application.
All the information was gathered and, even with the unfinished examination, interesting differences were found - in simple terms, our legislation may be "accurate and flawless", but in practice we are in some respects behind Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how exactly can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can help stop the law being clarified, reduce and improve restrictions because it doesn't work.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it's not a fact that we're gonna get it done by reducing the order limit.
Perhaps the system will be so overloaded with paperwork that those who want to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction were not reduced.
You're talking about the internal problems of the practical application of public procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an organization like our C.R.O. or does it work any other way?
As for the institutions, there is the Bundesrechnungshof, which is our CRA, and there is a committee that works a little differently, but basically both institutions operate in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit divisions there and at the federal land level - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the federal accounting boards level.
What about the local laws, are they easier than we are?
I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany is a model, but it cannot be said with certainty that it is better in everything.
Is it because they're better at controlling?
I'm not sure, but I'll say it again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But even the most exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage from working with our office, would they?
Speaking of domestic law, how have the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution, in some way, the consequences?
Given the short legal force of these amendments, it has not yet been demonstrated in our control work.
Since we're doing a fact check, we need to consider some delay.
We're only taking this into account in the process of preparing future audits -- we've started using our new "risk-of-income detection" tool, which we've run through almost 14,000 government contracts, and we've analyzed them, and of course, these changes are going to show up there because the restrictions are changing, the conditions are changing for some types of tenders, and so on.
Do you think passing this law will bring any benefit or additional burden to the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will become "tougher" and they will be impossible to follow.
When the previous rules are in place, the controlled enterprises are bound to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programs - to the regional council) in that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in such a case?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that doesn't affect the decision.
This system will only put more pressure on the bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's realize that this path is not going anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently said that the GDP would not disturb entrepreneurs by checking the so-called swartz system.
Is the Schwartz system banned or allowed?
The law must be in some way, and if it prohibits something, the prime minister cannot resist the work of the bodies charged with verifying and enforcing obligations.
You can say, "We're going to change this law and we're going to solve this", but you can't say that we're going to pretend that nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act has pretty strict rules about what should be done formally, and that's right.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best bid is disqualified because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are sometimes slippery, but mostly walkable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed in.
They're mostly passable, but some places are more cautious.
The Karlovy Vary
This morning, roads were clear in the Karlovy Vary area, but somewhere frozen and snowed.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but it should warm up a little during the day.
The snow in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, about 30 centimeters of snow is found on the ridges of the Red Mountains.
Data from regional road workers showed that the fog caused lower visibility in some places.
The R6 highway and first-class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be sloppy and slippery.
All roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain tracks, are also accessible.
But some of the sites still contain the remains of frozen and locally covered snow.
You need to be especially careful on high-altitude roads.
Pardubice and Kralovgradese counties
The Czech Highways and Roads Authority reports on its website that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by snow, and that snow may be trapped on mountain roads and highways.
Local road workers warn drivers of the snow, which can form especially on the high ground of the Pardubice region.
The snow can be near the Lanchkrun, Usti-nad-Orlici, Polychka, Svitavi or Vysokého-Mito especially on second and third class roads.
I/43 and I/34 roads near Svitavi are chemically treated.
Especially snow is on the roads of Krkonoše and Orlić.
The snow is found on roads in the highlands of the Rihnov-on-Knezhnow and Trutnov districts.
In the eastern Czech Republic, there are variable clouds today, with no rainfall.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, with a mild wind.
The Plsensk region
The roads in the Plsensk Krai are clear this morning, but some places need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It's cold in the morning, and the temperature is between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, there may be some slippery conditions.
Drivers may experience fog in some places, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by the provincial road workers.
The D5 highway is now practically unrestricted, but road authorities recommend caution between 50 and 70 miles [80 and 131 km].
Most first-class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In the south of Plsny and Tachov, there may be intentional areas.
Second and third class roads are wet, and in this case there is also a warning in connection with the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the less used roads in the Shumava area.
The Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the hills of Olomouc County should take into account the snowfall on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervengoorsk Saddle and on the road to the Videlsk Cross.
The snowfall forced road workers to go out at night, according to information from the road administration, in Schumpperk fell about three centimeters of snow.
In other areas of the road, traffic is generally restricted.
"On the summit of Schumpperk, there are snow remnants.
Drivers heading towards the Yessenica should keep in mind the presence of snow in the Chervengoorsk Saddle", the traffic controller of the traffic controller told the Czech News Agency.
Their colleagues from the Yssenica went to clear the roads at night, making sure that the highways were still bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are free to run, but in Sternberg, drivers must be careful in forested areas where humidity is still maintained.
Usteck County, Lieber County
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are still some difficult spots to cross.
According to the police database, in addition to a few places with snow or snow, the mountain road is closed on the site from Telnica on the Clinic in the Usteck Krai.
The temperature in the lowlands is also negative, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Mountains, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
There's no sign of road complications yet.
Road workers report a blizzard in the vicinity of the Stetti.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for its formation were created at night - rain and snow melted all day, the sky cleared and frosts began.
The conditions on the main highway and I/13 road on the border of Usteck and Libereck are unfavorable.
Because of the curved under the snow of the branches of the trees touching the road itself, the road in Telenitsa on Kninitsa was forced to close.
Shimon Ornes: We want to build positive energy at concerts .
What do you think of the fact that the world should end in less than a month?
This is just one of many disturbing news stories that we humans are so easily exposed to.
With The Tap Tap, we're constantly joking about this and saying that we're the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Besides, you're going to have three totally unique concerts in December against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about this?
This is a national fundraising event that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which ends at 11:10 on December 21.
The day before the event, December 20, at 21:00 three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which has a clock belt 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
It was my idea at first, and then we all came up with it together with our artist Gonzaga Augusto.
In addition to saving enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about what kind of world we will one day pass on to our children.
To celebrate the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, which you can buy on www.e-tap.cz and support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anti-end-of-the-world anthem called "The End of the World Is Cancelled".
Will the already popular YouTube anthem be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it works out and the world doesn't end.
It's sung by all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
The songs will also be played simultaneously on Czech television.
The lyrics to this song were written and played by Tomasz Ganak in the music video, he also participates in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other figures of Czech cultural life, as we host many charity events and concerts.
We're actively engaging them in these projects.
Turns out a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What's the profit on the end of the world concert going to be?
To purchase equipment for the STUDEO Barrier-Free Education Center, we've been working with the Tap civic association at the Edlichka Institute for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students of the Edlichka Institute and hold fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves don't have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them that opportunity.
As part of the project to build the Edlichka Institute, we will have a separate building in the future.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marianne Bango and Irgie Suki.
You can find out all the details on the website www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "great events" in the future?
We'll be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival in May and we'll be making an interesting program with interesting guests.
We'd love to have a show next year at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would love to do a show in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans for the foreign policy, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How are you handling the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems.
We have five people in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, plus a lot of luggage and tool boxes.
However, while we were able to handle this without any problems, Czech Airlines and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
With travel abroad, you can compare countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes toward disabled people, and so on.
What have you been up against so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than ours, in Russia we have seen that the East is still at a baseline level.
Compared to Prague, Moscow has many barriers, and the self-propelled movement of people in an electric wheelchair in the city centre is still wild.
There's also no such thing as a simple thing as giving a disabled person a ride in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already community organizations out there that are trying to bring people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, is it that we must keep up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind the scenes.
But it's important to note that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the people involved.
It's normal in London and Madrid that people with severe disabilities can walk the streets on their own, go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are taking an active part in public life, and we're a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or freedom from barriers is one thing, but the moment we have a great number of athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers, then everything really starts to change.
So far, these are the only cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band right now, but let's go back two years, what made you start it in 1998?
I went to the Edlichka Institute as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself, and I play saxophone, I've organized an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, over time, as our host Lada Angelovich says, it got a little out of control. (Laughter)
Has it only become popular in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true, it helped us to start joining the famous singers and actively promote the band.
We've come to the conclusion that a job that nobody can appreciate is basically like nonexistent.
With the EU's funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was the goal of turning The Tap Tap so well before you?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of things in show business that mimic each other.
It's logical, everything new is taken care of, and it takes a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, it's natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some sort of suffering and abandoned people that we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities get something done, it's a shift not just for them, but for the whole society.
Has success been ensured by being the strict leader that many people consider you to be?
If we want to do our job well, we have to be uncompromising in many things and have a certain discipline.
But I think that's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that they have to go to rehearsal twice a week, attend prep classes, and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently consists of twenty members.
How many were there in early 1998?
There's only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to stop.
For those who have the will and the will, our doors are always open.
It will be held the day before the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012, at 9 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda club and on the Island at the Plynojem Centre with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a cable car at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap's song "The End of the World Is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional, barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlichka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 crowns, and entry is free for children under 12. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency ministers, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began its close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the following years took an active part in a number of agency projects.
But Poland's journey to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to Cosmonautics" at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905), left the audience indifferent, after several years, Sturnfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and Andre Louis Hirsch prize for "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great proponent of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned cosmonaut and his contributions were appreciated, including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
In 1925, a railway train was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea and the details of the project remain unknown.
It's not even clear if the rocket was used to dislodge or to brake the carriage.
The information about this dress is known only from the press of that era.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The research was carried out by the Arms Techniques Section in cooperation with professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustav Mokjicki.
The surviving material shows that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937 the idea of a photoelectric fighter-rocket was introduced in the specialized press, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, and the following year the work "Air-torpedo rocket and air-bomber rocket" by the author of the book, Lelieva-Kjivoblotsky, was published.
Both projects were designed for military missile engines.
Before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technology projects.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the work was terminated due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronavtics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The Society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal "Problemas", which published four volumes of articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of the PWA became its member.
The following year, the first chairman of the IAA, Kazimeg Zarankievich (1902-1959) became the vice chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to perform scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of reaching a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long, and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 two-stage RM-2 rockets were tested in the Bledovsk Desert.
This rocket was about 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kilograms.
The next version of the rocket was already capable of doing real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could travel 14.5 km, and its task was to observe high winds.
But in 1962, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM type of rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32,5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was capable of carrying a useful load of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Then versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland joined COSPAR (Committee on Space Studies) in 1960 and established the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germanshevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the value of labor (wage) there is a price tension.
By this concept, we must understand the state in which a producer, by delivering a cheap commodity, tries to stand out in economic competition by "beating" the value of the competitor in order to take over a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either moving production abroad, or buying cheaply abroad, or disappearing, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where labor costs are higher than in other countries.
Since private capital carries no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable expenditure of the state on social needs increases.
In general, the situation is exacerbating the reluctance of business owners to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social and economic damage they cause in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
The unbridled practices of private capital create a situation at the level of individual states' economies where governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially lower the social levels of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving their own population to private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes to the existing legislation.
The goal is to economically force its people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for reducing workers' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty levels increase, and at the same time, the gap between rich and poor increases.
For several years now, the German government has been distributing food to the poor who cannot feed themselves by their own labour.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases where employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra to get a living wage.
This scandal was also known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag employees.
The economic measures in almost all southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century or live on a poor wage in the backyard of society in the hope that private investment capital will come to the country.
But the question is, where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it won't come at all, because Chinese, Hindus, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans still work for a share of European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are sick of the idea that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that the managed economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by managing its actions.
The question then arises whether private capital, which now manages politics and the whole state, is acting for its own selfish ends.
The answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost all-powerful and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a dead end situation, which is corruption, mutual benefit, legislation, where practically everything deserves punishment, but it's not a crime.
In Germany, the state ministries, due to lack of funds, entrust the drafting of laws to private law firms that are closely connected with industry.
Then the bills are passed by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution says, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal democracy is now rapidly falling into a situation described by Appian in The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long since collapsed, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal receiving of graces with stones and swords.
Taxation and corruption flourished without any prohibition, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote"... ordinary people did not run for governor at all, eventually one day the state was left without a consul for eight months".... "They seriously began to talk about the only salvation in this terrible situation being autocracy and the need to choose an energetic man"..
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own irrational interests without regard to public interests.
Private capital is no longer intended for public use.
The current outcome is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any attempt to bring about deeper reforms.
So the reason for the rise of fascist and communist regimes is that we must look for the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-style democracy can be seen as a certain pause followed by the next round.
The tragic thing is that the current elite is completely ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international, national and European levels, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's share of the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in state governance and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence, and never can come out" - Sting, "Fragile", where the main refrain is the words: "We don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons hadn't wanted wars, they wouldn't have been there", said the dying Guthel Schnapper, wife of Meyer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has sparked a lot of reaction.
Some support Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defense, and Palestinians are acting as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that it is the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of Palestinian Arabs, and that the state of Israel is a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who in these periodically recurring waves of murder is the criminal, and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the moment of the current political situation, and they didn't witness the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a glimpse of the 95-year-old tension (as of the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reasoning is backed up by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their own steps, or whether someone was behind them to direct their actions toward their goals.
It is to be assumed that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have happened in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, one that could be considered the head of the spruit (I don't know if anyone stands above them, but that's not excluded) is the Rothschilds.
They don't write much about them.
Of course you do.
They bought the first news agency in the 1990s to stop the rumors that linked their name to criminal activity in the higher realms they were in, and that always led to their power, wealth, or both.
They have large stock packs in almost all the world's central banks, and against countries whose central banks they do not have their shares in, they are waging or preparing war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took over its country's central bank).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of a central bank under the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began issuing his own (ponymay - government) money and was killed in 1865 in a theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created by the great 33rd-level Mason Albert Pike.
The first war was to destroy the monarchical states of Europe, the second to destroy colonial rule, especially Britain, and the third to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be enough to provide their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume many resources), the creation of a unified universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds operate is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, beginning the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended with Germany's sudden, unfounded surrender in military and economic terms (the war was no longer necessary to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary, occurred.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military reparations on Germany, thus creating the prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then only to throw the Germans a strong enough leader to blame the guilty and offer simple solutions, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to play, and indeed played the role of the fifth column, when the fire of war was ignited.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration set the stage for mass Jewish immigration to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, and it was difficult to say whether Hitler broke free from the chains in which the bankers had originally held him, or whether everything he had done was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a third war.
If the international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will be the victim of fighting on the front lines, now alongside the Arab or, more simply, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only at home but also internationally (just take the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is to blame for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
It's important to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are only suing people to vote in elections for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, the Hawkeye Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, international banker-loyal politician doing everything to start a war with Iran that, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control of the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of all world oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
What is the meaning of David Rockefeller's 1994 words: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will embrace a new world order?"
The new world order in their view is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is served by a handful of financial aristocracies enjoying comfort.
A world where every newborn organism is implanted at birth with a chip that makes it a being under total control.
"It makes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: Anyone who has reason can count the number of the beast.
For it is a man's name, and the number thereof is six hundred and sixty-six.
Operation Argo: When the worst is over, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The US administration was not expected to see a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it could have undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the home.
The defeat in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The movie, directed by Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo", depicts one of the episodes of that story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult ordeal, they ended their journey to the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to retrieve them from Iran, aided by an extravagant cover-up legend that they had travelled on Canadian passports as members of a film crew looking for a place to shoot a science fiction epic.
Mix of genres
The plan, devised by Tony Mendes, an evacuation expert, required Hollywood to cooperate.
To make the legend true, specialized magazines wrote about the film's project, held press conferences, and a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendes's memoirs.
Affeck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-cinematography", a story of a successful plot, an affair - an example of this could be a series of films about Ocean's friends.
The film is constantly changing - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the titles show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there is no big difference).
On the other hand, the light-hearted Hollywood clips intersect with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits discussing the situation behind negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has done a great job of rebounding his career.
The mocked actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be a subject of ridicule.
"Operation "Argo" is his third full-length film, following the dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Afleck film not to be shot in the director's hometown of Boston.
The atmosphere of the place is also a reflection of the qualities that were held by the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Afleck is showing that in Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the embassy's fall are impressive with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when a story suddenly changes somewhere.
Afflek and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in the scenes of fictional (fake headquarters in the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He's pretty successful with this little thing, sometimes he's figuring something out - it doesn't all come out so elegant (a scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the runway chase seems pretty figured out).
The disadvantage of Argo is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really charming, but their characters deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the movie.
Affeck's film lacks a bit of drama, a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro-style that recreates the thrillers of the '70s.
But it's hardly exciting.
Yet, this is enough to remind us of one, still alive in some sense, history, and to show how exaggerated the idea of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services is.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com portal, which annually conducts a survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop".
"We were driven to this by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of major European companies", said Patrick Nager, the survey organizer for the Right.
Among the absurdities already nominated is the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to combine the rates of insurance contributions for men and women.
Women have been granted life insurance benefits until now because they are less likely to be exposed to risk by insurance companies.
"The most incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted to the competition by the end of this year.
The vote itself will be held until the end of February 2013", Nager said.
The EU's controversial regulations include mandatory bio-components added to fuel, which is harmful to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermostats only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a chicken cell size directive that has caused eggs to rise in price this year.
The use of the term "butterfly oil" or the withdrawal of classic lamps from sale was also criticized.
The quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The European public apparatus often makes decisions under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even with a veto threat defends its banks' demands).
The lobby's interests are: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union were to reach a length of 14 cm and not dare to show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission justified itself by only harmonizing existing divergent national rules that complicated trade.
Despite resistance from some countries, the EU has still relaxed standards on fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives will lead to waste.
Last year's EU resolution, which requires air balloons to be sold with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult supervision, could also be a candidate for the poll.
The EU has appealed to US studies that show that balloons in play are a potential cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are prohibited from blowing in fairy dowsing.
Funny ideas are born at home.
The rule of European officials is also quite absurd: anyone holding an official position in the EU cannot, given the delicate nature of the issue for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but must instead say "BURM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the liberal economists' association Laissez Faire, proposed for voting, in addition to a few of the above absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day it joins the European Union.
Later, for example, the Czech Republic exceeded the prescribed quantities of preserved mushrooms, for which it was subject to a large fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting subsidies to applications for subsidies.
But these ideas were born in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation", said the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas (Federal Agricultural Commission).
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield and as a result of so-called intervention purchases the state had full stocks of supplies that needed to be exported.
Because the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palazzo, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission has therefore launched a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
Subsidies for the subsidy were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to go to the subsidy application from Brussels.
EU: Weird orders are an exception
While decisions in member states are easily criticised, the EU's regulatory efforts, as well as efforts to make the EU work more effectively and develop, many experts say, deserve recognition.
A serious problem, experts say, is the EU's funding of projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in budget discussions.
The Czech Republic, like other European Union countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to specifically identify its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs retained the name "Olomouc cheese" after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, the tradition of the "Tuzem rom" in our country dates back to the 19th century, and our producers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
Rum can only be made from cane distillate, not sugar beet.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous "fet" and "gorgonzola" cheeses, marzipan from the German city of Lübeck or Parma branches, already includes, for example, karlovary dryers, pogorjelitski and trshebon carp and jateski ham.
Pardubice parsley and gorgeous tubers are also EU trademarks.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur", says Okamura.
Senator, how does a man come up with running for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything was going smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running for office.
But I can't stand to see the country go bankrupt over the last 20 years, thieves go around, people get taxed and retired.
I had no ambitions of being a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent person, not affiliated with any party, I have no choice but to influence things, but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential palace.
Do you not turn your back on the people who have chosen you?
I've always said I'd join the presidential castle fight depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool I can use to make my views come true.
That's why I need the most influence and the most authority.
But the difficulty is that not only are we as a nation roaring at our bar or at our TV, but we are also ready to roar anyone who tries to change something.
To this are added the media that blackmail you and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lying.
For example, I was told I bribed journalists or I was an adviser to Irgie Paroubeck.
Let's get to your point of view.
You started the presidential castle fight with a thesis about the material and criminal liability of politicians and the return of property declarations worth more than 20 million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only the entire Senate can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for tourism to become free enterprise, it was a step forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or right, they're deliberately getting in the way, and that's holding back the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without any party-wide scheduling, without any dogma, I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing person?
From a Czech perspective, I think people tend to think of me more like a leftist.
It doesn't matter to me a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being right-wing, it's about someone being left-wing. I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether the CCP or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But can you prove it by what you say?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and visions.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You could call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in place in the world, or they're being discussed by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll only have slogans.
And you're not going to be in politics for long.
Or do you think that when you go out and talk to people, you can actually be held criminally and financially liable?
I don't have a choice.
Just convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so we can get what we want.
If I were elected president, it would be easy to organize a live television broadcast in which I would address parliamentary party chairs with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there's a strong person who can voice abuse, then there's a way to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct presidential election, it was a public pressure.
I'm telling you straight, I'm an amateur, not a genius, not an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just starting out in politics, and I'm gonna try to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying to get things going on my own; if I don't, I'll be out of it in six years and back in the private sector.
It's partly like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything alone, so I passed a number of famous people by asking to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused because of the large volume of work.
I also at least supported the lead investigative journalist Jan Lorentz who exposed the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I ran for office because people are really unhappy, but I feel like I'm on the scales now.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and most of those who went elected the establishment.
There's only two of us in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate in such a way that change would be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, like direct mayoral and governoral elections.
You're thinking about starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to check the past of every potential supporter, and I don't have the money to do it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about property claims, and how are your own cases with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of artwork worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth a million, and a few million more in the bank.
By the way, I got Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream -- I always liked James Bond, who drove cars, was a galant with women, and at the same time fought against malice and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, own $60 million in real estate, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors indicates that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign expenses are basically going to be covered by my senator's salary.
But I wouldn't live on that money, like I couldn't pay my son to go to an English school that costs $30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for office.
So you're going to be an entrepreneur to make a living?
Didn't you say you'd cut this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I've partially cut back on my activities.
For example, my deputy will be managing director of a travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a silver-free man who would keep the republic.
But I need to live for something, too.
How much do you, as an entrepreneur, get used to getting every month?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get from there.
And if I was president, I would be done with my business.
You'll find the full interview in the Saturday edition of Law.
MVRDV architects prove that real adventure is not just in the imagination - like Spikenis and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and we finally get to see something interesting again", says Lisette Verhaig, walking along the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a large nearby facility, says, "No, this building is really beautiful".
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, the iPad, and the e-books.
No one volunteers to go to these old-fashioned libraries anymore, right?
Spikeniss, a small sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to public education and build seven imaginary bridges, depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatures of iron concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had only one way to beat the statistics: to build a library here!
Viny Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold columnar diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, responded to the task with his usual calmness and appeared at the audition in 2003 with five books under his nose and a smile on his face.
And as the jury members looked around and shouldered, the bold Maas folded a pyramid in the size of his original gift and finished his speech in defense of his project with the words, "Dear Citizens!"
Here's my offer: the Book Mountain in Spikeniss, called the Bukenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain has grown to a value of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, the "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012" competition.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national wooden buildings competition.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a strikingly ugly town hall whose white facades suggest a dairy factory, became richer for one modern architectural work.
But most importantly, the town of Spekennis has the first public building of cultural significance.
The long road to the book
First impression: Eldorado's book under a cheese cap.
There is only one elevator that runs through the center of the mountain range, and true architectural and literary enthusiasts prefer to explore the area on foot.
The room is bright and easily visible, with brick floors and elegant street lamps that give the city a sense of public space.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The eyes are unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Typically, bookshelves are along the facades, and in the middle is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless", says Winnie-the-Pooh.
We've set the classical configuration of space from head to toe and pulled the reading zone from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain is well used: the center has offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical facilities.
Especially pleasing are the black bookshelves, which serve as wall decorations, parapets, and stairwells.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and civil engineers are lost in their guesses as to what unknown material this is.
"We wanted to work with secondary materials", explains Yop Trauborst, project manager for the community of Spekenniss, in line with the standards.
And one day, at an agricultural establishment in Friesland, we came across a suitable agricultural byproduct.
For many years, artificial fibrous materials of millimeter thickness have been used as a rootstock in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-saving.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, then they can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas -- the first of its kind -- was pressed into a four-centimeter-thick panel.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called landfill plastic (KLP) is transformed into a dark, uniform, durable material, with a slightly new car-like smell and a little slippery feel.
There are 105 steps to the top.
The one who makes the nearly 500-meter-long trek will be rewarded at the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and wooden figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all, the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an example of an ecological project", says Trooborst.
The heat of the earth is used to heat and cool it.
Although Mount Book is under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun only penetrates for a short time.
The extensive wood-glue farms, perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has been here before.
And Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchanan "the long-lost soul of Spikeniss".
The reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate one book from his congregation.
These books were to fill the empty shelves of a library that had not yet been fully completed - at that time, there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are on top.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Vinnie Maas.
"I think that because of our invitation, every resident is now connected to this new home in some way.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration.
So MVRDV was able to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called creating identity.
Spikenissé wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point for building an identity.
Sobo: "Germans have to play a bigger role".
Germany abstained from voting on recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why? Why?
Stefan Saba: Germany does not support the Israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think she's not supporting the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the 2011 uprising in Libya in March, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
NATO eventually made the offer.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from the policy that the US, so to speak, was running, to the German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the lack of a coherent policy among Europeans.
So the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just starting to see their roles, but they're on their way to a more normal foreign policy.
It's a foreign policy like France or Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It's a willingness to take a stand in their national interests that is independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and connections to certain regions, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests differ greatly from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf.
So she needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab world.
Either way, it's got a role to play.
But I wouldn't take it too seriously, it's not a one-way communication.
But in any case, it plays a big part in the Germans' calculations.
Did Germany damage its relationship with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States there is a prevailing understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic a violation as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even gain some respect.
It's a sign that she should be taken seriously as an international player and that her interests should be taken seriously.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has been clear on the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But given the local political situation, the government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that substantial differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is not at all happy with Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a single, uncontroversial European policy, but that is not the case now.
So they can't take a broader approach and instead have to act on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It's not easy for Germany, of course, at least because of its ties to Israel.
This has always been a hot topic.
But I think the Germans know they need to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take the lead?
Or is it still hard for Germany to take the lead?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on a major role, there are a variety of anti-German sentiments.
The Germans are not easy to deal with.
Actually, it's an old problem: You don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
She needs to take into account the different neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
So the US influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, so who's left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, if it makes you feel uncomfortable, or if it makes you feel worse, that's life!

China's trademark protection: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It's a fully registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies that gave it its name.
However, it will remain in custody until the original owners of the names file a lawsuit.
But it's still unclear if they'll be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Patloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a company specializing in trademark infringements in the Far East.
There's a new case of this kind on my desk every week.
Imitators can only add a few letters to get their trademarks registered.
So Gucci is Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies such as sports goods manufacturer Puma are legally copied.
Patlock opens a file with the records of the trademark registration office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name, which also uses the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Patloch's case is not that, and he is opposed to Chinese companies being given the right to use a trademark registration authority that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it the ban minpai, the passenger mark.
This word is associated with "ban daquan".
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
Chinese authorities have denied any wrongdoing
"It's damaging business, and we need to fight it", Patlock said.
"The brand is being eroded, the unique position is being lost, the image is suffering very much".
Financial losses and process costs in affected industries are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copying products.
According to CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods with annual sales of 15 billion euros.
However, it is difficult and expensive to remove any questionable records in the trade mark register.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Patloch recounts cases in which the court dismissed claims, as the name of the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he'll even have to pay the plaintiff for damaging his trademark in China, Patloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, which had acquired the firm Putzmeister shortly before.
So the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem that looks like a Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo, Geely, initially used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to Hong Kong and Singapore imitators, who had the famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO trademark registration office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to a shortage of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was a "return from the workplace emergency to normal".
So the number of unresolved objections decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 cases have been closed, up 75 percent from last year.
Still, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
It 's worth fighting for .
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency reports.
The same goes for the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to protest, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to get their illegal manufacture of counterfeit automobile parts eliminated.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a personal omission, since surnames in Germany are not protected, says Hannon Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark registration office rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues to fight.
We Need to Be Watchful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money, and energy".
Internal costs are hardly quantifiable, and the firm's archives have had to look through even 100-year-old documents to get evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side a "big six-figure euro" settlement.
"It's clear how much it costs us", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over into Europe.
That's when the imitators register unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather goods.
The company has long since stopped production in these areas, but it has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be on your guard", says Wentzler.
Both he and his lawyer Patloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
Rather than relying on international trademark protection regulations, foreigners should "register anything that is in any way worth protecting in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could cost you a lot more than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg loses the final act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party the license fees for his own name, Ventzler explains.
Otherwise, we'll be thrown out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: flooding, singing and helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongs are rehearsing, and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy to do so.
The history of relationships that have covered more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, the cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's slippers pick up the pace on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers' voices - alts, basses, tenors and sopranos - slowly grow, they step on, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his maternal shoes when he leads them with his flexible, expressive gestures.
Monday night, the Imbongs choir rehearses a new song in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty choirs from 23 to 69 years old, from a human genetics specialist to a courtesan, attended the rehearsal.
"Om" Obani is a difficult thing, each choral voice has its own lyrics, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to the UN AIDS Programme, Unaids, there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
Voices for Africa has found managers in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them go to a school that prepares them for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over as a chef.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
In Zulu, imbongs mean a narrator or praiser.
They don't speak fluent in this hall, but they can sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been studying songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally even bringing them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
At 8,733 miles [8,733 km] in the summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which relies on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, with many children among the residents.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents to HIV.
The Esitjeni miniature shows the disease of all of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Extreme circumcision in men, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost uncommon among the population.
More than 40 percent of the population of Swaziland is infected with the virus, and deaths in the middle of the fourth decade are not uncommon.
The choir opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school education, a man in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants to send a child to school for a few euros a year and give him the opportunity to get hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since become a professional organization that cares for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial PIDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral infections are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The foot and mouth disease are parasitic PTI.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than among other populations.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
We also have a lot of human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to register.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people with syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than last year.
What are the symptoms of venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can include genital ulcers, urinary complaints, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or sealing.
However, they often go unnoticed and are not accompanied by pain or other symptoms.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't provide 100% protection.
In fact, some sexually transmitted diseases can be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially if you change sexual partners frequently.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid far-reaching consequences.
The management, donations and, not least, the fees for choirs performing all over Germany allow us to collect something.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitzchen", says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money is handled by a German woman, Códwa Dlamini, who is conscious and active.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well-organized, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as Zulu old women call it, is the backbone of the village.
Some have taken in up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads, and making sure that the children in good shape arrive on time for school each day.
Those who have no relatives are taken to the shelter of Hanisil, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, in partnership with the US health organization PSI, has organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It's hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious all over the country, is preferred to be deeply silent.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is a taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it is related to sexuality".
It's quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent years.
But it's also on the wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh".
To encourage cultural exchange, every two or three years the Ibmogy Choir travels to South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many in the southern edge of the Black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing in black - a confession that not only brings good humor and joy, but also occasionally brings tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads to Esitzgen, where the singers visit the children under the head.
Although a small village is hard to find on a map, it is more than well known in the Etzulveni River Valley.
"Go to Esitzchen, there is light", say the locals.
And after a 8,733-mile flight back to Heidelberg, when the diving singers are returning to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that light is burning here too.
NASA is opening ice on Mercury .
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA's space agency has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as revealed in three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the planet's ever-shadowed region is covered in ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters thick, perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Supposedly, the water comes from a comet or perhaps an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific director of the probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury could reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other life-forming elements got to other parts of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, small windows into endless darkness.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres, as defined by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the Spitzer infrared image is a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue dots, and it's harder to identify pink "newborn" stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation - scientists unromantically call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This flashing star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
A donut-like ring is made of material that the star throws away when it dies.
In the giant Triphid nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic birth chamber.
The Pleiades constellation, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen by the naked eye at night.
Of course, the color telescope works better.
As the red eye blinks to the observer, the fog of the street in this infrared image.
It's 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarity to the Earth's continent has given this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive color transmission.
This new star in all its beauty was only photographed using the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came to be - one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's possible that these are fragments of Saturn's moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: the Hydro-Drying Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
A photo published by the European Southern Observatory shows a few thousand light-years away the Trifide nebula in the constellation Arrow.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (trihedral, trihedral), as the dark stripes of dust divide the scorched heart of the star's crust into three parts.
In the constellation of Jupiter, astronomers photographed a foreshadowing of a space collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are moving toward each other and inevitably collide.
This is the birth of a star captured by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations might call it the "Southern Wheel".
A photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cepheid.
The fog, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal house dust.
This image was made from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star nebula contains the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The cluster is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosetta nebula, also creates new stars at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there's no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was largely hydrogen-rich.
Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgei - well before Galileo Galilei began observing stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown in size - and the spaces they can see have deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror pictured here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, the United States, the Big Binocular Telescope has been installed.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Big South African Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to reduce costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about ten feet.
The lack of a cheap design: the telescope is rigidly fixed under a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature is its high light-gathering capability.
Despite its relatively small diameter, it reaches the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
This is the very large telescope, which is exactly what it's called.
Its four mirrors allow the medium infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the optical tube.
The ESO Chilean Observatory is also planning to install a European "Very Large Telescope".
Its main mirror should be 42 meters wide - and it will be made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both the "Kek" telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The "Kek" telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks up at the sky with the help of the "Subaru" and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope will be built on Mauna Kea with a mirror 30 meters in diameter.
You can see them in the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been painting distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photographs show the latest developments of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for the first stars and galaxies to explore the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger is rotating closer to the planet's north pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the first Mercury-spinning Messenger in 2004, scientists are now convinced.
Drink oil every day and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents are of Bible age.

Searching for a solution in a country where 97 year olds seem relatively young.
The trip through the Talash mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
The microbus, with a thunderstorm, is rolling along a winding road past dense forested hills, stormy slums, and simple peasant houses.
It's so green and bright that you can think of yourself as being in the Swartzwald.
But this is the southernmost tip of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
The Talysh people live here - one of the Caucasus peoples, about whom little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and have a long life span.
The end point is Lerick.
The small town boasts a very heavy-duty Soviet architecture that doesn't quite fit the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe barely come here, the road from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, has not yet reached here, in the province.
However, Pilat Fatuleva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerica.
"In May, Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have the festival of the world's oldest people", says Fatuleeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
The biography of about eight dozen bald eagles from these places, over 100 years old, is documented here.
That's my grandfather, he's been here 120 years.
At the age of 136 he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the caban of Shirali Muslimov, who is said to have turned 168.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person whose age is confirmed by documents was 122 years old, the age of Muslimov seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973", Fatuleeva explains.
The man was married three times, and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
Has the Muslim herd added a few decades to its age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of longevity in Central Asia.
"There are also a remarkable number of elderly people in parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley of Pakistan", says Scholz, "and there are also a tremendous number of very old people in Sardinia".
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, as there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of heated oil
Nevertheless, the fact is that people in the Leerick area are surprisingly often of Bible age.
There are now 20 people over the age of 100.
Why are there so many long-lived people here in the South?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Muhimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talis.
The director of the museum, Fatuleyev, on the contrary, believes that the food is involved.
The Thais love meat, bread, and most of all dairy products, many of whom drink a glass of warm oil every day, but such a high-calorie diet is unlikely to be nutritionally healthy.
Or is it a primitive lifestyle that keeps people young?
At 97, she's still relatively young for these breeds.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of oil, and she's been rolling around all day.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughters, who have grandchildren for a long time.
Two babies are also coming up.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea in typical, boiled cups of mustard.
Mirzaeva has perfectly straight and strong white teeth, and under her headband she hides long dark-red hair, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so it never falls out and stays in color.
"I never used shampoo", Mirzaeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in my life.
Then she tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after World War II.
But it got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev got behind the wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult that is created around the figure of the nation's father, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the elderly in Azerbaijan.
Mirzaev receives 230 manats (about the same amount as the euro) as a monthly pension, which is a good amount for living in the local conditions.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long-lived son is also right: "In our culture, the elderly are deeply respected".
They live in a big family, loved, cared for, and happy.
What's not to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is not in the constitution
The revolution is back in Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are a sign of a deep divide in the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia met fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't buy the paphos.
We need to make a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but primarily to Coptic Christians, liberals, educated Muslims, and nonreligious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily reduced the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and expanded its jurisdiction "to save the revolution".
But what a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the University of Southern California really wants to do is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged in a 15-hour nightly hurdle at an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the judicial process is based on "principles of Islamic law".
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and legal luff to make the Sharia more rigorous.
At least one recent article suggests that in all matters relating to Sharia law, Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved in the council.
It shouldn't, but it could mean that the clergy are overseeing legislation, which would de facto have the effect of limiting the judiciary.
In the draft constitution , a lot is a subject of interpretation .
Another problem: the civil justice system must be maintained.
These courts were used to suppress the opposition during Mubarak's rule.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prison.
The draft also states that the state must "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morals and values".
It is so vague in legal terms that government agencies can use it to control even the content of movies and literature.
In open text, it means nothing but censorship.
There is no article that directly establishes equality between men and women.
The other prohibits insulting and insulting the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that "offending people" is forbidden is also questionable.
Will cartoons of the president or jokes about a lawyer be enough?
The question of interpretation, like much of the draft, is what Morsi is proposing for signature and which he says will "very soon" be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks now, there has been a growing opposition to Islamist supremacy.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unity on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could take effect.
"The revolution is back and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the constitution was "in the dustbin of history".
Through a short-lived news service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down", said opposition leader Yasser Saeed.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged", Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to watch the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Quran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile outside Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women undercover and Salafists who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded from Morsi, "Cleanse the country!" and assured him, "The Quran is our constitution".
The struggle for power over the symbolic square where it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Murcy's followers clearly didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clearly.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
Most of the Islamists are for the project, it's considered a done deal.
"The concept of human rights is never mentioned"
Hafiz Abu Sa'ida is furious at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
A 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, arrested for it.
And now the word "human rights" is never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of influence over all three branches of government is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto cancelled it", Sayeda regrets.
Because without civic social organizations, democracy cannot function.
Said feels abandoned by everyone, even the international community, who are looking at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be a payback.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster you cannot control".
Norwegian crabfish: the world's most stinking fish?
Norway has a population of five million, one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but in the world.
Perhaps the secret to this country's success is a local obsession with one extremely odorful fish dish?
Take some overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty, sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll get a stunning scent of crabfish, one of Norway's most famous delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours' drive from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but the air has an unquenchable characteristic smell.
A rackfish is a trout that is salted and floats in water for up to a year, depending on the type of fish to be caught.
As the dusk gathers and it gets cold, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, say, exciting dish.
"It is eaten raw and drunk with a sip of aquavit, a local dark vodka", explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and co-director of the festival.
People all around us eat fish cut into small cubes and drink it with plenty of alcohol.
"Some people like watermelon better than fish", says Howard.
This drink is capable of breaking the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can get a piece under your nose, it's not that bad - it's not much different from the sushi you've been carrying around on a bus for a long time.
Rackfish is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, before refrigerators even appeared, fish were soaked in a sealed jar of salt water in the autumn.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had matured well, they extracted it and, by drowning the sensation with alcohol, used it as food.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States, is still in the memory of the past generation.
Now the population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 percent of immigrants attracted by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
The residents of Sweden (a longtime rival, and not so long ago a much more affluent neighbor) come here to work.
The rackfish is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, if somewhat monstrous element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you nine pounds.
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most people seem to like it.
People here still reluctantly mention the name of Anders Brewick, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Not to mention his name, the attack is called "the July 22 incident".
It is hard for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway's current prosperity is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we thrive", says Anna, our waitress, who distributes a can of hard-boiled can of worms, a woman with long light hair and strikingly blue eyes, an embodiment of Norse prosperity.
We are a people, as you call it, who are rational.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English fluently.
We don't like to be shown, we're not proud.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the oil and gas industry's revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was running out of money they didn't have, Norway was careful to calculate all the expenses.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that's enough to be happy", says Anna.
"And there's a crabfish", she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in line in the snow for some food. I'm done with the crab.
This salmon burger is definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But tonight we're expecting even more of the same fish with the same unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special dinner dedicated to the fish of the crab, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps most aromatic fish.
There's a live broadcast showing the host in a butterfly tie surrounded by a plate of crabfish.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what's your rating for the best fish out there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our estimate".
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls off a chair, maybe from a watermelon.
Or maybe just by breathing in the smell of that fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is about to embark on a difficult career.
As Mexico's newly elected president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he faces and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly dire state.
The city is overloaded with transportation and at the best of times, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting through several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will wear the presidential veil and take over the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has been doing well in the current administration of Felipe Calderón, but the country is engulfed in a six-year war on drugs that has claimed some 60,000 lives.
"My government is declaring to the people of Mexico that it is ready to fight violence", Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House's Oval Office.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.
Before these statements, Mr. Peña Nieto's political career alongside the president of the United States was developing as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, a densely populated and sprawling state surrounding the nation's capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A straight man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
The residents credit him with reviving tourism, developing the resort and building infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pena Nieto, which are markedly different from the roadways with the slopes and pits that were previously on this site.
His name is displayed on the modern sports center building and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are hopeful for real and serious change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Hernandez, a state congressman for the Penya Neto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect the real and decisive changes that our country so urgently needs, first and foremost in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous rule, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos Presidential Palace, the party has placed great hopes in Enrique Pena Nieto.
He also denies the opposition's allegations of contempt of court.
He's very straightforward and very committed to the vision of his country's future.
He's an excellent public figure, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesauaulkoyotl, also known as Syudad-Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the walled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden beneath the highway stacks, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also of a severe nature in this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to quell drug-trafficking gangs in these areas; violence against women is particularly acute.
In the desert near a large landfill, dozens of dead women have been found in the past two years alone.
More than a thousand women were murdered in the state of Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Pena Nieto, far more than in the infamous city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name when it comes to murdering innocent women.
According to Mr. Pena Nieto's opponents, at best, he has been unable to deal with the issue of women's murder during his time as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of ignoring the issue altogether.
Residing in a concrete house, similar to most homes in this ageing area, Irene Boendian is struggling to hold back her tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official story, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was murdered by her roommate.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked like her body had been washed before", recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body was already in the woods.
Mariana's mother recounted the story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to a cross with only one word written on it: justice.
That's what they say this family was denied.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip girl, a disgruntled peace-breaker.
They want people to just take what they say for granted and shut up.
But it's wrong, it's not right, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around", she says.
By wrapping the presidential oath on Saturday, President Pena Nieto will take on a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has vowed to make solving this problem a priority during his presidency.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the governor", says Olvera, a PRI congressman from Valle de Bravo.
But that's what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nescabad fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to disprove Bradley Manning's claims about poor conditions in custody.
During the hearing, much attention was paid to Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is calling for the case to be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions were harsh.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, prosecutors tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had missed the many opportunities he had to file a complaint about the mistreatment he said he had endured while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein stated that records of Manning's weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, contain no complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-examination of the defense's motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and sufficient punishment in themselves was conducted the day after Manning stated that while in custody he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were later published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fein and Manning reviewed reports that were filled in after Manning was visited by officials during his time in Quantico prison, where he was held under strict confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the prison administration's treatment of him to be "preferable" and the general conditions of his imprisonment to be "very professionally organized".
The reports examined contain no complaints of ill-treatment, although Manning was directly questioned about the conditions of his detention, Fein claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concern about these issues orally and that administration officials who had visited him discussed these issues with him and said they would address them, but did not record it in writing.
"They recorded 'no problems' (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring up the subject in the conversation", says Manning.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of mistreatment in January 2011 during a commission hearing about his suicide plans, which he had written out months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get his "trauma prevention" regime removed and his prison terms relaxed.
Military officials explained that a restricted detention regime - lower than the surveillance regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know I was okay, that they were going to cancel the trauma prevention program... that my life would improve, in my view", Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at the Naval Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had suicidal thoughts in Kuwait and that he had lost consciousness one day because of the heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult not to let you know how your destiny is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to the size of Camp Arifan, to the size of my prison", Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in this cage".
While in Quantico, Manning said, he spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in total solitude.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave a mattress, a blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, because sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime was prohibited by the rules.
Manning said that during sleep, he was constantly struck by light penetrating from outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around in bed at night, he said, they woke him up and forced him to turn around.
Manning's lawyer formally objected to the wrongful treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before guards and other prisoners at the morning checkpoint.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself in a blanket during the inspection.
In response to a judge's question on Friday, Manning said he learned from the guard's order that he should drop the blanket he could cover himself with, but admitted that no one had directed him to drop it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported telling the officer that he could use a rubber coat or a pair of scissors to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to live through while in custody and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it planned to offer Manning a plea of guilty to lesser charges and to challenge the other charges as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico under strict rules governing the detention of detainees.
The charges against Manning include aiding an enemy, illegally facilitating the publication of data on the Internet, transmitting information relating to national defense, and stealing state property or documents.
If convicted on all charges, he could face life in prison.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of a Mexican-American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrete believes that Mexican Americans are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down a corridor, approached a border control area, and froze.
The signs pointed to two rows: one for Mexicanos (Mexicanos), the other for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I came to the complex design of "American of Mexican descent".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and I got in line for the Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda of the meetings of the presidents of these countries was on immigration, drugs and trafficking.
President Penia Nieto was eager to talk about the Mexican economy's rise, which would allow Mexicans to now, with the same success, stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Penia Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old-fashioned issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and, under the guise of rifle fire, forced its leaders to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
So it's only fair for any US statesman to speak a word of criticism of Mexico, and the press and the elite of Mexican society are immediately complaining that Americans are invading the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montessori are full of war.
The most complex is Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the offense?
They're good enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who don't.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican descent for one reason only: at some point in their family history, someone -- father or grandfather -- didn't have the opportunity to establish themselves in Mexico and was forced to move north.
Most of them were Mexican people of a certain type - slumbers, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Our lives today are the fulfillment of the American dream, we've been to good schools and gotten good jobs, but let's not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and vague, but we know which country to consider our own.
The United States of America.
And we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We answer them the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as unreal Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties to Mexico aren't strong enough.
Our very existence is a failure for them.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain finding a life in the United States but losing our spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved to the U.S. legally as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans -- Mexicans have a clearer understanding of their national identity, and that's offensive to Mexican Americans.
She's a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my Mexican-American acquaintances don't feel like they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also like Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I've learned during my trip, as if our relationship is not already confused enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reestablish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to be some kind of ambassador to Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a wonderful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course I did.
It's not gonna work.
Too many offences in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, the corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is that beautiful.
I'm sorry, but you can handle this yourself, Amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can't forgive the United States the way they did Mexico a century and a half ago, they'll have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent are still upset about how they treated their relatives in Mexico recently.
I did.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for a future peace
Is there a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There have been routine, meaningless debates about who started the first one; many buildings have been destroyed; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen for the first time in the conflict around Israel's capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopelessness of the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, the Middle East has changed.
There are many different ways to look at this, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded many established realities in a tumultuous storm, and the Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay out of the storm that has shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will be even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for hope to break through this deadly deadlock.
A war without winners
At first glance, the situation is not a cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire agreement signed on November 21 is upheld, this week's clashes have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the group's leaders have been killed and 1.7 million people trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River - another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is running out.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
A reviving regional leader, Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has backed Hamas; its example has been followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamically developing states in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas supporters are claiming to have an Islamic crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, ruled by Hezbollah's militant group, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king's government threatens Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred at the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, Egypt, where under President Mohamed Morsi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was ousted in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is an organization that is very similar to Hamas, and its leaders are more populist.
In future diplomatic settlements, Hamas could become a major player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard line" in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile defense system justified the cost of its construction and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas missiles launched.
The citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States has remained true to its unchanging position; many European countries have also blamed the beginning of the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Although about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly through a wall that enters the West Bank - much of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu's position, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - has joined forces with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What's the point of enslaving the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If we hand over all the power in the West Bank, won't they launch rockets from there toward Israel, like their fellow Gaza Stripers do?
Better to keep them behind the wall and stiffly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
The hardliners may win, but their calculations may be disproved by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be domestic issues.
Israel's defense budget is bigger than all its Arab neighbors combined.
A war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, in no small measure, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change moves in Arab countries, the Palestinian denial of self-determination is a slow-moving bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement are being paid for by growing international discontent.
Both sides need an outside impulse.
The only solution that remains is one that the sane representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are constantly calling for: the formation of two states and Israel's ceding of territories in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the sides of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long decided to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and Qatar, have a more favorable position than ever to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967 in the light of the sharing of territory and the shared use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the forthcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows a reluctance to join the solution.
It's a catastrophic shortsighted position.
The United States is vital to stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible with a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, a law on the unified packaging of cigarettes has come into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of affected body parts are contrasted on dark green boxes, identical for all cigarette brands.
Australia's first ever law on the uniform packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color scheme of different brands with a gloomy olive box with scary images of sick body parts and images of children whose health is impaired by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various paintings and inscriptions warning of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packages that are mandatory from this Saturday is the names of the stamps that are printed in the same small font.
These are the toughest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says that the aim of the measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of their harmful fashion status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that 99 out of 100 people who did not start smoking before age 26 never became smokers.
"It is clear that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies try to convey by packaging", explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest smoking rates in the world, so these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of multinational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Tobacco industry officials strongly opposed the passage of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the black market share of cheap and affordable cigarettes.
"This bill will have serious consequences unlike those that were envisioned by its initiators", says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit goods from China and Indonesia will supply far more of these goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, the new laws are promoting business growth.
Sandra Ha of the small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that demand for portcagals and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on packaging has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies like British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in Australia's highest court, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesale businesses and is expecting a new batch.
It's a good business for us.
Experts say that the popularity of social media is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
After Australia passed a series of laws that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, and prohibited sellers from displaying cigarettes in public places, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from posting ads online, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a tobacco salesman and you're left with just this little loophole, the idea of promoting your product online is a very attractive one", explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes the rise in brand reviews written by supposedly ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
So the question is, is it really the work of a civilian who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spent his time and effort making a video, or is it the advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco's Australian office claims that the industry is more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Tobacco industry officials have even taken steps to sponsor Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: These countries are making claims to the World Trade Organization that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that all of these countries have very little trade relations with Australia.
The WTO is expected to reach a decision by mid-2013.
According to Taney Plibersek, the government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to make it mandatory to post pictures warning of the harm of smoking.
Now, this rule is in place in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are showing a lack of innovation.
I'm not interested in these pictures.
I'm just not paying attention.
"You just grab a cigarette and put it in your pocket", explains Victor El Haig, a buyer of cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in downtown Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it harder to arrange the goods on the shelves.
"I used to have an hour to unload a new batch, but now it takes four hours", he complains.
"The government should have taken and banned cigarettes altogether, and we would have said, 'What are we going to do, okay, we're going to close the store,'" he says, raising his hands.
It's not so bad to be bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections.
On this Thanksgiving, I had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical malfunction and was replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there's not much help in books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free shops.
However, in recent years, more and more children's development experts and scientists have expressed support for boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it's not so bad for us and our children to miss.
It forces the brain to focus on interesting related topics, which may help creativity.
And because in today's world, we're all constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom are passed on.
Maybe we should strive for boredom.
I'm not.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many others, that boredom was an invention of the recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Twy, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin inscriptions about boredom have been found, dating back to the first century.
And the question remains, how do we understand boredom?
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an adjunct professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the understanding and view of boredom has often changed.
After studying research on the subject and asking a question to a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following conclusion: Boredom is when people "want but cannot do what will satisfy them".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do something he would like to do.
You don't want to do anything with apathy.
He says that the main cause of boredom is "a loss of attention and associated mood swings and a feeling that time is slowing down".
Boredom can be described as very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, those who are bored see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and those who are depressed see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when it's really just hard to focus.
In their study "Bedroomed Mind: Defining Boredom from the Point of View", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues cite an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading a journal.
Some participants also heard loud noises from a non-affiliated television program in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so they could barely be heard, and the third group listened only to a voice recording without an external sound track.
Those who listened to low-volume TVs reported being bored, more often than others - having difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the cause and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, distraction can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "like looking through a supply chain in search of a marriage, distracting music can help us avoid boredom".
He goes on to say that when people start to roll around in a chair or draw a paperwork, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that actually doing so just helps keep them physically relaxed.
"The study showed that children who are not prohibited from flipping and rolling learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly", says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all get bored, like being delayed on a flight, listening to a monotonous speech, watching a movie that's not interesting.
However, different people have different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special "boredom scale" to measure these individual characteristics.
To determine a score on this scale, we use questions and statements like, "A lot of what I have to do is one-sided and monotonous" or "I'm too interested in too much, so there's no time for anything".
Using these questionnaires, researchers found that boys miss girls more often, says Stephen Wodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers often miss each other.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he used a pager to connect with nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
The results were as follows: 32% of teens reported being bored at school and doing their homework, and 23% reported being bored outside of school.
And only 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what this boredom data would be like 21 years from now.
However, he knows that "the peak of boredom occurs in adolescence", largely because children and adolescents are not fully allowed to decide what to do.
So back to my original question: Is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, research shows, it can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical activity, risky gambling, or substance abuse in an effort to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have pondered the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Wodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
"That's how our brains tell us to do something else; that's boredom", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But that brain itself doesn't always know what the best thing to do is.
If you're bored and you put that energy into playing guitar or cooking, you'll do better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and his occupation", says Professor Fenske.
"And these self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations", he says.
Your child is not only learning to do things on his own, he is also learning to control himself in general.
I don't think boredom is something to be praised.
But it's not a bad thing to think of.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"We see this as a way to get bored more often, whereas boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful", he says.
People actually want to sort of cut off their constant worries and just relax.
"In today's world, we are accustomed to constantly over-stimulating our senses", he says, "and when silence strikes, we lose sight of what to do".
It's unclear how the new marijuana law will be enforced in Colorado.
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old soccer player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a criminal offense that will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: keeping a small portion of marijuana and a pipe he smoked in.
Mr. Orosco says that one September, he and his friends were in Lamar driving a car down the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by the police.
After a police officer discovered marijuana in the car, Ms. Orozco was summoned to court for possession of narcotics and a device for drug use - petty offences punishable by a fine of $100 each - and a court date has been set.
"We are treated like criminals", says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has persisted for weeks after Colorado voted to legalize recreational small amounts of marijuana, the resolution of hundreds of small-scale legal cases depends not so much on the law as on the venue.
Small-scale marijuana-related charges have already been filed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken similar action.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 years and older for keeping low doses, which will be legal once the law goes into effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative counties in Colorado, prosecutors have decided to consider existing marijuana-related cases and continue to hold the drug liable.
At the same time, some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous West have voted to ban the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores.
"It's happening so fast, I don't even know what to expect", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, a city east of Denver.
The Washington State regulators are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They must form rules to determine the licensing process for the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in addressing marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for recreation.
"Colorado is a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example", explains Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council on Alcohol Production and Sales in Washington State.
But now, Mr. Smith admits, there is nothing more anyone can do than make suggestions and hope that they work.
"We don't have a real precedent to look at", he says.
Washington State's bill, called I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and will leave the state in a state of uncertainty for a year when there is no state licensing system yet and marijuana possession is already legal.
And there are still some very difficult technical issues that need to be addressed in this period, like how to balance the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a 1,000-foot ban on commercial use from schools, parks, playgrounds, and kindergartens.
"It will be especially difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses in the city, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs", explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed Marijuana Legalization Center research group.
On November 21, the Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his subordinates that the city prosecutor's office would no longer prosecute persons under the age of 21 for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that police would stop prosecuting people for the violations "from this point on".
Police Chief Oates said police will monitor the city's compliance with the regulations governing the activities of persons who grow marijuana for medical purposes and will prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
Well, the District Attorney for the Northern District of Colorado, Ken Buck, is taking a more rigorous approach to this.
After the vote on the bill, he said the prosecutor's office would continue to hold marijuana liable, primarily to encourage marijuana users to undergo treatment.
At this time, 119 individuals have been charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many are charged with other offences.
"Our institution's duty is to prosecute those who are considered to be criminals at the time of their commission", Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like Mesa Rural District, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer hold minors liable for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hautsinger supported the decision, but he also decided not to drop charges in the open marijuana case.
"I believe that it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes", he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the decision, incorporating recreational marijuana into the public and legal system will not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of residents in different parts of the state has exposed the ambiguity of the state's government's attitude toward the marijuana experiment.
"The district attorneys have a cultural barrier to this", explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana convicts and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have been persecuting people for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime", he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, are destined to become a nationwide experimental field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalisers and state officials plan to expand the legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxiously awaiting directions from federal authorities, which still plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will back down on the issue.
Despite several widespread arrests of merchants and patients using marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government has mostly approved the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small pack of marijuana, but they will hardly turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are permitted under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug counsel.
Some cities in Colorado didn't wait for federal action.
Even before the presidential election, some local authorities approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana stores, which could not open for more than a year.
Last week, Montreux, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month marijuana ban, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we give someone a license and then it causes serious problems at the federal level", says Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many unresolved questions.
Petronella White: I was saved from Oxford because I was a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their beliefs did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother went to Oxford and described it as the best institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the foundations of civilization -- freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at the University of Oxford's College of Wooster in the late 1980s, I packed my suitcases and left, which led to the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it and he cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard reported that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from a strawberry cup.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was poisoned for one reason only, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it seemed like true barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a conservative myself.
You might ask, why do we need to remember that now?
According to recent data, a new generation of right-wing centrist students are being harassed in the same way.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection for their rights as those of disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the Corpus Christi College student club in Cambridge claim that they are "often actively isolated, attacked and made to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to add an additional representative to the College's Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only compounded by the recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right", in which conservatives were portrayed as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
The film depicts Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford Conservative Association, riding in a rolls-roose, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver dagger.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are being "dismissed for higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham Conservative Association, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "the university environment is increasingly left-wing.
People who don't even know us, they're going to think of us as the naughty, impunely violent children of rich parents".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Corpus Christi College's history department who has been asked to step up the defense, calls the atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Oxford Conservative Association, says that the student club's attitude toward right-wing centrists has deteriorated significantly.
"This poses a threat to both the intellectual discussion atmosphere and the normal lives of the club members", she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I entered in September 1986 as a shy, shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverishly hated by the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary degree because of the cut in the university's budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first few days of my freshman week, when students were getting to know each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was ahead of me.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the conservative student grassroots movement, but they also enjoyed participating.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and the government's refusal to impose sanctions on the apartheid government in South Africa - were permeating the wooden-panelled walls of the auditorium.
At my first seminar, I had to translate an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't ready for what followed.
"Miss White", said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph".
I was having a hard time getting the text, so I kept it in my mouth.
Harry Pitt was a very galling man with a cake-like face.
"Do the Tatcherists teach French in principle or do they simply lack brains?" he asked.
The other students were screaming.
I was tears in my eyes.
"I would advise you to take some basic French lessons in your spare time, if you are not too busy hanging out in public", said Pete.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting alone at lunch; then someone slapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a sophomore in the English department, who introduced himself as a member of the university's Conservative Association.
"I know who you are", he said amicably.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being a conservative would be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour".
Later, at a local pub, I cowardly tried to be a hypocrite.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A first-year philosophy, politics and economics student who studied at Eton himself said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious".
The other students picked up on his words.
I was dirty, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" one of them asked.
- They're beating each other, aren't they?"
I felt like I must have felt like a homosexual before the end of the criminal justice system in the '60s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet like-minded people only under cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour Party member and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her spokesmen.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised it for its provinciality, its smallness and its commitment to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London, seeking refuge among relatives and impartial friends in the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his forties there were all kinds of political views.
"But it's the best university in the world", he said complainingly.
- They can't do that, except in a city of sleeping spires...
Even my communist friends have always been flawless".
His wet eyes were blurred.
"Don't make decisions in a hurry.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college".
I was tired of the constant travels to London and my emotional defense was weak.
My friend, also a conservative, could not resist the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me "enemy of the people" in a very serious way, I decided to do the same.
In a state of shame, I confessed that my parents brainwashed me and called them "old fools".
The break was short.
The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was meant to hit my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for Rupert Murdoch's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a plax and a rag.
But at 18, no one should be subjected to such outrage and intimidation in a school.
Worse still, it was Oxford that not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind the unmerited reputation of an equal and free-thinking university.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the "Valentino: Master Seam" exhibition, which opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Natti Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Gharavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino: The Seammaster", a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "Il Signor" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first hall of the exhibition, open until March 3, is full of personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social upheaval: from a modest portman in the northern Italian city of Vogere to the idols of the international "elite".
There's nothing wrong with being in love with a royal court.
"They don't even put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous rug like some great pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a unique host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved going to his shell in Gstaad", explains ex-wife Heini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Angelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, playing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic fashion designer.
We went to his house for dinner one day, after a fashion show in the Plaza de España in Rome, many years ago.
Among the 20 guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was evident in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in her food, in her music.
"Valentino made each of the guests feel important and loved", recalls the "top model", whose work with the model began in 1995 during Paris High Fashion Week.
"It never goes out of style because its sketches are real works of art", she concludes.
The family parade
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous, 60-foot-long podium that offers a changing of the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must delve through the podium, gazing at the "people" from the grass that glitter with Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti used in "Night", or the coat of fur and leather that belonged to Empress Fara Dibba.
In this audience, models such as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg are among the brightest.
Natti Abaskal and a fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember him very well.
These were pants, a shirt, a vest and jackets from the fall-winter 1971-72 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me", says one of the designer's muses, Natti Abaskal.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess de Ferria.
I love the colors he uses, they're bright and they're good for his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion lawmaker Patricia Della Jowampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dresses up in Valentino either.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would be old enough to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that hour came in the late 1990's.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a sash, a folding body and a slash without a bracelet.
"It was a dream that came true", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her wedding dresses from a designer with "maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories that go with it".
The King of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Santal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seams) to make this outfit out of ivory-colored silk with a pearl incrustation, twelve different types of circles and a four-and-a-half-meter-high shelf.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the most respected authority on the specialized press, the dress represents the high fashion peak of the late 20th century, "the return of customers from the higher world".
For many years, the "lifestyle" of the elite has deceived Valentino, and he is now the best representative of it.
Knight of the Grand Cross (the highest rank in Italy), Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honours as any of his clients' spouses.
"I was always impressed by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and flawless appearance", says D. Arenberg.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a dinner party at the Musee d'Orsay.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribé, my old friend.
"He was impeccable, there is no time for him".
If the princess says so...
The toughest profession in the world: Kawah-Ijen miners
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by smuggling 70 kilograms of sulfur up the volcano's summit along steep rocky paths
Some people think their jobs are hell, and some people literally work in hell.
Among them was Antonio Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living from the Kawah-Ijen volcano, located east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Antho descends to the bottom of the crater, where sulfuric gas rising from the Earth's depths freezes when it comes into contact with the air.
He puts up huge pieces of sulfur, which can weigh up to 70 kg, in two bamboo baskets, and he puts them on his shoulders and carries them up a rugged rocky road.
The volcano, which is 2,386 feet (2,386 m) high, is only 250 feet (250 m) high, but exhausted loaders take more than 40 minutes to climb with a turtle-like step, struggling to maintain balance and carefully stepping on the road so as not to fall or fall from the edge.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who broke off the Cavache-Igen rocks a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah-Ijeen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once they're up there, they're paving a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were a circus monkey and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, they're walking three kilometers to the weights that the mining company has placed a little higher, at 1,850 meters.
The company, which has been operating the volcano since 1960, and, better yet, its employees, is paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) to petrochemical companies, since it is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Because it is normal to carry 70 kilograms, we make about 46,000 rupees (US$36,000) for each walk", explains Antonio, who normally moves three times a day.
He spends three hours on each and feels broken at the end, but they allow him to save 138,000 rupees by the end of the day.
Although it may seem a pity for such a dishuman effort, it's three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wage for miners is very high by local standards, where coffee collection costs 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros)", explains a freighter who used to work as a stonemason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees a day and the plot was not so heavy, but he returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that is as devastating as the grimness of Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where there are only Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, constant coughing, and he's tearing his eyes out of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Antô spent three years risking himself in Kavach-Ijén, whose gray matter had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, he coughs constantly, and he's tearing his eyes out because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel porter, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, he gets up every day at two o'clock at night because the grey never stops leaking at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines through the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Antô descends into a crater, illuminating his way with a small light attached to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
About 400 people carrying grey baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite its high profits, the mining company has not mechanised the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they don't even receive a portion of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo fee, which, along with a 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance ticket, the reserve's guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its people-mulls.
"This is a job for cattle, not people", says Badrusin, a 42-year-old corn bearer who has spent three decades at Kawah-Ijeen since leaving college.
He can lift up to 110 pounds, and he says he will work "as long as he can" because he needs money to pay for the education of his three children, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the thick pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains about their severe illnesses... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knee pain and shoulder ulcers that have been deformed by the weight of the basket.
Balancing his back, Unainic can now lift only 50 pounds at age 53.
Each day, he and his companions remove 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a storage facility in Tamasari, traveling 18 kilometers along a narrow pathway among the bushes.
"I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano is my whole life", Unailik says, opening his mouth wide, missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works as a sulphur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates one of the most difficult jobs in the world, from generation to generation, the work of human mullahs from Kawah-Ijin.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and housing and education costs for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
I am a patriot husband, you are a patriot wife, we will fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the pepperoni advertising, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put the bao (cow) in the oven" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made the video, BBH, is hoping to use advertising to bring attention to the issue in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to help people fulfill their "national duty".
This thing is for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
That's the biggest problem in the country.
We're the worst breeders in the world, so we felt that this was the topic we needed to address.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot, like run pheromone spirits or organize quick dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't have to work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, and that is to compose rap?
1.2 child
Who doesn't take this lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for spouses and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all of this is low-efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Administration, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 -- what's known as the replacement percentage -- was 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the National Population Office's Office of Marriage and Family Policy, says that "improved education" and "a wider range of career opportunities" are the reasons.
"It has allowed people to have a wider range of options for life goals and priorities beyond marriage and family", she explains.
These changes in social norms are contributing to the rise in single people and postponing marriages and childbirth, which has led to a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline, is provoking outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where a barely concealed xenophobia is thriving against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are being criticized for keeping wages low and refusing to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that Singapore's ruling party scored the worst result in elections since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have a known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending, and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making every effort to keep the houses from being so small.
For example, it's starting to affect the real estate sector.
The city development guide has moved to controlling the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46-square-foot apartments are selling very well.
However, there is speculation that they may promote a single-family lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of homebuilding firm EL Developers, says their shoe boxes sell much faster than larger ones.
They're more popular in the sense that they buy for days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for developers who were previously hampered by too many small apartments in the project.
Too much stress.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the centre, it seems they won't have much effect.
"People are overwhelmed, housing is expensive, and education is expensive, and that's why many people put it off", says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time", says another 20-year-old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of housing and education as reasons why they are not having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word on childbirth is for Singaporeans.
Offline personal - online personal
It's a little bit of privacy.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish Language, it is a private property or "a sphere of private life that they have the right to protect from any interference".
What is personal for a minor under 16?
How does he apply this definition to his daily life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing situations online that he would not share offline?
ElPeriódico interviewed five teenagers aged 10 to 15 who were frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very personal", in a personal plane, and "password and username" when applied to social media.
"I wouldn't upload my biggest secrets to a post", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of personal information on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the world", he says.
I'm uploading beautiful pictures or pictures from games on FB.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine or someone else's stupid", he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to post indecent photos of naked people, crimes, or write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mom knows she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm just uploading them", he adds.
"Social media is fun, and I can talk to my distant relatives or friends faster", he says.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on anyone to recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has an open account on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter he admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music", he says.
The boy said no one had ever trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I will simply delete them from my account", he admits.
Jose became an Ask follower after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to what is known today as cyber mobbing.
A friend of mine's been blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and asked for money.
"He never knew who it was", he assures.
Victim said Jose didn't delete the account.
"Just turned on the privacy".
It then explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
"I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key questions
Marjeles Porras, an English teacher and education and learning expert, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, we need to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a tool for finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a professor of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are them, children and youth born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning ourselves", she says.
He explains that this is a difficult topic, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what they can or cannot distribute, publish or speak at an age when there is not enough maturity to do so".
"Also, they should be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is is is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless", she adds.
And then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like a photo of you to be published like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what other people are saying about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask other people for permission to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online just like they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility, and other principles, and so should social media", she says.
Keeping an Eye on It
Eduardo Guardia, a university lecturer, elementary education professor, and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of these points, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published", he says.
According to Gaurdi, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
UNASUR summit ends without the publication of the Lim Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNESCO) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lime Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th UNASUR meeting of Heads of State and Government, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the homepage that it would be forwarded after closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the Peruvian government website.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content was presented by Peruvian President Olyanto Umal during brief press releases.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound, with the message "closed session, sound prohibited".
A little information circulated among reporters was given by press secretaries of some UNASUR governments who were present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused the discontent of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
The Peruvian presidential administration later sent a media email with the summit's "final declaration", but it's about Umalla's statement, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite press pressing demands, the so-called Lime Declaration, which had been previously announced, was not published.
The official website of the ASPA can be checked to see if the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that all journalists were provided with a broadcast system, but they restricted access to information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also ended with Chile and Peru jointly deciding to accept the ruling of the Hague Court, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Olianto Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins hearing the statements of both sides in The Hague on Monday, as part of the indictment that Lima has brought against Santiago.
"We will comply with and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences we are currently bringing to this international court", Umala said, alongside his Chilean colleague.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of disputes, pacts and international tribunals", Pinera added, welcoming Umal with a wave of arms against the flags of the two countries.
Both presidents' confirmation of their compliance with the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia this week protested the Bogotá Pact, which recognized its compliance with the international court's rulings following a decision on its maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it deemed wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR was suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The president-elect, Olianto Umala, was responsible for opening the talks in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon Lime time.
The head of state read the final document, which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 projects were approved among South American countries, the amount of the proposed investments amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements he mentioned, UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreements".
He said action was being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase access to medicines, affordable Internet access in all parts of South America, and to take the risks of natural disasters into account in a collective and effective manner".
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not be a triumphal foundation, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities", Umala added.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve connectivity across South America, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes", the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are Peruvian and are limited to cross-axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at greater connectivity with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-joining of the Union of South American Nations", from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united and to have good relations with its neighbors was another topic underlined at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he would begin his regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to conduct a respectful negotiation on a maritime dispute as a result of the ruling of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the Nicaragua pact will require discussions with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this as civilized and respectfully as possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also during the summit, the bloc's defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is the goal that "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the VI Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNESCO) in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland".
He defended, in this context, the South American citizenship bill, which UNASUR member states endorsed.
"We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to put us back in the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also supported the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Human Rights Pact.
Those who lecture never take any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for demanding that they come to his territory to be questioned about an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish law itself considers it possible to carry it out through a video conference that could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of damage to Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What is really at stake is the danger of his physical and mental health deteriorating from confinement to a small space without the possibility of exercising in the air.
"It affects the health of every person", he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to Assange's asylum issue, provided since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London by providing a guarantee of inviolability that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We're not negotiating human rights, which is not the word we use here, but we've had a lot of discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies with the UK, Sweden and the European courts because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is in the hands of various European courts", he said.
He said that "if Britain provides a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will be over".
And if Sweden, as it is perfectly allowed by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interviews Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or Skype him, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to speak out as a champion of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this regard, he was satisfied that neither these journalists nor "the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador" and added that being re-elected would "deepen the revolution to continue the development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality", because in reality "it has destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "fully justified" his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos' desire to negotiate with Nicaragua now on the maritime boundaries between the two countries following a ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague that was in favor of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At this time, this decision is not being complied with.
It's a problem between South and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go together.
We need to work on them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope that the maritime border dispute in Peru and Chile would be resolved in the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to go to international courts if the two countries agree to make a decision, however difficult it may be".
As for running for a third consecutive term in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, he said he was "greatly optimistic and happy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I've never been interested in power, but in unfair situations like Ecuador, the only way to fix socioeconomic poverty is through political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then we'll be out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"It's a decision", he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment that was already scheduled, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chavez's health is deteriorating", he explained.
The head of state of Ecuador took part today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNESCO), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he was told his AIDS test was positive.
"I felt like I was deaf", he recalls that difficult, despite the doctor's tact, moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it, and his efforts were worth it - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he entered in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He's been living with the human immunodeficiency virus for 22 years, and it would have been hard to believe in the early '90s -- there were too few treatments then, too few people knew about the disease, too many people were biased.
So even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Institute of Social Protection refused to say goodbye to him "because he had a cut".
In other words, having AIDS was a sentence back then.
Now it's possible to survive the syndrome and do it without deteriorating quality of life.
Yet, many people still come to the hospital unaware of their illness when the virus has already damaged their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the world's first reported cases of AIDS, at least, "the greatest achievement so far is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same", said HCG HIV chief Jaime Andrade Vilyanueva, citing a prestigious scientific publication in April.
Infectious disease expert and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Vilyanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the length and quality of life depends on the degree of immune system impairment that patients have at the time of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy in those who don't use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4s, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4s are reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person diagnosed HIV positive at age 25, according to these terms, "with control, can live without problems until age 75", he explained.
To assess this progress, we need to remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNICEF's annual report), and it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been recorded as of May this year; however, it is claimed that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it is, that's how things are in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of medication, and the problem is that patients arrive very late because they don't know their infection status, which is, they're in the late stages of the disease.
He cited the overwhelming data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some sort of opportunistic infection; what we need to do to make a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore we need to provide mass-detection samples to all people who ask for it".
The proposal is a joint venture between experts and officials at the State AIDS Council in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients like Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for testing, motivated by the fact that his friend had done it and, despite his young age, had already been diagnosed with AIDS and even suffered from Kaposhi sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"I'd rather get laid three times a week if I died anyway", they say.
I'm having positive changes, eating well, exercising, taking medication.
To date, all his parents know is that he has cancer.
I'm living a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, taking care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to promote his statement to those who are now experiencing fear in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them check for a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, so better, and if they've already been diagnosed, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year.
Condoms on the shelf
There is a huge gap between health programs and the average citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has been working on the HIV problem.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the spread of condoms has actually increased, we used to get one or two, now we get a hundred packs, which is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don't have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why are they for you?" is a popular question, with much indignation and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health workers who don't want to hear from teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I suggest changing this inefficient distribution, so that condoms are not just behind the shelves, and that hundreds of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people frequent.
It's not about promoting promiscuity.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if he could hand out condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already engaged in sexual activity", he said.
Key data in Halico
There are 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV cases).
The state ranks fourth in the national rankings for new and total AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% through blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as there are four to five people per reported case who are unaware of it.
Given the United States Court of Appeals' ratification of a decision that nullifies the restructuring of Vitro Group debt achieved through a tendering procedure in Mexico, the scenario sets a deadline for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has problems with its solvency.
It seems that the survival support procedures allowed by Mexican law are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the approval of a June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale in the Northern District of Texas Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican firms vulnerable to the possibility of seizing their property across the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door for a leading glassmaker in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge in the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans says the main proceedings concern a competition case being heard in Mexico.
The first clause implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on Unification of International Trade Law was created to do so, setting the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Second, the verdict establishes that without an inter-company vote, the debts recognized in the critical mass of competition production that Vitro's subsidiaries had before the parent company would not have reached the majority needed to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro wasn't the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts are guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Manufacturing.
It is also true that if the votes of the subsidiaries were to be taken out, Vitro's creditors, who have fought against it in the United States courts, namely, "startups" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal has dismissed this.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that hit the United States, striking the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sade family firm will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenum, that is, five judges, given that only three voted.
If it fails, a petition for certiorari will be filed, which will require a review of the case by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worse, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae ("court friend") describing the process that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, signaling that it is exempting itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to bind it to Section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
It also notes that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency that guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
A two-deck carriage: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
The overall balance
Given the months-long delay in the complaints filed by Mexicana de Aviación's trade unions against the company's former owner, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Airline Pilots' Union has already discovered a bottle of garlic.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to submit reports to the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic regarding an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund F/589 of IXE Bank on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be directed to the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarrag Andrade is the main shareholder of Posadas.
Surrounding Dragon Mart
Gathering at a weekend forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean countries of an isolated country with a residential area nearby for 150 employees.
Canacintra had previously managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to counter the monumental forces that leveled some of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
Death of the ACTA
As to the government's rejection of the Senate's demand to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA in English, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already gone to the archives.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of treating it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, homebuilder Homex is placing 500 million pesos of Exchange certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones, with interest payments offered every 28 days.
Competival is coming out.
Founded by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, the Competival consortium has just begun, aiming to market software cluster services in Central and South America.
The investment in this area is over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hettin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball enthusiast Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in the sport for over 60 years and has traveled the world with it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many basketball stories as Hector "Hatin" Reyes.
And before a brain hemorrhage tied him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a minor league player, Major League Baseball player, a commissioner and BSN executive with the Bayamon Cowboys and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I've played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation in the '90s", Reyes recalls during a visit to Primera Hora's home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating in making that claim.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected during his long journey, bear witness to this.
The heart of the beam
He is most passionate about those who remember his journey through the Cowboys, beginning in the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated 15 years as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey made his BSN debut.
From that moment on, Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the "Coco" who led the company", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was on his way here at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7".
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Mincie, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who became a citizen and one of our top bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsey brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help win another.
I enjoyed the Cowboys Championship with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By then, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minsi's achievements in the national team.
I remember winning our first U.S. Olympic qualifier in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, and it should have been bronze, if not for the Canadian referee who made us win the final, Reyes said.
That 1990 World Cup team is the best team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was pretty much like the one we won bronze at the World Championships.
The team not only included Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortiz), but also younger (Havier) 'Tonito' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in the 90s due to knee injuries.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a lot of joy, was the team for the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neukene, Argentina.
With the likes of Canito Nieves, Pablo Alisea and the younger Roland Hurruitner, instead of players suspended for the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performances at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Piculin did.
And that's not counting his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I'm a young man who likes Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in the BSN there were up to 17 teams per season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, like, regionalise smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys play only in their own area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the kids are traveling and playing too much, and that's all it takes.
At least I see the results of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It's a pleasure.
What are you doing?
I listen to music most of the time, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been there for me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a principled, evil, manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon-predator Jay Ar Ewing in the 1980s television series Dallas became a symbol of greed, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night from complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he liked most", his family said.
Larry's family and best friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and its sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, sweet, and talented, and I'm gonna miss him a lot.
"He was an original person and lived a full life", Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained television fame for his role as a decent type in the light comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive female genius played by Barbara Eden and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the main character in two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hegman to the top of the heap.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its circle aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who Shoot J.R.?" advertising slogan, designed to create a buzz around the episode, full of emotion, in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated international controversy and millions of dollars that were risked at bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record-breaking audience at the time.
When the response was given in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it, making Dallas the second most-watched entertainment program in history, after the 1983 finale of MASH, which drew 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn't get out of town, but others had reasons to attack him too.
Hagman played Ewing as a greedy corrupt with a charismatic smile: an unfair businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put on treatment.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s gravestone", said Hagman in 1988.
It should be said, "Here lies an honest citizen, J.R. Ewing".
It's the only deal he's ever lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as "a huge person on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of devotees around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Five episodes of the second season have already been completed and the sixth is in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet made any announcements about what will happen to the series after Hagman leaves.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who had a prolific career in classical music, such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater scene in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married the young Swedish artist May Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he published his memoirs, "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I did not include anything that I thought could hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began promoting organ donation and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help patients who were experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's gonna be a little awkward for a while, but you're gonna be fine".
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course that explores the end of the world begins.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharme decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible temptation: the end of the long reversal of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people had taken as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was coming in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Sandy hurricane, the financial crisis that some call "the long Armageddon", and the escalating conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all", Sharma told Rutgers University students this week.
If you look at what's happening in the world right now, like we only have 30 days left, that was a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor who's offering end of the world courses this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Walker is reading a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time", he said, "and the way hypothetical scenarios are proposed to cause certain human actions".
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed the films on apocalyptic themes and explored how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be, probably might be true and what might not be", Walker said.
On the main campus of Penn State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solary, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, gathered to read a course called simply "End of the World".
"We're not adding '2012' to always be able to read the course again, in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "inevitable destruction", students must study, prepare projects and pass final exams.
Penn State's final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night when the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"The seats were up in two hours", Restall said of his high-school graduation course, which had 35 students enrolled.
We'd get emails for weeks before the semester from people asking if there was more room.
Students, in turn, say that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch people do things to comfort themselves", said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the department of religion and sociology at Rutgers-Camden in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Vakes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this", he noted.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone the professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project involved Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that has existed for centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in speculation.
"In other places people don't think about it", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knew of any "end of the world" course there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", he wrote, referring to the ruling of the higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Ristel noted that there had been talk of many days of the Last Judgment for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 would be the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are not concerned about this date.
Some said they were going to the end of the world party.
"Maybe I'll call some of my friends and have a laugh", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
