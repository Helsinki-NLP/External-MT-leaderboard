Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with the lack of money to improve the crashing highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits purely on your car’s dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile carried by a motor driver and communicates that information to the officials, has become a matter of controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to rescue the system that has become old to finance major U.S. roads.
Generally, the tired work like highway planning has also suddenly become a matter of intense debate and living alliances.
You have met with liberal environmental groups to keep the details of the miles you drive, and possibly the places you drive - and then use this information to prepare tax bills - to raise support in favour of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is pleasant.
The American Civil Independence Association is also very concerned by raising various types of privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree on whether to do further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can go into a system in which the driver will pay for every mile set on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a truly unnecessary object for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether or not to be chosen by us," says Hassan Ikrata, who is the executive director of the Southern California Government Union, who is planning to start tracking every mile determined by motorists in California by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay.
There is technology to do so.
The main reason for this is that the country’s highway trust fund is almost bankrupt, which is funded by paying the taxes made on the gas pump by U.S. citizens.
The Americans do not buy as much gas as they did before.
Now a gallon gas car runs more than a mile.
Federal tax has not increased over the past 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians avoid raising a money in tax.
Li Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota, says, “gas tax is absolutely not tolerable.”
Their state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the payment system per mile.
They say, "in the long run it will work as the most reasonable option."
Wonx calls it Mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, because it can, for example, change the taxes to change the driving rate, which can help reduce the jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California planners are curious about this system as they are developing strategies to meet the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (A.-P.A.) also considers Black Box the most sustainable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Regional Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by driver.
Vice-President of the Police in the Region, Adrian Moore said, “It’s not just doing what’s going to the blind hole.”
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who in their report in 2011 promised Congress to move forward in the direction of payments per mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million test project last year, which included 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representative of individuals who had to go too many miles daily to work or to go to the city, the House’s leadership ended that proposal there.
However, many states and cities are moving in this direction themselves.
It has the most interested Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay a mileage fee instead of taxing gas to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Caboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support in all places.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 volunteer drivers just a while ago, drivers were very submissive to think that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Aladdin Khan, who directed the strategic and work-execution management in the Nevada Transport Department, says "The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem."
This is not what people wanted.
Along with the progress of testing, A.C.L.U. of Nevada warned on its website: “Convert this device into a complete tracking device will be quite easy.”
There is no need to develop an enormous, unbeatable technology framework-structure, which must be effectively spread to keep a record of each individual’s daily arrival and arrival.
Nevada is one of the many states, which are making every effort to portable technology, with the help of which the state could get a description of how many miles the car runs a day, but not where and when it runs.
Khan said that if you can do so, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This company was essentially not in the business of helping state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging car insurance market, where drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device it is testing, it liked highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at a certain time interval.
True Mileage chief executive Ryan Morrison said, "If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this method."
There have been some major errors in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also very few expensive and low-interference ways to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using to give different options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or again no one can choose to take any device, but can choose to pay a fixed fee based on the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this reserve can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more facilities instead of less in the device.
In New York City, transport officers are trying to develop such a taxing device, which will also facilitate paying the parking meter fee, provide "paying according to your drive" insurance, and generate a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that will be able to use to avoid motor-drivers traffic.
In the City Planning Document is mentioned, "Motor drivers will be attracted to participation in it due to the benefits it obtains."
However, some transport planners are surprised that all the discussion on payment according to the mile is a big breakthrough.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the Gulf Region of San Francisco has said that the bankruptcy highway trust fund can deal with the problem very easily by increasing Congress gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual fees may be imposed on drivers of hybrids or other cars whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their appropriate share.
The Commission’s Director of Legislative and Public Affairs, Randy Rentsheller, said, “When aspirin can work, what is the need of amulchul surgery for it.”
If we do so, millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death was caused by drowning.
Of course, his friend has been arrested by the police for hiding the goods of the day.
Police have submitted the final report of the death investigation to the court.
It is noted that on August 26 the police had rescued the body of the visible Iqbal living in the Padshahi Garden in the Zhelam Sea.
Her families accused her friends of killing her because her mobile and other items were missing.
In the report, the police said the phone and SIM of the deceased were investigated and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Sura.
The woman told her in question that this phone was given to her by a relatives of Ruhal Goher.
Ruhal also lives in the pastoral garden and he was a day-to-day witness friend.
Ruhal went to swim in Zhelam after the prayer-a-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the stuff on the edge, while Ruhal went to the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, he was not there, he had only clothes.
Rachel sought the sight, but he did not find it.
He picked up his cell phone, clock and other items and put it for his use.
He didn’t tell anyone that he was drowned.
The police told the court that the victim was killed and that it was confirmed in the postmortem.
In fact, Rouhal has been detained under Section 404 to hide the facts and things of the deceased.

This was revealed by his family friend Martel Polanko.
According to him, the three-time prime minister, Berlusconi, has married former TV anker Francesca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca's meeting with Balusconi occurred when she was a tennis activist at the Forza Italy party.
That’s where Francisca, whose relationship was being said that their relationship with Balrusconi is just demonstrated.
Berlusconi's close friend and bully-bully girl, Matteo Polanco, has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligence wedding.
This ceremony took place three weeks ago.

It was not a public ceremony.
The wedding took place in the private chapel located in the former Prime Minister's house.
No one can say anything else.
She did not go to this wedding.
He sent his blessing to the new couple.
The two married about three weeks ago, 8 or 9 October.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old 28-year-old woman was involved with Francesca Pascal.
To escape Kirkiri, Berlusconi had founded the foundation of loneliness behind his judgment.
Even in the lower areas the rain continued to stop between the sun's eye-michuli.
It has begun with it in the whole world.
The cold can be predicted by the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius, under zero in Gullmorg -0.2 degrees Celsius and in Leah -1.8 degrees Celsius.
It was the coldest in the whole country.
At the same time, the rain and snowfall have closed for strategically important Srinagar-Leh national highway traffic.
Joshua has had a heavy snowfall.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall in the mountainous areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activity of the western district, the rain period began in the high-pervetian areas of Vadi on Friday and in the lower areas, which continued until late evening.
The cold also affected the normal life.
People stayed in the houses to escape.
Meanwhile, the electricity supply in many areas also stops.
Srinagar's maximum day temperature was recorded four degrees below normal 13.7 degrees Celsius.
In the same time, the cold has increased during the night due to the rainy rain.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was 16.6 and the maximum was 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the weather department, the impact of the western disaster has begun to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.

The chief judge P. Satishivam's back refused to order to stop the media from running news about Asaram, saying he has seen every word in the media and has no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and other people.
Before that, the lawyer of Asaram accused the media of showing news about them.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They submit the case against whom, but the back was not affected by these media and refusing to interfere in the case, saying they have even more options.
Even before, the court has rejected a request to stop the media coverage.
The department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case to date.
The Mall’s group operator paid the relevant financial institutions by cutting TDS, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
Thus, the TDS’s rupees were gathered by themselves.
On this group on 17 October from Mumbai, the exploration team had taken action together with the Jaipur exploration team.
The same hard investigation found that the trader had cut the TDS but did not deposit it.
That’s why TDS’s team started action on this group on Thursday.
The risk of being sealed account was about 15 days ago on the group of this mall operator and the survey action occurred.
Narrated by this action this trader has clearly said to the tax department officials that they are not ready to pay the TDS rupees to the tax department.
The tax department is working on them by continuing to target them.
The officials investigating the case have clarified that in the event of no payment the account will be sealed by recovery action.
The demand for sweets is increasing.
The price of false and false wheels is increasing.
Chemicals are used to make sweet and bright, colourful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Food and Drug Administration department has launched a campaign against false mava and chemical sweets.
The department captured 5 thousand copies from the Mava and Quetta colony of 70 thousand from the Middle East.
The demand for sweets in the market has also increased as well as the demand for slurry from the Middle East.
In the shadows, the faulty mawe got the information department to bring Nagpur from the Middle East.
Transport garages are going to go to the mage of Nagpur.
The department took this mawe in possession, the price of which was 70 thousand rupees.
The fear of action did no one give righteousness to the mawi.
The department destroyed the unclaimed property.
The department struck about 5 thousand teaspoons on the Ghettendra Caterers located in Quetta Colony.
The chemistry called sodium hydrosulfite was used to stay bright and bright for a long day.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
The co-author of the department, S.S. Landमुख, said that the chemical sweetness and fault and false mawe’s campaign will continue.
In the next few days this campaign and information has been provided by the department for acceleration.
This can also be the result of the sweets.
The department asked the sweets businessmen to make good milk, mawe sweets.
Fake sweets and cowboys are being caused by the people.
The elected 42 senior leaders of the country’s BJP took their strong advances on the airport.
It is remarkable that the Modi BJP has come to the Bihar tour for a peaceful journey.
The family of those killed in the explosions in Pattaya is committed to bringing merhem from the side of the BJP.
It is remarkable that a total of seven explosions occurred during Narendra Modi's hunkar rally on 27 October in Pattaya.
The intention of the terrorists of the Indian Mujahideen, who were linked to the explosions, was to shut down during the rally, so that more people were killed and the atmosphere of terror became in the province.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people died in the explosions.
All of them were declared martyrs.
The party’s leaders have gone on a trip from the village on Thursday.
On the 5th of November, all of these bones will be flown together in the Ganga.
As part of this journey, it is the organization of the journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of the people killed in the explosions on Saturday morning at 7 p.m. and meet with their families.
During this offer, they will also provide five-five rupees of checks to the families of the dead.
The announcement of this economic aid has already been made.
The Indian team enthusiastic about the explosive victory in the last match on Saturday when M Chinnaswami Stadium will land in the seventh and final one day against Australia, his goal will be to occupy the series with victory.
Due to the rain, India had to win Nagpur One Day in any case to stay in the series after two consecutive one-day matches was washed, and its ballerins gave him a record victory while performing explosively, making the team matched 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has twice achieved the goal of more than 350 runs and once again the responsibility to cross the team will be on the ballerins.
The Indian ballerina is at the top at this time and the bigger goal is also being demonstrated in front of it.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhanny are in a massive form, but Yuvraj Singh, सुरेश Rana and Rवींद्र Jadeja will also have a lot of expectations for the team.
As far as the question of opning is, the team has received such a salami pair as the royalty and summit that makes the work of the rest of the ballerins easier from solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure while doing fantastic partnerships in the opening.
On the third number, Kohli has shown what Virat has done so far, he is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar.
But many cricket players have given them a better deal than Sachin.
The next week, Virat will be 25 years old, has set 17 one-day centuries, of which India has recorded 16 victories.
Their average in pursuit of the goal is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finalist.
India's top three ballerins are in a strong form, but the excessive dependency on these three can also be harmful for the team.
Rana and Yuvraj were badly floping in the last match.
Yuvraj has not yet opened in two matches in the series.
In such a way, they can do a good turn 'Lifeline' in Bengaluru OneDay.
As far as the question of Australia is, his ballerins, especially Captain George Belly, have impressed everyone with his performance.
They are also asking to go to the test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia has good balls to the ninth.
In addition to Belly, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogg and James Fockner have played a good match in the series.
However, in the opening, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not left any effect.
Missing Michelle Johnson in football could be heavy to Australia.
Johnson, who has so far performed greatly in the series, has been sent to the country for the preparations of the Ashes series.
The member and chief spokesman of the BJP National Execution, Dr. Jitendra Singh, said Pakistan is working on a new policy to penetrate terrorists.
Citing the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement on Friday that Pakistan is emphasizing the peak to push terrorists near 2000 ready in its training camps.
There will never be peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more bitter after the failure of separatists to burn people in Kashmir and massively deteriorate the situation.
Citing the past year’s Pakistan tour of separatists, the BJP leader said that ISIS chief leftenant general Zahar Ull Islam, Lashkar, Hezbollah’s Sargana Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had convinced that terrorism will be aired in 2014.
Pakistan has gotten to fulfill this promise seriously.
The murder of soldiers on the border, samba, suicide attacks in Hirangar are part of this strategy.
In such circumstances the demand to end the privileges of the army in the state is deadly, the BJP leader said that doing such things until there is permanent peace in the state is also anti-general.
They get the country’s anti-national intelligence.
He emphasized that the army of the leaders, the security forces should be stopped on the statement that falls down.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence officer, has announced that he is ready to visit Berlin to prove the parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fail to answer about his activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Bale, met with Mr. Snowden on Saturday in Russia, where he was given asylum to talk about testimony in Germany.
A letter submitted by Mr. Snow Dean to the media on Friday in Berlin, said: "Al the results of my efforts are provenly positive, my government party - recognizes the disagreement as a change, and does not provide any defense that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with the accusations of Gundagardi."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to give up criminal accusations against him.
The allegations on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice include theft of intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Minister of Internal Affairs, told online Zeit: "Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, so we will have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have come under pressure because NSA has claimed that the phone has been bugged to Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Operman, a parliamentary member who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, supervises intelligence information. said that if witness as Mr. Snowden had the opportunity to hear "the relations with the United States completely destroy and without bringing them into danger,"there should be taken.
Mr. Belley, a parliamentary member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on Twitter Feed.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Stro Belene said, according to the former NSA contractor lawyer, if they left Russia, Snowden Russia will not be able to go back.
If Snow Day witnessed in Germany, he would be "safe" there that would require guarantees, the parliamentary party said.
Mr. Snow Dean said in his letter that "he had to face an intense and sustainable campaign" because he had to be forced to leave home.
Although he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by widespread responses"to his work of political expression."
The United States, including - world citizens as well as high officials have assessed the discovery of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German officials "when the problems of human condition have been solved."
Frontier Airlines will charge on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for cargo for passengers on its aircraft board - on store.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charges for $100 for a carrier on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday announced that passengers can hold the whole box.
New Carry - on-free overhead is for bags in the bin, so, the small bags below the seat will still be free.
Frontier said that $25 will be charged if the advance is paid, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay until they are on the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Maley said that $100 per cent passengers are to get to take care of charges in advances.
“We don’t want to charge it,” he said.
The airline launched charges for the first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid charges are filled as much as they can in Carry-on baggage that is stacked in the overhead box, meaning that this box often has less space.
There is a way to bring less for passengers on the board.
O'Maley said it's not really about collecting new charges.
It has become more and more difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the place of the overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website do not have to give it.
That’s why the next person in the line may have to give $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line on a front gate can get a bag for free.
O'Maley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
Frontier's new carrier - on fee, will not start until the summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often show dissatisfaction about baggage fees and other fees, but air service likes them.
They argue that it costs money to handle the baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of flight after years of loss.
Most of them, though Carrey - on bag fees are not until touching.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched Carry-on charges for the first time three years ago, and the discount partner Allegiant Air later.
With such a fee as well as another airline is Wizz Air of Hungary, which airline adviser J. Sorensen said,and which add-on on-fee tracks.
He said that Spirit's Carey - on fee brings $50 million a year which is estimated in December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines, recently surprised the flight in Spirit and passengers had to face an unusual bag fee on the gate.
“The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was intuitive,” he said.
I was hoping to scratch my teeth and see out on a battle gate.
“The aircraft was full and they said it was lickety-split.”
Frontier also follows a $2 Spirit’ fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who will take soda, or juice they can keep the whole box, and it will give it free coffee only for a bar.
It will keep the water away.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but passengers complained seven months later they left behind and followed after any other major airline was there.
Frontier's passengers if they don't buy directly from the airline then this step of Frontier to charge charges on the Carry-On is their newest effort to operate customers towards their own website.
Airlines Online Travel Seller pays Orbitz $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That’s why all airlines have been encouraged to drive passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone forward in this area.
In September many frequently flight miles began to give half to those customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday it decreased the Mileage Award to 25 percent of the Trip Mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a 250-mile distance.
It also allows the only passengers to choose their seats in advance when purchasing directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier’s Denver has a loyal customer base in its home city, but its trade is getting less and it is losing money.
Income decreased by 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to corporate parent Republican Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday released financial results.
Republican airlines are trying to resolve the financing of Frontier as part of the sale.
NSA accused hackers of “internal error” instead of having a website crash
The Secret National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was closed for a few hours due to some technical shortcomings, not due to hackers as some people claimed online.
The intelligence agency said in a statement sent by e-mail, “NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight, which was due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-defined update.”
This problem will be resolved tonight.
This claim is not true that this barrier, the service’s distributed denial [D.D.O.S.] was caused by the attack.
On the evening, the online server tracker found that the NSA’s website was closed for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still unavailable.
A spokesman for NSA told A.B.C. News that there was no "compromises" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesman said no classified information is in danger.
At least one hacker group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the NSA’s website by the D.D.O.S. attack.
The D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large amount until the site is closed due to the surload of the server.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrealised and the aim of attacks is not to distract the internal network of the target system.
The previously extremely mysterious NSA, which has never been named “no such agency”, has become the subject of discussion and cut criticism among the general public by the appearance of events of a very large amount of foreign and domestic spyware programs in the past months - which has been collectively disrupted by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden after the secret NSA files were stolen from the agency and the mystery theory.
Due to this growing dispute about the agency, such speculations were made after the night incident that, this incident was the result of targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the "Another Dronational" narrative showing harmony in the Dwarf Age and the present circumstances.
It has been shown in what perspective today a master is bound to walk on the wrong path by binding in the fleets.
The opening of the drama was made by the main guest in the Sभागar of St. Joseph Inter College, the Legislative Governor Valmici, the Deputy Chairman of the Shivani Council, Shipra Rostogi, Naresh Consul and Power Singh jointly.
The drama was reflected in the dramatic and current circumstances of a professor Arvind.
In Anil Sharma directed drama, India भूषण Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechan, Hemant Goyl, Limite Summer, Vanshir Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, etc. gave a fantastic presentation making full justice with the characters.
Lighting in the drama was made by the young colormaker Jitendra C. Raj and set design by Hemant Kumar.
In its suburban ceremony, various awards were awarded to literary, cultural contributions from the part of Apta.
It was given to the Urdu department chairman of the phase Singh Vivi, Dr. Assalam Jamshedpuri, senior journalist Shanghuanat Shukla and colormaker Jitendra C. Raj.
In making the organization successful, the secretary सुरेंद्र Sharma, Rakesh Kaušik, Abid Rizvi, etc. contributed to the committees of the execution.
Reduction in the profits of Bombardier as aircraft delivery, decrease in orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. a 15 percent decline in net profits on Thursday, in the third quarter of its railway unit and under pressure by aircraft order and delivery on contractual issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not presented an update on issues that will release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or complete its ambitious program of going to commercial service from next September.
About a month and a half before the first flight of the test aircraft, it has only been flighted three times, questioning whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell lower than the forecast and shares were sent to sliding more than 8 percent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameroon Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, dropped its rating from "mat" to "regional performance" on Thursday, the stock is up during the next one or two quarters is limited.
"The weak aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a customer note.
We will receive a new order for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, there is doubt that the market program will be scared.
Bombardier hopes aircraft family can now cut it at the lower end of the dominant market of Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flighted for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight test to validate the company’s claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as a certain order for CSeries is up to 177.
403 full order and commitment is available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodone believed Bombardier will meet its 300 firm order target from the time of introducing the first jet to commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was running according to the schedule.
"Test aircraft stayed on the ground longer than predicted," Budwin said in a conference call, adding it also was determined during the interval of land testing and software update aircraft.
Each manufacturer makes schedules in a different way.
We have decided to take a first flight and a update period and said what we have done.
This is why the flight program will all be through.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following short time later, the company said
However, analysts believe that customers are suspicious of starting a CSeries aircraft operation after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier said this entry service (EIS) schedule was evaluated and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow speed of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our idea that the service in the entry will be pushed in Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended on 30 September, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
Per share adjusted income remained unchanged at 9 cent.
Revenue dropped from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion small.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 per share cent and $4.56 billion in revenue were expected.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that a year ago under 57, 45 aircraft were supplied during the quarter.
Clean order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The background in the Aerospace Division was $32.9 billion on September 30, no change since December 31.
"Airspace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the consumption of the following order and the overall market situation were a disappointment," Boudone said.
Airspace revenue decreases by 13 percent in $2 billion.
Bombardier said the world's largest train manufacturer, the division's revenue increased by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order in the transport unit was back-to-date of $32.6 billion of about 30 September, up to a moderate 31 December.
In the margin of the transport section, some major contracts were also influenced by the issues of execution.
Executive officials said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
In Bombardier’s shares, with Google Inc’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichet’s announcement of joining the Board, on Thursday’s mid-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle-middle.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, a 10-percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
You don’t think of anyone and you don’t think of stealing or deceiving.
But after the evening, our minds change and we begin to walk against the rule that puts the ideal on one side.
Researchers in this research from Harvard University and the David Excel School of Business of Uto have given many interesting facts.
According to the researchers, without the stress of work in the morning, we give pleasure to the moral values, but when evening is, honesty decreases due to fatigue or more pressure.
For this purpose, the researchers used two.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
As a matter of fact, people had to say that the point is more on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they answered wrong instead of the right answer, they would be given money.
This experiment found that those who were tested between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and gave the right answer.
At the same time, when using people between 12 and 6 p.m., it was found that they deliberately answered wrongly by putting their oncles on the tail.
Thus, the researchers managed to prove that in the morning the desire for money doesn’t matter about our honesty, but in the evening we stop giving the morality to mind.
This research has been published in the latest point of Psychological Science.

Mr. Big is arrested by Coke's adictive lawyer who gives secret information about police investigation
The 42-year-old Dita was informing the famous criminal Neil Scarborough.
The advocate thought people might know about his confidential drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The supreme lawyer of the defense party, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid, will be known to people about his secret drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
After 42-year-old Barash Dita made a deal on his cocaine addiction, the famous criminal Neil Scarborough provided sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities investigation.
This advocate, who was named "Bash" and whose criminals were praised as "top brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he had represented in the previous Narcotic Trial.
Officials saw Scarborough, 32 years old, holding three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for a Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After the investigation found Dita's hair, her wallets, and cocaine particles in her credit card, it was found that Dita was a "regular user" of drugs of category A.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, she tried to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two persons on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
As part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercedes, Berkshire and West Yorkshire, all four suspects were being monitored by police at the time.
There were 32 other people who were sent to prison during several impressions by the police after heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash were captured.
The 42-year-old Detta was informing the criminals, because she was afraid that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Situation in Blackburn Law Firm Forbes Soliciters worked in Dita, Liverpool Crown Court lasted three weeks after trial after being found guilty in two cases of interrupting the path of justice today Liverpool Crown Court was facing failure.
He had accepted about holding cocaine in the previous hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began when the police, while investigating Scarborough, found that he was in regular telephone contact with Detta since February 2011.
Two spies followed the suspect and saw him coming into the house of Detta and holding drugs with more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's ben in the Black Golf Glov.
After the drug was kept, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Detta, who went out for dinner at the Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, he found that there was a drug and nine times between them was communicated.
In court hearing that when Dita's hair, wallets and credit cards found signs of A-category drug, he was found a "regular user" of cocaine in the test.
Detta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and said his discussions were subject to "legal privileges".
During his arrest, Detta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by removing her wallet, but they were captured, and her hair samples were taken.
In a police interview, she said she was running office from her workplace as well as from her home, and her clients called her home for legal matters.
After the main persons arrested told what the spies knew about them, the court hearing said that Detta was calling the leading people of the drug supply chain, some of whom the case of people he had previously submitted.
On behalf of the prosecutor, Anne White said: "The criminal lawyer should know the best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Detta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate, having too much connection with his specific client.
We’re not talking about the relationship of the general drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing the drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations will be lawful without any doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went somewhere beyond the limits of the lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Detta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He made a lot of close proximity to a certain client, especially to Scarborough, and he allowed a deal with his freedom.
Dita denied any misconduct and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would work it immediately."
But after the hearing, Lancashire police superintendent Lee Halsted said: "At the time Mr. Dita began receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he turned himself from a criminal advocate to a criminal."
Due to his cocaine addiction he made excessive compromise and became much weaker towards the goals of the leading members of organized criminal groups, who used it to obtain important information related to police investigation.
Defenders should maintain the highest standard of authenticity, and have faith and confidence in people.
Mr. Dita has deceived with this belief and has tried to escape his profession.
Lancashire’s serious and organized criminal unit has investigated Mr. Dita, who has also been found guilty of three incidents of holding cocaine and now interfering with justice, which shows our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
This case should work as a warning to criminals that no person is far from access to the law.
We will find you out and present you to the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy for suppliing heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Fifty other members of the gang were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug crimes.
On her website, Detta gave questions and answers about herself, in which she said that her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in the United States, Muhammad Ali's dinner guest and inequality to be an inspiration for his work.
Kenya's press angry on controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying, "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: what is to prevent the parliament from stealing the freedom of justice tomorrow?"
Capital Group - which is the operating company of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM., Managing Director Cyrus Kamu said that "this law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said the new media jurisdiction "will always be partial, because it is the only part of the government" and said that the ban on themes and advertising will damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to send the MP people back by rejecting this bill.”
According to the newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with "strict control over the media", while the standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had "toughly hit" and called the bill cruel.
This bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the Islamic gunman attacked the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenya’s media had broadcast the security camera footage of the diarrhoods sent to the attack site, showing them stealing the mall in a subjective way, causing the officials to be angry with Kenya’s media.
Police chief David Kimayo had sent the sum for interrogation to two journalists and media workers, although the sum was taken back after the media had hacked.
Under the new bill, 2 million Kenyan shilling and different journalists on media companies may be penalized on ten million Kenyan shilling and, in addition to it, the additional risk of "treating out of the list" or not giving official press recognition will remain different.
If the penalty is not paid, the court also has the right to confiscate the property of the infringer.
According to Daily Nation, “a single economy is sufficient to shake the foundation of most FM stations.”
It also said that these measures could have the devastating effect described as the "live blogosphere" of Kenya.
By closing the mouth of the media, politicians know that they can do their own beliefs.
National journalist Mutuma Matthew Kenai writes describing the media as the main source of control and balance in public life "no one will never even know."
He wrote, “When the politicians are left, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the hunting and deposited era.”
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers had to face people's anger.
In May, he was not in favor of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission, and had restored approximately 532,000 shilling patterns, tax-free wages, which is considered one of the highest in the world.

The subject of Mozambique's safety concerns strong personalities grow as collision
With a statue of the Mozambique founder President Samora, who was looking down on them, thousands of people gathered in the central Maputo for a rare public exhibition for peace.
“We want peace back, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, Chief Executive Officer of an investment company.

The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo for two weeks has been almost daily since a peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Ray Namo was once a famous rebellion of the movement backed by the white ruled Rhodesia and the South African Colorful Government as part of the efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to the fully developed conflict, but recent events have caught foreign investors and local people.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy that finds the enormous offshore gas reserves and coal reserves in the northwest and some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Wales, Brazil, Eni could bring from the investment of more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the leading political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for tension.
Ray Namo says that the government started the latest struggle by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Ray Namo Gardens, on October 17th.
Attack on former rebels and then increasing government forces attacked the Renmo bases and told the Financial Times of the attempt to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the leader of the group, Fernando Meyang, the spokesman of Ray Namo.
The government accuses Ray Namo of triggering the confrontation, accusing the soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Gibuzhan has called for concerns about instability.
Mr. Gibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "hare" form "whatever his armies have continued to try to prove that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Frey Limo and Ray Namo both emphasize that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Meyang was quoted as saying that Ray Namo was abolished by the 1992 peace agreement but later again became a matter of concern.
He told FT meaning that the agreement is not being honored by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back to the negotiation, but seriously,” Mr. Myangne said.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing special to reduce the tension of a series of this year’s conflict.
“There are two great men fighting together (Gibuzhan and Dhakama) about them,” said Joseph Han, a lecturer and Mozambique expert at the London Open University.
They are not good talks, and they are not necessary to make the kind of benefits.
Ray Namo, who emphasizes the election reforms, has already said about the exclusion of the city corporate elections that will take place in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an effort of a patient movement to win the government’s benefits and economic robbery.
Ray Namo’s participation in voting has decreased since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in elections.
Mr. Meyang Mr. Gibuzhanko says - who are leaving the post on the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want to leave the nationality because he doesn’t want peace, he doesn’t want transparent elections,” Mr. Meyang said.
What kind of capacity Ray Namo has not been clear, but it is a major North South Highway on police stations and vehicles of disturbing hit and run tour he has done.
Most of the struggles are in the province of La Sophia, a few hundred kilometers north of Joamputo, where the host is the Beira Port that relies on the mining, coal exports, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
After threatening to attack the Ray Namo line in June, Rio suspended its experiment for a week.
Ray Namo was asked about whether or not this danger would be duplicated.
Ray Namo "Things didn't go well in Mozambique who wanted to make the international community aware, Mr. Meyang said.
The government of instability has increased the curtains further, Fernando Lima, Media Cop, says,who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and recent floods of kidnapping.
“People are the people responsible for the country’s future to the government and the president, and think he should be one to find the solution to problems,” they say.
Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need durability.
“No one is concerned about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets,” he said.
Children should be taught "as a model for a way of the writer of life,"miths and legends.
Thore's stories could show"There is no struggle of subtle tricks in cruel strength," while economical legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths will also not be suitable to be taught in "exceptionally far away even wild and in some cases it will not be suitable to be taught in pornography and schools," Cross Lee Holland defended one of the age-suitable functions of "precautionary selection".
“I find it surprising, in the United States, myth and popularity are already part of the field of education,” he said.
I’m hunting it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called the writers and teachers “most-interpreting” and it is “a new turn” for children, along with the messages being “presented” in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Biowulf from Anglo Saxon, together with writing the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk stories, said: "Your intentions may be many but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Probably an adult writer writing for a saint and an adult writer writing for an adult is a big difference that requires some meanings of hope.
Everything is to be simplified or come to a pleasant end, because but it is an intuitive sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than said to be revealed through a story.
It does not show the old foundation.

Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New York
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in the United States: a hundred years ago, the comedy dramatist Frank Fe, who served as the master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to hear jokes directly by way of conversation to the crowds sitting.
Fe's discovery has been extended over the years, most recently, in the New York Comedy Festival.
This festival, created and operated by Caroline Hirsh, the founder of the Caroline Standup Institute, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, including more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theaters.
Hirsh says, "Most of these headlines appeared in the Caroline, and became a great success, to a level where they became too big to be played in the club."
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s program includes the presence of Vanda Six, Katy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees in the Madison Square Garden, “Stand Up for Heroes” which included other artists including Bruce Springsteen, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
With the celebration being expanded, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year’s celebration have come from non-traditional media, such as show coming on small networks such as Comedy Central, F.X. and Spike.
Nick Croll arrived at the main spot from Deep-Cable Sitcom (the "The League" with the famous Ranchi Fantasy-Football theme of F.X.X.) and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Park and Recreation", although they are best known for their viral video series "Marsel de Shell With Shus On".
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate (Anthony Jesselinic with different disappointing voices, W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W.
One of the most important attractions of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg's Talk to Larry David:
Steinberg had begun to work as a stand-up comedian, but they have become named television and film director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show entitled "Sit Down Comedy With David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will be in the center of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
Steinberg said, “The city is in the comedy DNA of all Larry’s works.”
They told me that, when they were here, sometimes they went to the street between two buildings and thought in themselves that if I ever lost my whole money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall towards $96 per barrel
The oil price continues to decline on Friday, a report showing concern about more supplies is offset where the power hungry construction sector in China is becoming stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was down at $96.24 per barrel at late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the American raw New York Mercantile Exchange at 14 cents.
The contract has fallen 5.8 percent down for the month of October, falling 39 cent on Thursday.
The sufficient supply of raw oil has risen on the price in recent weeks.
Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand in the IJFA activity revealed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came on Friday.
This shows that developments could continue to strengthen China’s economic reform after being lowered by 7.8 percent in the last quarter in a two decades to the third quarter.
Brent crude is also a benchmark for international raw oil used by U.S. refineries, falling from $108.58 per barrel to 26 cents on the ICE exchange in London.
The court has blocked the action on the New York Police Department’s break and crude policy.
On Thursday, a federal appeal court blocked the changes that requires a judge's order for the New York Police Department's break and Crida program and removed the judge from the case.
The judge of the U.S. Circuit CourtApple 2nd, Shira Shindeller, said that the judge's judgment results will be delayed by the city on the result of an appeal.
The judge in the city was sentenced in August to violate the Constitution as it stopped people and excluded them from their program of interrogation.
The city police department also includes the decision to assign a monitoring to help change its policy and related training program, its conclusions and its therapeutic order appealed.
The Court of Appeal heard the requests on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that since he agreed to a judge to avoid the presence of party in part of a series of media interviews and the public differs from the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges so the judge should be removed from the case, the statements should be publicly responded to criticize the court.
The judge said the judgment was that police officers mistakenly violated the civilian rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its interruption and Crida program.
She has appointed an external monitor for supervision of major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and surveillance, and she has ordered a pilot program for testing body-wrapped cameras in some premises where it is most closed.
In August, New York City agreed to terminate the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were rejected after a police stop.
A oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The break and creed tips have been criticized with the advocates of civil rights.
The cessation and crossing policy has been somehow around decades, but most black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to 2011 all the time high to dramatically prevents growth under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A trial was submitted by four men by all minorities in 2004 and became a class action case.
The advocates of NYPD’s break and change in the Crida program have said that unfair behavior will end with a more reliable and effective police force and could affect the use of other police department’s policies.
Opponents say the change will reduce the police's mindset, but will solve a widespread problem of a police force under the pressure of crimes, money wasted and not cut by thousands of officials during the last decade.
The judge has noted that there was no termination for a break and a break, which is constitutional, but has improved the implementation of NYPD’s stop.

Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
News of the World’s former editor, Andy Colson, has been accused of using “phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face” in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his systemic relations while he was Charles Clark’s Secretary of State.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis Q.C. told Old Bale that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark is meeting his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper appointed the private investigator Glen Mulker to hack Paulby’s Voice and “bear the watch” of that man, but Colson also called and left his Voice.
Mr. Edis said, “The outreach party suggests that Mr. Colson who is now the editor of the N.O.T.W. is not known to stand out of the people’s house and watch them, but to keep articles in front of the people, to see what people react to it.”
N.O.T.W.U. has used three methods to investigate cases: telephone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
The third group included the editor himself.
He knew the other way of observation, he knew it.
What about the first?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, “yes, he knew exactly.”
The rumors about Clark's systemic relationships were first presented by A.O.T.W.'s feature desk at the time when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
In August 2006 from the house from Mullkeer, Mrs. Polby's phone was captured at least three times.
Investigators also found such entries in the private investigator's computer, on which Mrs. Polby and her sister were named "Project".
During the time they were being investigated, the grandmother of Mrs. Paulby was asked for information about them by calling anonymously.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlebek and former reporter James Weatherup watched Mrs. Polly’s arrival and departure.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him through a voice call, "I got a story that we are planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely want to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis said that Colson’s involvement in this case is in the parent with other important persons, such as former domestic secretary David Blanket.
The court heard on Thursday that Colson talked with Mr. Blanket about the systemic relationships with a married woman, while at that time he was looking at the case of co-representative Rebecca Brooks who was married at that time.
Colson and Brooks refused to interact with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulker, Thurlebek and Weatherup have accepted the phone hacking.
Increase corporate fear from the revelations of the NSA about state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter crashed at the U.S. Trade Embassy in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the mission of the German domestic intelligence agency was to take a picture of the roof of the U.S. square, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media called on BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the leasing antenna and pointed out an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the United States and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, emphasized that the U.S. would not use its foreign intelligence capabilities in September "to steal foreign companies' business secrets and increase U.S. companies' international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who makes Whisblowers, began to tell the American supervision of his secret treasures, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director will not follow his promise.
The U.S. National Security Agency spy on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo, expressed fear of royal surveillance.
The last thing came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Markle's phone was buged, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, then the leaders of the business world are also potential targets.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be practical that these data would be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany should be awake,” says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represent small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies Consultancy, the U.S. has almost now become a big risk as China, when it comes to industrial spy and theft of data.
All the documents are leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence that the United States has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of the European Union’s internet capabilities and it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
The business world leaders are doubtful about this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
Hasso Platner, chairman of the German business software company SAP, said “this is no way.”
If a strong European IT industry wanted it, then it would not be allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is rented, from coal to car, to farmers.
But IT industry is everything.
The discoveries exposed by Snowden about U.S. technical perfection and spyware access have proved to be a trauma for some companies who previously believed the biggest surveillance threat are China.
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing shell where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the United States is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, some 10 percent of non-American members canceled their plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the Data Prism Mining Program.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP says: “We saw a new question that did not come to customers a year ago – that is – my data said is stored? and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are confirming just what they’ve already known: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and for this they should be overwhelmed at every price.
That economic spy is not a surprise.
It has always happened.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemistry manufacturer BASF.
The U.S. is spying on us on a commercial and industrial level and we also do because it is in national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defence system and it is a benefit for the attacker.
For big companies, messaging is recording for a long time whether home-to-home business is uncomprehensible to leave with usb stick, or a laptop is uncomprehensible to leave in a hotel room at least to say.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of the automotive manufacturer Audi, says that it is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because their use could not be as remote hearing devices.
Germany’s BfV Executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile when the smart phones are compromised due to risk on foreign trips.
Prepaid mobile phones were thrown back later.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it has many companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack of experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned other countries about the economic spy of its own companies.
According to the French The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. National Intelligence in February was named in a second line of criminals involved in hacking for economic information that is behind Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic spy, "French is the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former chief of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: “Services know well that all countries, even if they participate in non-terrorist struggle, spy on their allies.”
The U.S. is spying on us on a commercial and industrial level and we also do because it is in national interest to defend our business.
No one is foolish.
Georgian teenage parents believed their son was killed
A Georgian teenager whose dead body was found covered in a restaurant mat in his high school gym, believes his son was murdered, the family advocate said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, G.A. was found stuck in a mat that stood straight behind the blitchers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators from the London County Sheriff concluded that Johnson was dead in a ‘unusual accident’, but the 17-year-old’s family denied it.
The advocate of Keneth and Jacqueline Johnson, Benjamin Krump, told Fox News Dotcom that “they fully believe that their son has been murdered.”
He has no confidence in the death as Sheriff said.
Crump said, “They believe that this is beyond the physical rule and the logic of ordinary intelligence.”
They think this conclusion is an excuse for the protection of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
He said, “He had sent his son to school with a bookback, and he returned to a body bag.”
U.S. spokesman Michael Ascare said on Thursday that he is doing a formal investigation about Johnson's death, taking into account that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder caused by a crime?
Murray said this in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever they are.
My goal is to bring the truth forward.
He said, “My opinion is that environmental causes exist for a formal investigation.”
Murray told reporters that the body tests showed that Johnson's death was a result of "static respiratory disorder".
According to Moore, a second body test found a different cause of death."
“There are so many questions that need to be answered or confirmed.”
Murray also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to identify a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or to investigate civil rights, he will ask the FBI to do so.
The representative was not immediately available for comments from the London County Sheriff office when contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge in South Georgia ordered the authorities to release all the surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video will find some signs of how he died.
C.D.C. has issued allergy-related guidelines for schools for children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies for children in school.
The U.S. government has for the first time issued such guidelines, as the number of children going to school suffers from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in every 20 children in the U.S. has food allergies.
C.D.C. found that cases of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
This guideline informs schools about how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies in children, and how to deal with them in case there is an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep stocks of apenefrin to face potentially fatal intensity (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the apene brand that is most commonly used.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to keep stocks of apenefrin in greater amounts easily.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, “It feels like something is swallowing in my tongue,” “It feels like my tongue has hair,” or “It feels like my tongue is swallowing.”
Intersex Kids Parents Can Choose ‘Gender Undefined’ Of Their Children
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize the third sex for children born with unclean genitality.
Now the newborn children will not be specified male or female in a conservative way.
The new law does not require parents to declare gender to such children, this law allows them to declare gender ‘unidentified’ or ‘unidentified’ on the child’s birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who may urgently make decisions related to gender identification surgery for newborn children, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.B.C., an intersex man said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will continue to make the wound, spotted pads made by doctors.
According to estimates, one in 2,000 children per year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of approximately 60 conditions, which falls under the examination of sexual development disorders, this is a collective term that is used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovarian or ovarian), or abnormally developed sex.
It is possible that Valice Simpson is intersex.
Gender identification is not yet correctly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to determine gender when gender determination cannot be made and to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before surgery, if such a occurrence occurs.
Psychologist Dr. Jack Dresher from New York City who is an expert in gender-identification matters, said the new law of Germany "parents good thing."
Intersex children create moral imbalances.
He said, “Some people are in a life-crisis situation that requires surgery, but that’s not the case with most children.”
You can only prescribe sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a penis will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer reasonably why this is happening.
This is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In a report submitted to the European Commission in 2011, intersex people have been described differently than transgender or transgender people, because their status is not related to gender but related to its biological composition, which is not clearly male or female but is either the combination of both or no one of the two is clearly defined.
These characteristics may show themselves secondary sexual aspects, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual aspects such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
This report provides overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of employment, as well as of persecution, violence and offensive crimes.
Now there are special camps for non-compatible sex boys.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark men, women or "third-sex" on their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Norry Me-Welby became the world's first recognized "sexless" person after winning a legal appeal for lifelong "unidentified" gender status.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the German passport, in addition to M or F, Intersex individuals will also have a third specification as X.
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues in neighboring countries in France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to withdraw "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed this German law, saying, “While the world is going into a state where gender is self-selected option, but not sexual activity, we are taking the other two columns of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of a newborn baby in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would like to see the children being given gender at the time of birth.
He said on the website about education, "Education without additional limits is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female generations were called Hermafrodites (Ubielings), which was named after the beautiful Greek god who was twilings.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the penis as a slate that could be removed and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they understand that gender recognition is a complicated task, and sometimes it may be a mistake from doctors who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Dresser says, “In the mid-20th century, it was called a ‘psychological emergency’.
When these children were born, you didn’t call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory on the treatment of children with obscure genitals was presented by Dr. John Money from John Hopkins University, who considered the gender constructive.
He created the term "gender identification" and argued that social and environmental signs - how parents raise the child - determine by interacting with the child's genes and hormones whether to be recognized as a man or as a woman.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/John", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis was crashed during the LINGAGRACHERM-UCHEDEN (SERKOMSION) to give his ovaries out by binding the child completely and make it like a lawn-palan girl.
Dresser said, "Money presented that case as a successful case of the transition, but it didn't happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned himself back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still "following the same form".
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after the 1990s, individuals who passed through this gender surgery began to appear "not happy with the result".
The same case was with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with X.Y. male chromosomes, but his genitality was unclean.
The doctors did not clearly understand that her penis was small, or that her puppy was big, but they were sure that she could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So, just a while after her birth in 1976, the outer organs and ovaries of Bruce were removed by surgery and her adulthood became like a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, “I knew I was not a girl.”
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, she was going to be vaginoplasty with her.
But feeling depressed and some disturbance, she asked for medical records.
He discovered the terrible truth.
When I was born I was bound - and no one told me ever.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented her body from producing sufficient amounts of testosterone, causing her genes not to develop properly.
After knowing the truth, she became a man back, she took a testosterone supplement and removed her breasts.
As a result of medical treatment, he was dismissed.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to generalize their perception.
But, California-based Legislative Group Advocates for Informed Choice’s Executive Director Annie Tamer-Matis expresses concern that Germany’s law “invites to cheep and crack.”
They say, "Many activists think that the law in Germany will encourage parents to make quick decisions and designate the child "undefined".
We are afraid that this will encourage the intervention.
We think that rather than waiting, determining male or female sex is a better process.
But we don’t know how the law will play its role, so we can only predict.
Tamer-Matis said his organization supports Australian law because "this allows adults to be identified in the third sex."
He said, “Adults about legal gender should be able to make their own decisions.”
The law of Germany relates to specify the time of birth.
This is not a struggle to be fought by newborn children at this time.
When growing up, decisions related to your body they can make themselves.
But Pittsburgh’s breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany’s law would “power both parents and children.”
Baratzi's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a full androgen insensitivity symptom called D.S.D.
Since her androgen grey had a defect, the female reflection in Katy developed.
His body is vaginal but there is no uterus or digestive.
She is now 29 years old and married and resident at the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is indifferent, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gastrointestinal sarogesis.
Baratz said, "This law allows parents not to make any decisions by themselves in a hurry."
It gives them reasonable understanding and time by some tests before writing ‘man’ or ‘woman’.
In this way, you are well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a nice child and enjoy it.
We don’t need to make such surgery in a hurry that cannot be returned.
He said, “It brings children into the decision-making process and releases parents from the impaired illness because they don’t believe they’re going well.”
Finally, the child will determine which sex he is more comfortable with — and that will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was held in Ramnagar's Middle School in Ramnagar in the presidency of the chairman of the committee and Ramnagar's all judges Sadip Kur.
Students and other persons were given the right to education and the law for those economically behind.
In the camp, Advocate ML Gupta, Rohin Indudvaz, and Sirpunch made people aware of the above-mentioned topic.
A large number of people were present in the program.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton on the place of Biden as Vice-President for the 2012 ticket.
The most remarkable explosion in the discovery is the heavy anticipated 2012 campaign Tom by Mark Halperin and John Heleman, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and told Thursday evening that the president’s top advisors held “wide group-sessions and polling in late 2011” to know what Dumping Biden could help in the falling expectation of Obama’s re-election.
According to the Times National political reporter Jonathan Martin, the book explains the full information of the main officials’ efforts in the campaign and the White House, for the name of the former White House staff’s main bill, to find out what the impact of the ex-state secretary Clinton’s change from the vice president on the poll.
Possible switch was a very secure secret inside the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval office.
Only half a dozen presidential close advisors – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisors David Axlarod and David Paluffé – were under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal match before finally making a decision when his information was telling that Clinton's ticket will not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's replacement with Biden.
"I said watching the whole scene, and one of them, that was," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember that at the time the presidency was in danger, so we were in such a position, "Saint Christ, what else will we do?"
While Dale described the research as "precautionary", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign invested significantly in finding how much this claim will benefit when polling.
“The campaign does not spend on voting and concentrated groups like money unless they are seriously considering something,” Martin said on AC360.
It’s unclear, however, what Obama knew that his team is looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale whether his boss knew about a possible change?
While Dale said they “do not think the president knew about the potential change,” the former Chief of Staff said it was “possible” that Obama knew it.
"Double Down" is certain: will not answer what political investigation came to Obama's desk?
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know about the dumping ticket research.
“Maybe,” Martin said.
Do you like dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-dark ice cream - gelifish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of benefit from marine animals to develop the best breakfast.
This idea came to her after reading a research paper on gelifish and China’s convinced scientists used chemical brightness to re-light protein.
Ice cream, eating that will increase the pH level of protein by responding to the tongue and ice cream will shine.
Chris says that the ice cream is illuminated with reacting to the mouth’s heat, that is, the more you win, the more it is illuminated.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I.M. Delisius Ice Cream Company, said: "This is an incredible thing on the early days of production me will get about 2 grams of goods from £200."
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warm, protein pH levels will increase and ice cream will shine.
We’ve been testing for the past few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween because it gives a wonderful bright effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve made because the glow of gelifish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, iska taste is very good.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company, apne is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaves.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It’s naturally impossible because of ice crystals that make deformations above ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is a utility of a reversible property of gelifish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists
The whole market was shut down from customers in the Queen’s Garden Market.
Recently it was that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy pot.
This recently was in Vazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Pacific Vihar located in the Central Market.
Something like this was found to be seen in the Nizhny Novgorod, Ashok Vihar, and the Sarrafa shops of the Model Town.
They also bought gold and silver jewellery and coins.
This is why the outer ring roads are also placed in other markets.
However, those who went home from Afis had to spend hours in the gym to get home.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay silent late and play dress up to play for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I’ve become more than a man.
I didn’t sign up to give candy out of my apartment for the past two years and this year it won’t.
But the statistics tell me that I am a black sheep when Havovene comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans will actually spend $158 million on Halloween this time, $6.9 billion on clothes and decorations.
One thing I have always seen is the trends of Halloween.
According to NRF, the total cost of clothing from $6.9 billion is estimated to be $1.2 billion
This year, all are angry with sexless objects.
Women don’t have to be vegetarians, because they’re also sexy foods like Jesse’s pizza, hamburger and carrots.
For men I hope a lot of zombies,and thank you going to make our Instagram feeds for the changing space men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-in clothes will be Zombis, Batman, Luter and Witch.
I think there is no evil in tradition.
Last year we dressed the dog and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pets.
This is the disturbance of a lot of hotdog dogs.
When Candy comes, we don’t see around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Heathy Bars, Lollipop, Milk Dads, Twizlers and Clark Bar are around £600 million.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is a good news that 41 million tricks are taking part in our neighborhood.
But in fact we, and those who are laughing, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectors Association, one thing we won’t use during the Halloween CandyCorn, but it will also sell about 35 million pounds.
It’s about 9 billion Maca’s personal crowd.
This is a mystery. yet to solve
There is nothing more than the intelligent Halloween Ghosts.
They’re the best name, like “terror behind the wall (which is actually a prison), “chik-o-chik” and “House of Shock.”
In fact, according to the American power, Waha 1200 is officially approved Ghost House in the United States that generates 500 million reads. and the terrible good pictures your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you.
Finally, let’s talk about the clay.
Charlie Brown introduced the great cabbage when we were a child, and a jack-o-latten cartridge is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something we have done since we were small.
For us, it was "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" last year just started thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with these guards and not with them.
According to the U.S. Population Bureau, this year, Americans will spend about $106 million on cabbage.
Jack-O slowly mourning latten on his front porch probably from Illinois, which this year increased by 542 million pounds of potato.

The dream of trading in the Pattaya market located in the Transport Area was not realized.
Pattacha traders have been caught in the money after the order of the High Court.
Neither are they now able to trade in the temporary patch market created in the Ranjiet Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses for trade in the Transport Area.
The commission formed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared the temporary Pattaya Market located in Ranjit Avenue insecure during its tour.
Because there was no proper proceedings, the Deputy Commissioner of the Amritsar was also punished by a penalty of ten million rupees.
The High Court said in his order that the administrative officials of the Amritsar were gathered and flattered, saying that such administration was a work that until nine years did not solve a difficulty of the pattaya traders.
They are not available in the right place in the city.
After that, adequate security management tax patch traders were asked to issue licenses for business in the shipyard located market.
After this order, even though the patatacha traders were happy, but on their happiness the police turned water on Friday.
The police’s real license brunch team arrived in the Pattaya Market and sold the form by placing a counter there.
After that, the conditions that were told to them were impossible to complete in one day.
ACP East Gurov Garg, Incharge Unup Kumar of Assalha License Branch, SHAO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the Pataka Market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the proceedings made by the Pattacha traders.
Therefore, the patch traders were not licensed.
A day is left.
The trader is troubled.
They are looking forward to the losses.
In the words of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Angry Pattaya traders took a rough march from the shipyard to the Ranjiet Avenue on Friday night.
Police and Jila were against the administration.
After that, Ranjiet Avenue also closed the business in the temporary patch market.
In a mining, firefighters were called to rescue a lost pope on the axis of a crashing mountain 50 feet above the ground.
Cocker Spanish Ruby Escaped After Arriving in a Little Street Talk
He was seen by a dog walker caught in a mining three days later.
Firefighters dropped the front part of the rock down from the wire to save the dog from the mouth of death.
After Papi was somehow stuck on the axis of a crashing mountain 50 feet above the ground, he got a lucky life by calling firefighters.
The nine-month Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after arriving in a street collision on Sunday afternoon and spent 3 days alone on Wednesday before being saved from the mining.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denham, Ruby were in the Flippit mining in West Yorkshire to meet again, and he has thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After she fled after a small accident, she was searching for her lost dog as a crazy, and appeal was posted on social networks.
On Wednesday at 2.15 a.m., a sharp-looking Doc Walker saw Ruby, on the mountain in the mining at a height of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Clarkheaton fire station arrived at the scene and dropped down by the wire to save Ruby and used a stomach tube to bring him down from the rock.
Technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said, “He was in a crisis situation.
It was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He did not do a single move during the rescue, he was a stone.
But now he is good.
After that he was eating biscuit.
It was an unusual help call.
It is unbelievable to see the dog.
Special technical rescue officer Peter Law said "Ruby survived in a lucky way."
He was seriously injured and was likely to be in a worse situation.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where he was found good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said, “It was terrible to see the rescue work.”
I didn’t believe how he arrived there.
It is amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was too tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The firefighters did a great deal.
What he did is really a very courageous job.
We were their great, and they were all the best.
Mr. Alderson from Keagley also said, “We feared he could fall, but he stayed there.”
The firefighters did great work.
I couldn’t believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says that when Katie Perry was 18, she didn't attack her.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, Ponn Star said he had singed backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rockers, and “When I was 18, they attacked me.”
He said, “This thing has become old, and he’s treating me well.”
The representative of the 70-year-old Jagger said in a statement on Thursday that he “we expressly refuse to ever attack Katie Parry.”
The representative also said, "Perry is probably talking about them in another person's misunderstanding."
Parry was one of the singers coming as a guest on the Rolling Stone Tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top this week.
George Kerevan: Euro breakdown gave Scots a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
The passport control on Barwick and the walls of Hadrian indicate stories about the boundary of the cord.
The truth is that Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictedly - it was not described in the headlines.
No one has described that the EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Shengen region, so Brussels will have an affordable discount for sustainable non-compliance Brussels in return to obtaining whatever it really wants from Scotland.
And then, a story.
And the thing that is so long trapped, it is frozen. First I heard of the Babylonian news about 40 years ago, "Freedom means passport control."
Nevertheless, this interesting old story lost an interesting point to tell again.
Why should we expect Europe from independent Scotland anyway?
Why buy-sale London's yoc for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
In the whole of the EU, dedicated teams are getting stronger to oppose the EU or to close the euro as the same currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany party - which has been founded this year - suddenly arrived and obtained fifty million votes in the federal elections in September, and thus effectively removed the Free Democrats (equivalent to our Lib Demons) from the Bundestag.
The plan to build a federal Europe has always been domestic opposition.
But, the current economic crisis has proved a mutual factor.
As well as the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone far away because of the obstacles imposed on the national economies through the compliance with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not play much role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - that was true only in the case of Greece.
Instead, the euro system stabilized its members the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters – something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a position of intrinsic loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce wages and public spending – which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Current budget and currency problems are somewhere beyond deep European productivity.
To provide discount on consumer spending to French and German energy firms - as a result of the "destroyed" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice for electricity than the United Nations and four times for gas.
This is a cost loss that we have seen in Greengmouth.
Even if all wages in the world are frozen, the European petrochemical industry cannot be prevented from being affected by affordable U.S. shell gas.
As a result, the feeling of rebellion is triggering among people, especially in France, which was once the main fan of the EU.
After Judah, the top French politicians saw the EU as a means of keeping Germany under control, and providing Paris in the world equal billing to Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing France’s economy to go down.
Results: Marine Lee Pen's southern, anti-U.U. National Front has gained victory by pushing the ruling socialist to the third place in the recent subjugation.
At this time, the Front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes - this is a timely warning for the British Labour that they can’t go assuming that the disintegration to the left, the right will automatically benefit.
What does Lee Pen do with his new celebrity in the middle of the French blondes, working class?
This party wants to use the next year’s EU elections in the European Parliament to make an anti-EU, supreme anti-currency group.
If, as much as possible, the EU opposition parties perform well in these elections, this type of group could influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon the combination of anti-EU and anti-currency spirit in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not be completely ended, but it will come back in a form like "Europe of (Supreme) Nations" which will be supported by General De Gaulle.
Germany and some of its subsidiary economies may maintain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will reboot their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from this project in the hope of increasing its proximity with the U.S.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after that?
We can choose to stay in the area of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can defend our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland could perform better in the free European system, provided we keep our own position.
It will be easy for non-Federal nations to work together with other countries with the same thought in Europe.
Otherwise we should considerining our economic freedom while walking on the way to Norway.
The S.N.P. government in Scotland - remarkably - was the most successful anti-mity political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in the year 2011 on the basis of the proposed (this acting) cuts by Labour Chancellor Elister Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem Alliance.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, because in that situation it will have to accept the rules of citizenship imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Pre-Time Adolescence: Grow fast
Research shows that African-American and Spanish girls get puberty at a younger age than blond girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is close.
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemistry can be blamed.
Experts believe that stagnation eruption may be a cause of puberty in a young age
The case of early puberty is not as effective in boys.
C.N.N.'s former reporter Pat Ethereum is an expert journalist in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried, if her daughter starts breast growth and genital hair loss at the age of 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatric Medicine in Orlando, Florida this week, Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, these reflect new movements.
Caplowitz says, "I spend a lot of time insisting parents - that it generally doesn't reflect smoothly progress in the direction of full puberty."
Direct symptoms of development such as breast fertilization, genital and neck hair and physical smell are appearing early in girls.
But in the last four decades there has been a very small change in the age of Rajoidance (first monthly-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
"When the breast begins to grow, the first menopause takes at least two to three years," Caplowitz explains, who are also the authors of "pre-menopause in girls: the necessary guide to dealing with this common problem."
The most accurate testing of the development of the puberty is the time.
There is a debate about what the beginning of puberty is, but when breast growth is increased before the age of 8 years, two call it "haired-adult".
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - which can be closely monitored by the pediatrist.
In cases of more subtle progress, an endocrinologist may require examination in order to eliminate the possibilities of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay prematurely menstrual and other results: prematurely aging of the bones, which can cause undeveloped growth and narrowness as an adult.
Presentations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are conscious about drugs but admit, "pressing adolescence can increase behavioral problems, and girls may begin to feel different from their colleagues."
The second big problem can be understood: parents just don’t want their younger daughter to be menstrual.
Caplowitz said, "They are worried about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene."
A woman whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10, remembers, “It was a shock.”
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstrual religion, it was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned troubled that her first menstruation had begun in her heels.
There are a lot of common theories about the causes of an asymmetic puberty.
However, there is no permanent evidence that milk or other foods can be accused of hormones, chemicals in the environment or sexual-oriented messages in the media.
The boys - like the girls - are also getting early puberty.
Caplovites determine the rule that the main reason for it is the epidemic of stability.
He helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, which connects body fat with puberty time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls tend to get puberty before their age blond girls.
There is a lot of clarification about this.
On a global level, the shape of premature puberty, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be affected by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys face and genital hair are obtained in a young age, the full course of puberty is not as clear as girls in them.
Other doctors attending the A.A.P. conference supported the complications of the subject.
Even babies and children have become common to see acne and genital hair.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Gorayeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, says, "We need to be cautious about how we identify the real beginning of puberty."
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their pediatrist to get an opinion about how to talk to their children.
Caplowitz advised, "This may mean to negotiate before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Girls that advance the time need to be given this confidence that even if it is advance the time, it is part of normal life.
The temperature dropped 3.1 degrees Celsius on Friday.
The rain and cold weather on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Friday, people wore switches and went to the markets and their destination.
The first time the cold was raining, the people were also removed.
In the morning, people enjoy the sun.
Weather changing will also get a lot of relief from the disease, but after that the sunshine shadow continued to be silent.
The kids went to school with switches.
Meanwhile, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
7.8 mm of rain was recorded.
According to the weather department, clouds will remain on the sky.
Big orders of jet manufacturers from the dispute for seat width on the bet.
This month Dubai Arshou has seen a hole setting the rhythm for disputes among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-distance flights
The dispute is focused on the width of the seat of the Economy class in the aircraft of long flights, always as provided by the airlines not as but whose assigned location efficiency has claimed to be key by the latest jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus has hoped this week to give a wide seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the Economy Cabin, but it should be decided by Airlines, says its main rival Boeing.
The dispute between aircraft manufacturers comes when after the event of 17-21 the potential recorded order from the long-distance Ercraft’s twin engine has started to sell the big version.
How the previous department of the aircraft is built- especially whether the seating 9 or 10 is equal to the demand of more capacity, the design of the mini Jambo jet is being prepared?
Boeing says it has created "777 X" which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in one line in the single department.
Airbus says it will take 350 people with the A350 to 9 equal seats left 18 inches.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, the hopes to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arshou with Airbus 777 X, so further appeals to the public.
Recently it is being seen that the beginning of the victory war was anything this Fincero showing it together in a restaurant three together will you accept it?
Airbus sales chief John Lehy said, “Boeing is offering long-distance flights in shuttle seats even from the regional turbo.”
As a change, people are getting big, but the way the plane is sitting is not a reward.
According to the statistics of the U.S. Department of Health between the 1970s when Boeing 747 Jambo ne modern long-term ki travel ko defined tha, and the century ant me average 40-49-year-old U.S. male ke weight me increased by 10 percent.
According to the U.S. Health Statistics, the average U.S. man's leg in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rivals are attached to a seat concept of 1950 when the new name "Jet Set" was the average perimeter.
Airbus says it has established a research committee that suggests an additional inch in the seat width to improve the quality of 53 percent sleep.
Boeing disputed Airbus' seat measurement statistics, and said it doesn't depend on manufacturers' decisions on how airlines rental and facilities make balance.
According to it, the research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Crawler said, “It really shows airlines flexibility and the belief in what they need to do to succeed.”
“They don’t want to tell us what they benefit from.”
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers, it’s about the corner room, but for suppliers, it’s a problem that it can affect the income.
A trade estimate of at least $700 billion behind this dispute is enough for the competition of aircraft order to hit the gap of U.S. and European exports in the coming decades.
Reuters that for the first time in July,which seat layout is actually a matter of battle between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that they had 20 percent workforce per seat in their new twins engine design, the leader of that section, compared to 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Air.
Boeing’s performance claim depends on the 10’s 777 x One original 9’s 777 design.
The unit cost has now been used comparison of 10 equals with profit.
Kevin Kenniston, head of the European Airbus Passenger Facility says, “Boeing’s aircraft is doing it to capture more seats to make our products more competitive.”
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin suggests for the existing 777 S that many passengers are in favour of the dancer layout, which can also go with cheap rental.
Cabin Interior Specialist My Curby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network said: "The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of the proposal of 777"
Airbus and Boeing are not providing seats but are providing a list to choose from suppliers for airlines.
Jet sellers from all over the world should also carefully check this layout competition.
More relaxing, all builders are also providing low-cost aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus gives a 10 equal to the A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus has emphasized the wider cabin seats on some of its jet planes for the need for more cabin facilities.
Modern jet aircraft are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it can distort 777 X from the wave of sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Can Stop Smoking Enjoyment
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
It requires further and further tests before testing on humans begins, which may take many years, but Professor Ronald Crystal at the Will Cornell Medical College in New York said that arterial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, “We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their nicotine addiction is much more powerful than these existing methods.”
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which is designed to transmit genetic information with the purpose of creating an anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects the liver cell, which begins to create a permanent stream of antibodies after it.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent the rise of nicotine in the smoker by deactivating them before they reach the brain.
In the test, the vaccinated mice who were later given nicotine continued to perform their normal activity.
The researchers say that but the mouse who had not been vaccinated "he felt good," it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translation Medicine.
The first tobacco vaccine therefore failed, because they had antibodies.
It had to give doses on a regular interval, so that the antibodies level remained, but it proved expensive and unpraktikal.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be too much, as the liver cell will become an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine remained entirely safe, it could be given to children, before the desire to try cigarettes, which could protect them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will find out that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habits.
British scientists said the result was interesting, but warned of the need for too much research.
Even after the postmortem, the real cause of Babyn's death could not rise.
The Forest Department says the first sight of Babylon's death is natural.
On Thursday night, the forest staff of the Ramnagar forest department had a body of a Babylon near the PvLagar Conservation Reserve Tchadi Nale.
All the organs of the body of Babylon were safe and there were no traces of injury or injury on it.
On Friday, the Forest Conservative Awareness Panda, CTR's subdirector Sign Badola, DFO Talkshah Nasim, SDO GS Karki's presence was postmortem of the body of Babylon by CTR's veterinary therapist Plate and Kotabag's veterinary therapist Hema Rathur.
The sources believe that during the postmortem the terrorist body of Babylon is being bad.
It did not find out the real causes of Babyan's death.
At the death of Babylon, the department officials answered Golmal.
Nevertheless, the IVRI Barreli has been sent to the territory of Babylon for the topsychological examination to be held to confirm the poison.
Forest Protector West Worth Awareness Panda said the death of Babylon could be called natural.
There were no signs of poison from the body of Babylon.
However, the area around it is being searched as well as sends a bit of investigation to confirm the poison.
Tripody Obyde refuses to be affected by us.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by State Carpson Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to do the maritime paths that reject the policy at the request of his political guru Eddie Obid, former New South Wales protector Eddie Obid, whose government-controlled three geometry had hidden selfishness.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the investigation that,what Mr. Obid was from several state ministers for the violation of the circles of the policy of the Parvi's payments? where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obid, without tender was renewed in August 2005 after his time expiration.
After the evidence given on Thursday by former Deputy Chief of Staff, Lin Ashpole knows the hidden selfishness of Mr. Tripodi Mr. Obiid.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had given pressure to launch a public tender for stakes.
The pets were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the Circular Enterprises for Pattons, from which Obiid earned $2.5 million a year, were renewed from the tender of Pattons.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the minister of the Dergahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the public tender.
But he refused to change on Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tripodi had demanded a change in the government's pay policy.
A copy presented in a telephone call in ICAC in August and September 2007 Mr. Obid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Don, a senior official who came to Mr. Obid's Fisheries Department after Ports Ministry worked
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. " was the development of the commercial bond policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
“No,” Mr. Tripody replied.
I could not remember what was discussed, but it was not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obyde.
The officials say the Israeli fighter aircraft fled in Syria.
Israeli fighter aircraft targeted the Syrian port city Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.
The officer did not tell what the motivation was, but there was at least one motivation necessarily.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the RA-125 missile.
Israel has launched a missile attack on Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on the 457 visa can pass the "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on the 457 visa, as it aims to extend a rigorous procedure.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent the 457 that is used to fill in incompetent positions in Australia or to be delivered to family and friends in a pleasant way.
Today a government discussion letter was issued, condemning the government's vocabulary about foreign employees, former Labour M.P. Maxine McQue said today that it could crush the neighboring countries of Australia.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that “foreign people are arriving at the end of the line” and “Australian people work first” is a very unpleasant repeat at a time, while the unions have demanded a secure labour market.”
Historically, it focused on the fact that white workers should be safeguarded - and if some people in the area saw the reflection of that historical proof, I’t be surprised.
The discussion letter shows the framework of 12 measures, which were first considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he met with officials about the people who trafficked, has implemented five presented changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined on whether “the registration is true in circumstances in which the registered person, the owner of the visa sponsor or the corresponding person’s relative or personal partner is”.
Entrepreneurs may need to count the number of 457 visa holders, as the first entrepreneurs who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees put hundreds of people on the job.
During this time, a 35-year-old Sri Lanka asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's narrow nine-year-old son had arrived with him on a trip to Australia, and on Wednesday after his father's death, his adult uncle brother had binding the roofs, who were on the same boat.
Australian officials brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland’s profits from the HS2 rail project.
The work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Kramer said that the project "will become Britain one."
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said that working with the British government on this project is very "outsourced".
The first phase will include a new high-speed railway between London and West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government converted the cost of building high-speed links between London and North England to £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, instructed HS2 Limited to consider the possibilities to improve the rail capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Barones Cremer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be much higher.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be due to HS2 and well connected.
According to Scottish Secretary Elister Carmicle: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed from Mr. Carmicle to the "clear" return of Scotland to the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed rail is likely to have a huge economic benefit to Scotland, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole case of high-speed rail in Britain.
So we are excited to work in the British government’s partnership, so that we can explore options for bringing high-speed railways to Scotland, creating benefits for all and fulfilling the Glasgow-Adenburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to reviewing the investigation report with the ministers of the British government next year and making decisions together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will remain effective now in Australia
Despite the soft steps in the U.S. equipment-related regulations, Australian aircraft passengers will continue to shut off their tablets and smartphones while flying and landing the aircraft.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left open options to U.S. Aircraft Service companies to change their processes, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during the important phases of the flight, provided they stay in the "Aircraft" mode.
Passengers can still do this during a lot of flights, but many people don’t seem good to be unable to reach their e-book etc. when they fly and land.
Australian airline service companies are considering this decision, according to which US airline service companies will have to do too much to meet this requirement, but they have pointed out that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it is considering the announcement, but stressed that the ban on the use of electric equipment in the key phases of flight in Australia is still effective.
"At present, CASA has no specific regulations to control the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, "This issue falls under the regulations, according to which air service operating companies must ensure that the safety system is always fully preserved, and passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by members of the crew."
Virgin, who is already negotiating with CASA about extending its use of its in-light Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked for further action on the regulator's instructions.
The spokesman said, "We will welcome the review by CASA in the case of permission to use electric equipment, because we really think it will provide better experience to customers, because now we have (Wireless In-Flight Entertainment) in our aircraft.
Quantas said it will follow the current rules now.
He said, “According to our current policy, electric equipment cannot be used during flight and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change it.”
FAA decisions apply to U.S. Alerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will consider the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio transmission from mobile devices, as well as to modify their rules books, training materials, carri-on baggage programs and passengers in providing brief details.
The FAA said that "after the verification by airlines of their aircraft's durability it will allow passengers to use hands-on, lightweight electric equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights."
In viral cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to close their equipment during the landing of the aircraft.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safe under the seat or in the upper boxes during flight and landing.
Ponnbrokers' silver due to being felt difficult by the middle class in Singapore
Mr. Amirthalinga is taking cash by giving her gold shell, ring and shell to pay her daughter’s school fees.
Mrs. Amirathling said, “My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it.”
They say, although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars as administrators (2,400 US dollars), and their husband also works, the family’s monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, there is a similar demand in the parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is growing - the Valumex where they are doing their transactions, this week became the third ponchup to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Keeping the jewellery stuck is not the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Mrs. Amithalinga - but it is almost as cheap as a unsecure bank loan.
Generally, popbrokers in Singapore take 17 percent per year interest, which is slightly higher than 15.4 percent offered by the United Overcage Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, the brokers have the advantage of not being required to verify credit or pay proof, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are moving to a ponchoop due to the increasing costs of living by families and the difficulties due to the increase in domestic and consumer loans.
After a strong growth for five years after the global financial catastrophe, and after cheap credits due to simple monetary policies in developed economies, low and medium-income families are pushing to meet their needs due to their economy’s fall.
This week, the rating agency, Standard & Poor's, increasing domestic profits, mainly due to rising mortgages, a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It said that Asia has the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia is the highest in this list with 80 percent of GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer loans in Thailand, which has arisen slightly from the technological recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed constant export decline and consumer demand.
The economist SONG SING WUN at the Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B. said, “The decisive point is that, with rising prices, people who come from the middle to the lower will try to increase their income in every way possible.”
Historically high values in gold values in the past two years have motivated people to keep their personal assets stuck, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to pay the value of their family jewellery.
70 percent of the objects caught in the 200 Poon outlet of the City State in Singapore are gold.
People say, “The sound of the gold looks good, let’s keep the grandmother’s gold chain stuck, and take it back next month.”
Thailand’s largest ponshop operator, EGIMNI, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
The holding business has grown so much that Valumax and 15 other outlet operators like it in Singapore are planning to expand to Malaysia, not only in their neighborhoods, where it has four stores, but are planning to expand outside Asia, says Valumax’s executive director Yah Lee Ching.
The company will fund it, using 60 percent of 66 million Singapore dollars received in the listing this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders (loaners) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Mrs. Yah says that holding falls not only gets an affordable rate compared to other lenders, but it also does not directly increase the loan.
They say, "Clients hold the items they already have, and paying individual assets does not increase domestic debt.
The social acceptance of PONBROKING is increasing to obtain short-term and secure financial assistance.
It’s not that ponbrokers are used only by financially weak people.
The wealthy people in Singapore also use the Valumax outlet, they hold gold bars or Rolex clocks that can get a cash payment of up to 60 percent of their purchase value.
We have customers from all categories of society.
Mrs. Yah says, “These include wealthy people who need a loan for a short time for a business enterprise or investment, or small who need to meet their cash flow requirements.”
Sometimes they only need money in a very short time.
India's biggest businessman Mukesh Umbani that Wife Nita Umbani celebrates its 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
It is not in Mumbai but in Mumbai.
He organized a great party on this occasion.
Many big stars of Bollywood arrived in Jodhpur to celebrate this party.On the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen holding Jodhpur's flight at Mumbai Airport.

$325 million rescue package for Taji's health
The federal government has emphasized that strict conditions are also associated with a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s becoming sick health system that will ensure that the state government can’t waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plybersek has announced that the National Assembly, the island state’s aging population, the high rate of sicknesses, and the boundaries of the system are taking “extreme action” to solve the current crisis due to.
The decision of financing that was made during four years, was made after consultation by the government with the independent parliamentary Andrew Wilki of Tasmania.
Mrs. Plybersek said today, “The government has brought an emergency rescue package, about which we believe it will solve the special challenges faced by the state.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgery plan.
Additional 2600 operations, including ortopedic and pimples surgery, will help solve previously collected cases.
It also includes funds for the launch of a walk-in clinic in Hobart and Lonsestation, better care after leaving the hospital, training of medical specialists, mental health services and individual electronic health recording systems in local hospitals.
Mrs. Plybersek said, “These investments are in line with the best ways I’ve been told by leading physicians to improve the health system in Tasmania.”
The minister emphasized that the Tasmania government will face strict reporting and responsibility rule.
The state must maintain the current level of financing to obtain national funds, and report every month where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member committee will be formed to ensure that the service is provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the state.
Mr. Wilki said the value of $325 million will not be too high, "unless real improvements are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more tolerable level."
Nevertheless, they praised the government for reacting to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.”
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope that the federal aid package will prove very helpful in the direction of separating the state re public health system from the crisis list."
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes will primarily anticipate recent cuts.
But the federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “band-ed solution.”
He told A.B.C. TV, “We’re here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken $430 million into its health system.
You cannot consider taking about half a billion dollars by the state government and giving 300 million dollars by the National Assembly as a good news day.
Mr. Duten demanded that Mrs. Plybersek should guarantee that no one of the rescue packages will be spent on extra bureaucracy.
The novel of Denis Diderot has the best production design and time period in conversion by Gillum Niklux, but it has become much greater than it should have been.

When she is rebelling, she faces extreme cruelty in the hands of the volunteer mother suprier, and becomes the object of a sensual attraction for the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
Due to the strong gravity of the narrative, there is also a risk for the audience to become a boring film in it.

The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria has destroyed key equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while an agile conflict has emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where poisonous agents are believed to be placed.
On Thursday, the Syrian Movement group said that 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War which began three years ago.
This announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons took place a day before the last date of 1 November
The Hague-based organization had appointed Dumskus to destroy or "ineffective" all chemical weapons production units and the machinery used to mix chemicals in toxic gases and fill them in war materials.
Mainly to complete the initial phase of destruction, this ambitious event is a meaningful mile stone aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of the year 2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Dumskus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1,000 metric tons of chemistry and weapons, including master gas and nerve agent sirin.
The British State Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that the announcement occurred at the time the conflict increased in the city of Safira on Thursday, about which experts believe it is the chemical weapons production unit as well as the storage center.
The movement group, which contains details of the number of dead through the movement’s network in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have been killed.
He said 6,365 of them included 61,067 ordinary citizens, including children.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar al-Assad are members of the military, 18,678 are fighters in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah are aggressors.
It also said that among the dead there are 2,202 troops and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of which are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that about 100,000 people were killed in the conflict that is coming since March 2011.
It has not updated the figures since then.
Due to this conflict, about 20 million people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's troops were fighting rebels in Safirah for several weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said people from both sides were killed, but clearly said nothing.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing Civil War in a very short time limit.
In a statement to the O.P.C.W., working together with the United Nations, it said that its team is “just satisfied and it has confirmed – and has seen all the declared significant production and mixing/blowing equipment in Syria – as destroyed.”
He also said, “There is no further inspection activity being planned.”
At the beginning of this week, the inspectors said they have completed the first phase of the confirmation work by going to 21 of the 23 centers declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to go to two centers for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.W. said that according to Syria, these two centers have been “told and... the chemical weapons products placed there have been delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira, is one of those two centers, where the inspectors of O.P.C.W. were unable to go.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
In a comment published by O.P.C.W.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U.U
This three-year-old domestic war is mainly a struggle between the Assad government and its security forces, including members of the Shiite Islam, and rebellion Sunni Muslims.
In other events, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said a massive explosion occurred on Wednesday at the Air Defense Center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known.
Police have removed copies of the prison records, prison signs, laptops and prison records from the capture of the accused.
The City Police has recorded all the accusations.
Police Commissioner Permjit Singh Gill that the arrest accusations include the Rajiv Agraval of the city located in Habovel, the Bintou, the Kamal कृष्ण Jaswal, the Gurindar Singh Guggi and the Sonu of the city.
The Book of the Holy Spirit (the Book of the Holy Spirit) has been revealed.
According to the police, the accused registered with the Clark and recordkeeper of the office, Balbir Singh, together with the records of the empty and old lands, taking out the papers and then purchasing new stamp papers and preparing the jali registry on them.
It was not that after that the real record disappeared and the jelly record recorded.
After that, the accused sold the land in millions of rubles on paper.
There, they took the lone on the paper.
After that, the real owner of the land was pushed by the police and administration.
The prisoners who were preparing the registration were observing the land of the NRAIGI.
There is no one who will monitor the land of NRI.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the land records.
Police Commissioner Gil said the accused said in the questionnaire that he has prepared approximately 150 fake registers.
According to the police, there are previously cases of fraud and theft against the gang.
Crime on the conviction of a bomb explosion in Bali
Families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb explosion in 2002, angry on the sentence given to the conspirator of the bomb explosion, said Omar Patek should face the firearm.
Patek, who has been running as one of the most desirable individuals in Southeast Asia for 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
He may be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also convicted of many other terrorist charges, including a series of bomb explosions in a church in Indonesia in the early evening of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a lifetime imprisonment, although they could also demand that the master who made the bomb was the death penalty of this person, known as the unknown "destruction person".
This decision refreshed the painful memories of the woman living in Perth, June Curtin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in the devastating attack of Patek and her co-conspirates a decade ago.
Stoping his auditions, he said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have received the same punishment as other brutal terrorists.
Mrs. Curtin told A.A.P., "He should be standing in front of the firearms."
I have to live every day without my grandparents and my daughters.
After 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002, the name of the club was disappeared after the explosion of the bomb loaded in the van standing outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddle bar when a bag pack filled with explosive materials by suicide attackers exploded just 20 seconds before.
They went into a month-long coma as a result of the bomb explosion and three times "dead" during their stay on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment that had been received by three other members of the Islamic terrorist group responsible for this genocide - Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Sea - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before someone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and hurting countless people, 20 years of imprisonment is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be sentenced to death among the bomb explosives.
He escaped from being captured for a decade, but eventually in January 2011, he was arrested in Abt-Bad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military had killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had presented evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
Mrs. Curtin says, “She didn’t give up.”
Even to him today, so many people do not really suffer from mental suffering.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
Mrs. Curtin said, “This year there will be a lot of tears.”
Patek can still appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in aircraft (but cell phone cannot call)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to their cellphone - this is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a press conference, FAA administrator Michael Huarta said how quickly these changes are implemented, it will be different in each airline.
Airlines must indicate to the FAA how their aircraft, how they comply with the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for their crew members’ training books and equipment collection to indicate the guidelines.
The FAA said it has already obtained plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among those airlines who have already presented plans.
FAA said in a statement, “Based on the situation of the project, we can very quickly accept the extended use of electronic devices.
Currently, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the aircraft’s door is closed.
They are expected not to turn them up until they reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft lands, and do not turn off until the aircraft lands completely.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully secure from electronic disruptions may allow their passengers to use the device when flying by aircraft, when aircraft land and when taxiing.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher heights are expected to meet these criteria.
The chairman of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Laura Glading, welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines to do so - it will be a win for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we’re bored to feel like “Hall Monitors”.
But surfing by connecting to the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, email exchange, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, a game like the online scrabble, with which the famous event associated is that in 2011, when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying in the airport park, and when he was forbidden to close the device, American Airlines had pulled them off the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected because their rise will cause worries about the injury of another person in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory rights related to telephone calls are at the Federal Communications Commission, not at the FAA.
During the flight and landing of the aircraft, the FAA may remove the ban on some electronic devices.
Last month Mark Rosencan of the National Transport Safety Board who is C.B.S. News’s National Transport Safety Expert said that cell phones are still considered a risk.
Rosenker said, “Cell phones are really a serious problem, not only because they may potentially cause disorders in the navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disorders in the cell phones towers when they are in the air.
To investigate this issue, the industry world consulting committee formed by the FAA last month presented that the government should allow more use of individual electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to reduce the ban on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskilk, D-Mo have said there is no legitimate security reason for the prohibition.
Implementing these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is universal.
Some studies also indicate that a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began to ban the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when passengers had received reports of disruptions in navigation and communication equipment due to the transport of FM radio and high-tech gadgets at the time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved to be resistant to electronic interference by the FAA.
Airlines have been offering use of Wi-Fi on cruise heights from passengers for many years.
Modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
Hearta said that most airlines should rely on eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today’s electronic devices emit much less power radio transmission than the previous generation’s electronic devices.
For example, e-reader is a transmission of the exact nominal during the page turning.
But the transmission is predominant when the data is downloaded or sent by the device.
Amazon.com was also one of those who supported the reduction of the restrictions imposed by passengers on the use of the device.
In 2011, the company’s officials loaded their entire Kindle e-reader in the airline and flew it to test problems but no one found such a problem.
About the risks arising from the use of the device, the FAA Advisory Committee has expressed milious feelings.
Douglas Kid of the National Aviation Passenger Association said that he believes that the disruption from the device is real, whether the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of disruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members presented that the FAA would allow the pilot to order passengers to turn off the device when the aircraft landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and has provided them with the general knowledge of the people who travel in the latest phases of technology.
C.E.O. Roger Do of the U.S. Travel Association said we are glad that the FAA has recognized that traveling with pleasure is not incompatible with rescue and safety.
Learning from the Silsilavar bomb explosions in Pattaya, the UTI police have tightened the knees for a quick reaction during the celebration and during the emergency circumstances.
A total of 1800 officers will patrol all the main locations of the city, the crowded markets and other places, including vehicles and pedestrian for the duration of those who carry out other locations, including the prevention of strikes, teaching lessons to the men.
In these youths, the PCR, Traffic Unit including women police officers will be included.
In the city’s hotels, guest houses and other places including PG, police officers and commands will carefully check the duty tax records.
Thana SHO has been given instructions to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) for the finishing of cases.
In addition to the city’s VIP sectors, the DSP, including the Jimma Inspector, has been assigned to inspecting markets, malls and other places.
Following the emergency circumstances and the festival of the diwali, the high authorities have also determined the duty of additional police officers in the Madhdenzar Police Control of people's co-operation.
Police asked the staff of the Damkal department and the director of the PGI, the primary director and the DHS, including the sector-16 GMSH and the sector-32 GMCH management, to keep high alert in emergency times.
In order to teach lessons to the men, department officials have now placed on duty by giving the name of 'anti-gunda staff' under the leadership of the NGO, including women police staff.
The police officers of the Anti-Gunda Staff team will be tracking the people on the crowded places including the markets in simple clothes.
All the SHOs on the divalley have been ordered to put 44 nuts in the city's interior areas.
At the same time, the police officers will remain on the border of the city's 38 Naka points.
The bird left back in the forest by air transport for safety from North C Ridge
The bird found hunted on the North C Oil Rig has been left back from the coast to the forest by air transport.
The bird named Water Rail was sent to Aberdin by the former helicopter from the Scottish SPCA to recover to their Eloa rescue center.
Center manager Colin Seden explained: "This water rail was probably the winter migrant bird of Northern Europe, which came in the cheek of sharp winds above the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was tired and he took shelter on the oil rig.
He further explained: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
The water rail was healthy and clean before leaving.
Are Europe’s Higher Class Ready to Business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and promised to bring the business together and to determine what changes the UK employment and prosperity producers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For it, we asked them, conducting the largest and most detailed survey of British business leaders, what they thought about the UK’s business with the EU.
U-Gov proposed the ideas of 1,000 business leaders, who represent the business size, regions and locations of Britain.
The results of this survey may be surprising for many people.
We found that a large portion of entrepreneurs now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on the countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member countries are becoming unmoving.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, and not to be confused in the long-term and evil process of reforming the mysterious institutions of the EU.
When they asked their opinions about specific policy areas such as from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with regard to the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of the regulation in Brussels is far higher than the benefits of becoming part of the European trade sector - even 40 percent of the giant businessmen who were traditionally the supporters of European companies agreed on this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large portion clearly wants Britain to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, seen at the levels of major business groups, demonstrated that businessmen are motivated towards a "significant change" that will give the UK back its lost power.
It’s a very high price – the issue of a treaty change for Britain and a better deal has changed 16 percent of the votes in the vote collection, in favour of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey is a decade that British businessmen support their plan to negotiate the terms of the UK’s membership in the EU.
It also demonstrated that businessmen expect to revert the current power balance to make a meaningful change in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British, and very quickly it becomes mandatory, as it is moving forward towards the eurozone, the affiliate economy and the fiscal union.
Priority must necessarily be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show that for entrepreneurs it means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory procedure.
Gazprom's Alexey Miller told the pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new round
Gazprom’s chief said the backdrop of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the backdrop of Europe’s largest energy projects.
“Today has been a historic event: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe, has grown,” Gazprom’s chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russian export routes to Europe.
The officials said, where Ukraine has the majority of Russian gas for Europe, a dispute related to the agreement between Gazprom’s counterpart and Gazprom poses a risk for traditional routes.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, eliminating the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries "for ever".
After the full operation of this project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discount rates from South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Before accusations against Jonathan Lord, two employees of the W.M.C.A. were accused of sexual crimes, the Royal Commission heard
In 2011, before the charges against Caringbah child care employee Jonathan Lord were filed, two employees of W.M.C.A. N.S.W. have been charged with child sexual crimes.
But in his statement in front of the Commission, it said that it "has never argued the case of child sexual harassment within its organization," the Commission said.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the case in which a W.M.C.A. employee was charged with child pornography crimes, and another case in which W.M.C.A. Caringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual crimes against the children in his care in 1991.
The advocate assisting the Commission, Gell Farnes, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the statement of the W.M.C.A. in front of the Commission that “the U.M.C.A.’s external investigations have been carried out and they have found the W.M.C.A. the most advanced in the case of child safety” is also not accurate.
The Commission is the proof that the W.M.C.A. was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Green, who are linked to the age of 21 with W.M.C.A., acknowledged that the management "including myself" failed because of the appointment of Lord, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations related to reporting child safety policies violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes with 12 children during a two-year term in WMCA.
He was sentenced to prison for at least six years.
But Mr. Green denied the suggestion that the WMCA had a cultural problem, which led to the employees not reporting child safety violations by Lord.
What the employees saw about the breach, gave the evidence that Lord spent time alone with the children, personally babysitting them, adopting them, telling them he loves them and allowing them to play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord’s supervision, and who was told for child safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that Lord’s supervisioning W.M.C.A. Caringbah child service manager Jacqueline Bernat was “very threatening and hard to meet most of the time.”
C.E.O. said he did not accept the proof of employees that they were uncomfortable to report above their manager.
He said that, rather, his friendship with Lord confused his decision to report about him.
Mr. Green said that he had provided his approach to the W.M.C.A. N.S.W. Council that, the text for the organization from "Jonathan Lord Event" was about "not giving information".
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the privacy agreement by employees immediately after the accusation was made by W.M.C.A.’s child service manager, Liam Whiteley.
He said it was intended to avoid the blend of evidence, but it was not "unreasonable" and correctly executed.
Stephen Smalbon, Professor Special on Child Sexual Abuse at Griffith University, said that W.M.C.A. N.S.W. was not a secure organization during Jonathan Lord's office between 2099 and 2011.
He said that employees had "serious problems" in appointment, inspection, entry, training and supervision.
The hearing has been postponed for 20 December.
Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said he would want the chance to become British Prime Minister again - but he believes there is no possibility of return.
In an interview held at night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's office, the 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After a decade as a leader leaving his position in June 2007, Mr. Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to his role as representative of foreign affairs and the Middle East Peace Founders.
When asked whether they would want to return to the prime minister, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Evning Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it is not likely that it will happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the trader community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts showing the horse for the best horse of the year was gathered in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet to go to school and a few months away from taking his first step, this young child and his father-in-law Shetland's Tatu Taifi completed three stages very easily and received the top prize - he left his 30 adult rivals behind.
In the annual competition held by Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Cardiff's nearby Rudry, the unseparable couple - which is Sk same length - was greatly praised for the appearance, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, she pulled her flat hat on an alhud angle and turned her two-year-old toffy to the ring.
For their natural skills to control which is far beyond his age, the decision makers congratulated Fenton.
And Tofy got the highest points for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given toffy as a gift on her third birthday in March last year, and since then she has been exercising with this shuttle every day.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, “Fanton and Toffy are a fantastic couple.”
They had to face the challenge of all the attendees, but they both won the Golden Cup and the roulette.
This was the only second opportunity, when he had participated in a competition with Toffy, and we are all very happy with his victory.
The most different in this colour, she felt so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take pictures with her.
This little child from the nearby village of Nantiglo in Abwell, South Wales is walking on the traces of his uncle Sharon Howells who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howels said: “The whole space was full of enthusiasm, and every person was celebrating joy and playing the ball.”
He was running on the balloon in the whole colour, and despite looking so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is a sheep of animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares for.
As she has started, she will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am confident that she will perform greatly.
A spokesman for the Annual Horse Exhibition said: "Fanton's age is only three years, but he comes to control his tattoos."
They are very good couples.
The decision makers gave points taking into account the methods of Fenton and Toffy's performance and the methods of their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tatu and his rider - in this case Fenton and Tophie were the best in the ring.
I'm completely convinced that Fenton's cute clothes helped him, he really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper will be the “Green Rescue”
A Chinese newspaper that had appealed on the homepage to leave a reporter guilty of humanitarian harassment, will be rescued, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou newspaper New Express had given a viral public proof for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken the rescue to write a great news about the state’s partially owned company.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through a "full improvement".
The order of “reform” came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Event News Group's New Express had printed a lot of false news about the listed company Zumloyan in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was unstable."
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative penalty by "annulling the license of Chen Yongzhou's reporter."
It had "guided the Yangcheng Event News Group to make a complete improvement of New Express, presenting the people responsible for it in New Express and promptly modifying the New Express leadership team."
Mr. Chen wrote a lot of articles blaming financial irregularities in a construction-output company called Zumloyan in New Express.
After being dismissed, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, and said he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to state television and accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told state broadcaster C.C.T.V. that "in this case I have damaged Zumloyan as well as the whole news Meua industry and its ability to gain the confidence of people."
I did it mainly because I had a desire for money and fame.
I realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's forgiveness, New Express issued a homepage forgiveness, saying it failed to properly check his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have made TV broadcast defects.
Experts say that violent accusations are made from time to time, despite the fact that in the late half of this year a law banned officials from obliging a person to blame themselves.

U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the U.S.A. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The U.S. authorities have described the four-foot three-foot tunnel as one of the most complicated secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is approximately equal to the square length of six football pitches, which connects Tijuana, the nearest warehouse of Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with a-like warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck that is filled with drugs.
The officials said it was closed before a drug passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, officials have captured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine, in connection with the search for the tunnel.
Three persons, about whom officials they were acting as drivers, were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute.
If he is guilty, he may be sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment.
Nouglas, the traffickers in Arizona, take advantage of the enormous underground water extraction channels.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which makes the drug mafia groups capable of presenting the challenge of how they can deliver the product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a route of approximately 700 gadgets equipped with the railway track, which was spread from a house warehouse in Tijuana to the San Diego warehouses.

The British police sent an outsourcing notification to Assange.
The British police sent today an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken asylum at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and has requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had sent a "admission notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to be present at the police station, as well as said he would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Asange is facing extradition in Sweden due to sexual crime accusations, as well as his choice under British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition at the beginning of this month.
Stockholm will transfer him to the US, with this fear he had requested asylum at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19, calling for political asylum to the South American country.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard has sent "a resignation notice to the 40-year-old Assange, for which he needed to be present at the police station on the date and time we chose."
He is in violation of his terms.
The ambassador refused to comment on the notification of the police.
Assange is afraid that more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables will be released on the WikiLeaks anti-privacy website and will be deported from Sweden to the United States to face potential spy accusations.
Drivers at a speed of 130 miles per hour with hot drinks between the legs penalty of £1000 (£1,000)
On the driver, a fine of £1,000 (£1,000) for driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) by putting hot drinks between the feet.
The 35-year-old Andrew Hovey was seen running his Mercedes-Benz on A120 in Brentry on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a drink on their legs.
In the Colchester Magistrate Court, Howe has accepted the accusation of conducting car with negligence.
Their license added seven points, resulting in a ban on them to drive for six months.
Hovey was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and £100.
Tax on foreign property owners, the artificial situation of London will end
The Ministry of Finance has calculated the CGT measures primarily, but is waiting for the final decision from Mr. Osborne, who presented a stamp duty at a rate of 7 percent for houses with a price of more than 2 million pounds in the 2012 budget, and persons who prefer to hold houses in a company rather than a separate person.
In the tax year 2012/13 the stamp duty obtained from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was 708 million pounds, which is already more than the joint amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook explained: “After the increase in the stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidens Act, it is very difficult to discuss that the high-value property has less than reasonable tax, which has no connection with the influence of the old Council tax system.
He added that "but this step could make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and unwilling to sell current owners."
The top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market, which has spread from Fulham to Wimbledon, according to the price in Primal South-West London, has recorded an increase of 11.8 percent last year.
According to Saviels’ research, Central London’s values continued to grow regularly by 5.6 percent each year, but it seemed to be slightly lower than the growing “home market”, as the city’s southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) are observing a rise.
Scientists have further emphasized what the relationship is between the movements of the dog's neck and his mood.
Recent research has shown that happy dogs move their thumb more to the right (from the dog’s sight), while quiet dogs move their ribs mostly to the left.
But now scientists say that partner dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the rep and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in the Journal of Karant Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Georgia Wellertigra from the University of Trento explained: "In humans, it is all well known that the left and right parts of the brain are differently involved in the stimulation that generates positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He explained that, like humans, the right part of the brain was also responsible for the movements of the left hand and the opposite order, and the two semi-halves played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the unilateral shock by other dogs, researchers watched the animals watching other dogs' movies.
He measured the heartbeats of pets and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won’t take a long time to understand why their dumb sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Wellertigra explained: "We presented dogs with dog films - in a realistic version or in shadow-image to deal with other problems that put into confusion, and we could see the turning of the rib and present the rib more left or right."
When the animals saw an emotional dog swallowing their ribs to the right (the dog's sight), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the rib turning mainly to the left (from the dog’s sight), their heartbeat increased and they looked quiet.
According to Professor Wellertigra, they don’t think the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they think that the dogs have learned from their experience what behavior they should worry about and not what.
He said, “If you’ve met other dogs several times, and if they move their neck continuously to one side, it’s related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of the same experience.”
Researchers say these findings can provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with better information about the feelings of animals.
Follow the guest of the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, dog behavior expert John Bradshow explained that it is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, their heads turn to the left and their heads turn to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he explained: "Unlike the Italian study - when a robot's neck slapped to the left rather than expected to be right, the dogs were more likely to get closer than to be quiet."
He said this difference was because in various studies dog movies didn’t fully understand animals or robot dogs.
He clarified that it could help to study how dogs react to real dogs.
"While different mammals have found plenty of evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains to be obtained - and in this case dogs are no exception," he said.
However, considering how easily their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take more time to understand why their thumbs sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Because of Alex Turner's illness, Arctic Mankage has postponed Glasgow Gig
Rock Bank, named Arctic Mankage, has postponed the GIG in Glasgow after suffering from his leading singer's shock.
Sheffield group's program was set to show on the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But his chief singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to re-set the date of the show.
The announcement of the band came at the time when they were bound to postpone the Gig in the same way at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Mankage said: After taking medical advice this night after the decision to postpone the show in Birmingham LG Arena, Arctic Mankage must also postpone the show on November 1, Friday in Glasgow Hydro.
"In the investigation, Alex Turner was found to have been scratched, and they are sadly unable to perform."
The show will be on November 20 at LG Arena in Birmingham, and the show in Glasgow Hydro will be on November 21.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the First Cardinal in February
The Vatican on Thursday announced that Pope Francis will make the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
The cardinals, the Catholic Church, are the highest-class priests, their post is only below the Pope, and these are the people who choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his persons, who will eventually help to choose their successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope's election - it comes into the group of 120 "Cardinals Electorals".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardy said that before the ceremony of the promotion of the new cardinals, all existing cardinals will be held, which the Pope's Assembly calls.
Lombardy said, "Pope Francis has decided to notify his decision to hold the Pope's Council in February in advance, so that it is easier to plan other meetings with the participation of the cardinals from different countries of the world."
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline by February.
The Pope generally proclaims the number of cardinals elected as low as 120, the number of cardinals, and the names of cardinals over the age of 80 according to his will.
Valero said, the next year’s Pope’s Assembly will be important, because this year’s March will be the first Pope’s Assembly after Francis was elected.
Nowadays there is a kind of prejudice to Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope, the cardinals are nominated for the rest of the world to restore the balance.
Thirty percent in South America are Roman Catholics, but their number in the cardinals is very small.
The Cardinal Council by Francis, which consists of a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose task is to seek ways to reform the Church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after the formation.
The Pope decided all things by himself.
Valero said, “Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him.”
He said that it is so "possible" that Francis will ask for advice from the cardinals.
But we are not first in this situation – it’s completely new.
Valero said that the pope generally gives the post of cardinal to the bishop of major places, but Francis "was completely surprising - so we don't know whose name they will declare."
To correct the seatback, GM called back pickup trucks in the U.S.
According to a report by U.S. Auto Safety Regulators on Friday, General Motors Company has called back about 19,000 trucks to correct a lack of hand-wheeled seatback in its completely new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and G.M.C. Sierra pickup truck.
Some trucks may have a decrease in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, Seatback, head retransmitters failed to comply with auto safety standards.
According to a statement posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is stuck from the back, it is possible that the head restant could not properly protect the driver, which will increase the risk of injury."
The calling back models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
GM’s trucks began to be shipped in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, it reflects the most important wagon launch for top U.S. automakers.
G.M. told the truck owners about this fault in the last half of October.
N.S.T.M.A. 16 days of government imprisonment, which stopped the increase in automotive sales in October, was not able to review the owner's notification letter.
G.M. said on Friday, the sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had an increase of 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the stock exchange in New York was up 1.4 percent.
The disappointment of Obama’s voters
I voted for Obama twice in anticipation of change.
He says that Obama’s great efforts have been interrupted due to the policy of blocking G.O.P.
The blockage policy of Obamacare's website misconduct, drones cannot give excuse for attacks
Obama's 2008 Campaign Remembrance Reminds What Could Be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books today.
This is a book about which I think this second year will encourage me during the toxicity of the medical school and raise the radiation of hope in me.
It’s called “the courage to win”, and it’s a reminder of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I find my patient's prescriptions in the night and go to bed, this book leads me into a period in which politics has inspired millions of people and speech can stop your breath.
The elections were unilaterally proven, and news speakers had taken a break to reflect the historical importance of that time.
The eyes of my colleagues were ashrus of joy, and my parents saved every newspapers they met.
A team of young visionary individuals went to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
During Obama's presidency in 2008, he had 82 percent approval ratings.
Then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a rigorous truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It’s hard to remember those days of hope – they seem to be a remembrance of a distance, a sad remembrance of lost opportunities.
After the first time I voted, there was a real change.
Simply said, I couldn’t even imagine anything.
I trust Obama a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, to the end of “Don’t ask” until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposition has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country, including immigration reform, public options for health services, closing stations on Guantanamo Bay, and more.
But the countless time in which I took part in the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I got the answer that I could give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republican’s opposition policy is not a response to the spy of foreign leaders, nor is it a response to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency’s storage of data about the private life of ordinary U.S. citizens, nor can it respond to the prosecution of people exposing government’s wrongdoing.
This cannot explain without any trial the cause of the murder of the American citizen Anwar El Awaky, nor the public funds and expenditure limits that were reduced during the presidential campaign.
It can’t respond to the conclusions of that report, which says the White House’s efforts to silence the media “have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it cannot give excuse to failure to design a simple website even three years after it was signed in the Law of the Affordable Care Act.
I don’t know what I expected of it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have assumed that the rule system could reject the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is clear that the elected office is not a predictive way, as opposition political parties and random events such as the Newtown murder, will shape our public discussion.
However, the examples I have given above seem to be mostly selected by the administration.
This is what annoys you most.
I re-voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mit Romney presented a confusing and uncertain option, which did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I thought a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of future elections, will fulfill the hopes we have long heard about.
However, while Obama’s approval ratings are below 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return through that book in 2008.
When I see him, I remember his missing promises.
I was reading a part of the book this week, which described how Clinton had a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his underlying employees that they need to return to the trail, and to remain authentic on their goals.
He said, “I want to get my mozo back.”
We must remember who we are.”
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I can’t agree more with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that P.M. Tony Abbott's interests are struggling about the parental leave plan
Billionaire M.P. Clive Pamer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s interests are struggling about the parental leave plan because his daughters may be pregnant, and can take advantage of it.
The master of the mining sector, who is in dispute about the payment of $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Pamer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be important in determining the reduction of carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the ministers can have an interest struggle, and said Mr. Abbott’s daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
Mr. Palmer said, “They may have a significant conflict of interest in the case of maternal leave, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest in whether they get a vacation or not.”
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner with 53 votes of the Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat.
Mr. Palmer called for the election counting to move the process forward rapidly.
Tony's daughters are Francis and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after the election?
He said, “We need to have a better system.”
Why can’t it be that we have a system in which we fill our conversion on the computer, vote immediately and get the results at 6:30 am.
Mr. Pamer also criticized the use of the pencil to put signs on the votes.
That's because if someone doesn't like him, they can remove him.
It seems quite absurd to use the pencil today.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint interview with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said his policies include building an international airport for Sunshine Coast, and he took his new work "very seriously".
Public service is for public service.
“We don’t want any other prize except the history prize that we can serve the community at this important time.”
Those who had trouble.
Addressing the meeting held on this occasion, Bar association chairman Ramesh Singh Negi expressed intense anger on the worsening law-making in the province.
He said that the rapidly growing attacks on the defenders and their families prove that the criminals have become fearless.
There is no fear of the police system.
He recently mentioned such events that occurred in different locations, saying that when the advocate society is not safe, the security of the common man can be intuitively assumed.
RBS suspended two Forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, the case has received this information from two people, this is another indication that the global investigation-investigation carried out by regulators in suspicious manipulation of the currency market is moving forward with a slow pace.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Dutch Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with regulators in the world’s largest financial market with a daily exchange of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with the continuing investigation of the case that appears to repeat the Libor Interbank loan manipulation.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from the lawmakers this month.
Two weeks ago the bank had said, “Our investigation in this case is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators.”
Last month, scientists from the case had said that RBS was sent to the former trader and the records of emails and quick messages received from them have been sent to the UK regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Usher left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been dismissed from his current position as the European chief of Forex Spot Trading in J.P. Morgan.
The chief of European Spot Trading in City, Rohan Ramchandani, went on vacation last week, while former senior currency traders in Barclays and UBS were suspended by the Standard Charter this week.
No one of these traders has been accused of any wrong act.
Scientists from the case that Mr. Usher's fast message group includes Barclays and Citigroup's bankers.
UBS said that, the Swiss regulator, after Finna was informed that he is investigating the suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks, this week he has taken action against some of his employees.
At a global level, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finland, Switzerland’s Competition Authority VCO, FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating accusations of being misleading on the bankers to make their favourable fluctuations in the currency market.
People familiar with the case that, HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigation, or have received a request for information on behalf of the regulators.
Banks have been thoroughly investigating equal fast messages and e-mails for many years in search of clues of a misconduct.
The news about the investigation-survey has given a blurry to traders in such a sector, who have been among the leading individuals with the most profits in the trading unit of investment banks over the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, because the low volatility in currencies has reduced the opportunities for betting players.
Some banks have tried to push the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very enormous and highly liquid exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely enormous size of foreign currency purchase-sales, the division of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platform by banks means that “you can begin to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price.”
The news came the same day when Credit Suisse announced that the trader will be served this week from its Exchange Trading Funds Desk in London, which lost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has immediately notified the coherent authorities and is working with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said, “We believe that the trader was acting alone, and he was controlled.”

Supreme Court supports Obama’s Health Services Act
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
With 5-4 votes, the judges decided in favour of the separate order of the Patient Safety and Treatment Act - under which citizens will need to purchase or punish health insurance before the year 2014 - that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Judge John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court has also supported the remaining articles of this law of 2700 pages, and said that the condition of the healthcare law that the state will increase the medical qualification or they will lose all federal medical funding is not unconstitutional.
The request was brought to 26 states, and the National Independent Business Association, to prevent this law.
During the 2012 opening session, this law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including the candidate nominated person Mith Rumuni.

I am calling on the country’s political panda, the economists.
Some parameters are set in the country.
What the team did.
If it comes to a comparative result, it will not come to the question before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.

This country is a witness that Atal Bihari Wajpei and Morarji Desai's government had a low cost.
The poor man had to eat for two hours.

In the case of Nortel Patent, Google, Sasseng, Hui are subject to economic proceedings.
A group owned by thousands of former Nortel Patents has submitted a lot of patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it had plunged into the Nortel bankruptcy auction, on Thursday.
The association called Rockstar, which had purchased Nortel patents for 4.5 billion, has appealed against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., H.T.C. Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for breach of patents at the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The lawsuit said that these patents also include the technology that combines the words searched on the Internet with the words from consistent advertising, which is the main part of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and H.T.C. These are all such phones, which run on Google’s Android operating system, which is strictly confronted with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel Patents.
Google eventually offered $4.4 billion, increasing the offer several times.
After losing from the Rockstar in the Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a major reason for which Motorola had a long list of patents.
In the prosecution, it was said that "although Google has broken in the attempt to acquire Patents-in-Sout in Nilaami, Google has broken, and is constantly breaking."
Rockstar has demanded increased compensation against Google, as it claims that Google’s breach of patents is malicious.
Believe in the first independently elected president in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has sworn on his post, but his victory day in Egypt hardly ended political conflict.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he sworn in as the country's first independently elected president, replacing the 16 months ago removed Hosni Mubarak.
On its formal domination before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arabs have become the world’s first independently elected Islamist president, and the fifth president of Egypt after the removal of the republic 60 years ago.
He swore on his chair in front of the 18 judges of the court's black lobby on the shore of the river Neil, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony showed in live broadcast on the national television, Morsi said, “We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and another republic.”
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has passed 84 years since its establishment as an illegal organization, and which has been on the target of past governments, the 60-year-old engineer of the party trained in the U.S. Morsi said that "today the people of Egypt have put the foundation of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers safeguarded the building and, according to local time, Morsi arrived in the small cabin of cars shortly after 11 a.m. in the morning.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered outside the court to give congratulations to the new president, apart from the presidential dam from the time of Mubarak, and the traffic was also stopped for a while, so that their motorcycle can go out of the usually busy road, which connects the city center to its southern suburbs.
The personal reputation of Morsi, who was laughed as Brotherhood’s non-carismate “free tire”, increased considerably after his victory and his Friday speech presented him not only as Islamist but as the candidate of all those who want to complete the task of the 2011 revolution against the dictatorship.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tape, sworn before the judges sitting in a wooden panel room, saying that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After him Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he had to give his opening speech.
The military band was officially welcomed by playing the national song, while they stood in a position of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshall Hussein Tantavi was also present.
At their arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university there welcomed with the slogan that "the army and the people are one hand."
Founded as the foundation of secular education in 1908, Cairo University later became the foundation of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi held a symbolic oath on Friday at the Tahir Square, which is the starting point of the revolution that ended the dictatorship of Mubarak last year, and held a oath to withdraw the presidential powers taken from his post by the military council from the removed leader last year.
But practically by agreeing to take the official jury before the court instead of the parliament's authority to take the jury, they tend before the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currencies.

The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow - these two will be the first subjects in which revolutionary changes will be.
It will also change in other main topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam will show the changes that will occur in the regulatory Offcual, the new grade system, and the structure of the G.C.S.E. with a lower course.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gow said that “there was much more consensus about that, to restore people’s confidence we need to improve our self-examination system,” he said that ‘G.C.S.E. will be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies found that English schools dedicate less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours a week less during sessions than in most countries.
According to comparison, Australian school students offer an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore is an average of 138 hours.
While there will be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the widespread mathematics G.C.S.E. - League table was likely to encourage supplementary teaching in schools from being combined for overweight with subjects.
This course will focus more on "real world problems" including financial mathematics.

The wind bansal surrounded in opposition questions on the rail gate put the opposition in a place saying that he didn't see anyone's woman in 15 years.
Everyone was surprised where the woman came from.

If they were made a witness in the case, will they be made after the full scan?
Bansal said that in the booth scandal they are talking about this, only for a necessitated person he had written a letter.

He also said about his speech that there is no other sense in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
The new challenges are to be dealt with.
It was also the feeling on the head's face that he took the singer's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had made an urge from the chief to honor the activists in the Chittagong camp and to save them from the alleged persecution of the officers.
However, they also said they are ready to dismiss the ministry to keep their speech.
By the way, there is a new way of thinking in the matter of placing the activists on government positions after the outgoing opinion in the thinking camp.
In the camp, the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Vishishti Narayan Singh, said that the announcement of the nomination of the activists in 20 sources committees will be soon.
Their sign also was that the list is almost ready.
The news comes that now the chief of state, Nietiš Kumar, will compensate for the list from his level.
They will also check whether the legislative-parliamentary opinion has been taken to make a list or not.
If necessary, the list will be substantially changed to place old and committed workers.
The lawmakers-parliamentarians are commonly accused of not taking the opinion of those people in making the list of mononians.
The names of the people who came from the other parties much later have been recorded in the list while many important activists have been neglected since the same party’s days.
Some people are born with a silver spoon so some make life an ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.

Awareness Bureau, Srinagar: Police have allegedly removed the security of former minister Slav Hassan Khan who joined Congress from the People's Democratic Party.
Khan said the state government was responsible for this, saying his security was removed for political reasons.
The slave Hassan Khan Mufti Mohammed Saeed who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket of the year from the shops was included in his ministry while he was the prime minister.
Slav Hassan Khan said I had a security arm since 1996.
I am living in the streets of terrorists.
A security gloves of the CRPF at my house were placed under the leadership of the inspector.
I'm also with the guardians, but on Friday all my safety was suddenly taken back.
When the safety hand was going out of my house, I spoke to the district and to the district.
But instead of recovering security, he just said he would investigate the case.
Of course, in this context when Kashmir's IGP Abdul Gani Meir was contacted, he denied the information of the case, saying that this is a sensitive case.
I’m going to investigate myself how the security of a former minister and senior Siaci leader has been removed.
Deputy Chief of Congress, Prof. Saffudin Sojs, said that there is nothing like that in my information.
If there is a deal with Hassan Khan's security, it's a very serious thing.
I am currently in Jammu in the next two days I will come to Kashmir.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent 8.5 million rupees during the last four years to celebrate the victory of Sirdar Patel.
Instead, the reverses of Modi's claims in the NDA's rule period (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Vihari Bajpei's PM during a period such as when it came up to two consecutive years (2001-2002) no advertisement was issued by the government above Patel.
On Thursday in Gujarat's Kevadia, Modi, holding the base shell of the 182 meters high 'Statchu of Unity' statue of Sirdar Patel, said, 'Before this, there was no advertising on the occasion of Sirdar Patel's celebrations.
While DAVP’s records show that UPA has spent 30 million in 2009-10, 4.10 million in 2010-11, 2.7 million in 2011-12 and 1.4 million in 2012-13.
When Central Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tivari was asked about Modi's claims, he said that BJP's PM candidates don't talk on the basis of facts.
UPA did not bring any ads on Patel in 2008.
He said that this was because of the year.
Although the amounts spent on the advertisements of Sirdar Patel are significantly less than the amounts spent on the joints and purity of the members of the Nehru-Gandhi family each year.
DAVP spent 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's जयंती and Punyati, 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and 9.38 crore for Jawahar Red Nehru on print ads.
When Manish Tivari was asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including things like the size of the advertising or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that this reveals our devotion, whose opponents are trying to handle the inheritance of a great leader without going about it.
Today he will meet with the families of the people killed in the Pattaya Rally last Sunday.

Meanwhile, questions have also begun to raise on the BJP’s bone-kallash journey that was taken away with the people killed in the Pattaya explosion.
The head of state, Nietiš Kumar, is accused of breaking the BJP environment.
Progress from soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. George Well is providing free health services in rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There is not a lot of doctors in Western African countries; there is only a doctor for 5,000 people.
Give your vote here or through the mobile.
Dr. George Wells is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for them or someone else in the top 10 to make the hero of the CNN year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Wells had seen his sick father coming in awareness and being unconscious, going to the hospital, who had not been properly facilitated to help him.
Jamel Well was injured in a car crash near Yunde, the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
In the beginning, his only hand was broken, but an infection grew that spread to his brain, and he produced a blood clot, which affected his rest of life.
George Wells says, “There was no neurosurgen in Cameroon.”
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Will was taking his father to a very crowded clinic and hospitals and received any treatment he could get.
Well said, “It’s not easy.”
You leave the house at 5 a.m. in the hope that you will be the first person to get to the hospital, but that doesn’t happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can get in the mouth of death waiting.
The situation has not changed much since Will's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If compared, there is a physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there are doctors there, even many inhabitants of Cameroon can’t bear its expenses.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the healthcare spending in the country is of the private sector.
Well says, “Their only problem is poverty.”
And because of being poor, they can’t enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his nationals, Will decided to solve it somewhat.
Dr. George and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgeries last year.
They themselves became doctors, and began to work as a vascular surgeon at Yunde's Center Hospital.
And they launched the non-profit organization Escowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and about 30 people sit in the wagon, binding medical supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to move forward by pushing the vehicle more than once from the rivers and the soil.
But when they arrive, they get a truly heroic honor: holidays, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that can be offered by the community.
Free medical service in these villages is really the reason to celebrate, and the valley – with its great smile and infinite energy – includes happiness and happiness.
The next morning, their team begins to meet with hundreds of Romans.
Well said, “We meet 500 people in each trip.”
They come about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
These weekends clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a bag, donated glasses or a free birth certificate—this document is required in school but many unemployed families cannot pay for it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in the school building, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient goes and goes to the recovery place, and makes room for the next person.
The group’s generator publishes sanitation equipment in the operating rooms, and Wells and their volunteers work up in the morning on Sunday.
It’s a slow speed, but the village musicians usually help keep the team inspired.
Well said, “They’re playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work.”
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including medical doctors and foreign medical students from the Cameroon - has done 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One man told me that because of receiving free hernia surgery he would be able to go to work again.
He said, “This will change the future of me and my family.”
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Well also works at a private medical clinic around Yunde at night.
He explained that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is filled with private donations.
The second year medical student and volunteer at the Dracula University in Philadelphia, Katy O'Maley said, "I don't know when they're sleeping."
They are always either in the hospital, or are trying to make money for their organization, so that they continue to run these campaigns.
Students of medicine and nursing like O'Mali who come from the United States and Europe to join the Wales campaign have this experimental opportunity, which they can never get in their country.
O'Maley said, "In the therapies in which we help Dr. Well hold tools or cleanse blood spots, we are able to gain experimental experience."
As a second-year medical student in the United States you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend from their nearby to reach the Cameroon, and they often come with donation medical supplies.
But after the Younde arrives, they stay, and the instructions take the costs.
O'Mali says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Well, the burden of work almost like one, is not difficulty.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to your father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
Well says, “I’m very happy when I do this work.”
I think about my father.
I hope they’ll see what I’m doing.
I’m doing it to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
Check out the website and find out how to help.
You will not be sure, but it is true.
Not just that the name of the Mission Road has been named by the City Council President Anjali Kumari.
Indeed, the Zharkand development youth front has named it to show its anger with some bad streets of the city.
This program was conducted by the Central Secretary of Zhumo, Truthyand Pandey.
Speaking to a rally, Modi said, "If you see the speeches of Congress or Republican leaders in the past two months, then you will find that they don't talk about what they've done."
He said, “Kongress has become so egoistic that it doesn’t answer the media’s questions.”
Manmohan Singh is the prime minister and his government, yet they need to respond with Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibble who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants his control environment where he gives his speech and does not talk to them to avoid questions with journalists.
Sibble also challenged Modi to face the debate.
Modi said, "I promise to the people of the country that when the BJP will form a government in 2014, then we will present a report before the people every year."

Obama's healthcare offer has been withdrawn
In the midst of criticisms, President Obama backed yesterday his often repeated misleading promise that "if you like your health plan, you can continue it."
Along with millions of people receiving dismissal information from their suppliers, Republicans have recently criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "many people who have health insurance, and it is useful, can continue it."
Referring to the demolition he calls the “slip of news”, Obama has grateful to buy new coverage in the market from U.S. citizens who receive this information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, just as much money or even cheaper than proposed a comprehensive healthcare plan.
He said, “You’ll find a better deal.”
The administration said it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be bound to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the desired standards under the Chartered Care Act.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebastian said, “I tell these American citizens directly that you deserve better.”
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of that tolerable care Act, said the launch of the online market since October has been "unfortunate".
He said, “I’m disappointed and angry like others.”
I want to regain your belief.
After a sharp talk with the Republican yesterday sitting behind him in the house hearing, a companion from Sebelius said this phrase angry, which a Mike caught Billy Long, R-Mo about whether they would need to be registered in Obamacare.
In a more than three hours long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the “architect” of the Caribbean Care Act did not voluntarily give up the government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare Dot Gow, which he is now selling to millions of Americans.

There were only 31 cases registered from 22 to 27 October.
There were also cases of violation of the election.
There were a lot of complaints in the early days, but it has been reduced.
It is said that in the early days there were more complaints against political parties due to the lack of full information about the behavior code.
Because of the political parties being aware of the election commission and taking lessons from the registered case, complaints are now coming.
Many parties were promoting elections as before in lack of information, but when action against them took place, they stopped it.
Political parties are following it with obtaining information about the electoral behavior code.
This also decreases the cases of its infringement.

This mystery has brought the U.S. government a diplomatic geography in relation to its allies.
Speaking through video links at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no question that the president, me, and other people in the government were really aware of some things that would happen with the automatic pilot, because looking back then the Second World War, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11 had its capacity.
They have become the first high-class members of the U.S. government, who have admitted that U.S. spy has extended its boundaries, but have emphasized that no one’s rights have been abused.
He said, “In some cases, it has gone far ahead inappropriately.”
And the presidents are firmly determined to try to clarify this to the people and are now on a thorough review so that any person does not have a sense of abuse.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with the innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that, however, the NSA was striving for good purposes, and its monitoring has saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a world where people are ready to explode themselves.”
There is a radical aggression in the world, which is committed to killing people and bombing them and attacking governments.

We have actually saved the aircraft from falling, buildings destroyed, and people were killed because we are able to know about the plans of others.
During this time, the Chairman of the Senate of European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to help solve concerns abroad about the so-called U.S. spy, and will try to convince European countries about the need to continue anti-corruption efforts together with the U.S.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he has talked with members of the European Parliament and other people this week and is concerned about the threats that he will stop his participation in anti-terrorist organizations due to the surveillance by the National Security Agency.
President of the First-elected Democratic Party and Senate of European Affairs Foreign Relations Subcommittee Murphy said, in an interview with Washington, “It is really important for U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in the context of our anti-terrorist efforts.”
European countries need to continue working together to clarify that fighting terrorism should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
News recording millions of European telephone conversations by the NSA has brought shortcomings in relation to some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said these news are not completely correct, and reflects a misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the United Nations stored by NATO allies.
Other revelations in the documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top leaders in the world, including German chancellor Agnella Merkel.
National intelligence director James Clapper declared it necessary to defend the incident of spying on the allied countries and said it is common to be done by both sides.

The names of the participants will be released in the coming days.

He said that European leaders will have to be honest with their people, also with their spyware programs that have been used for years.
Murphy said, "While we can modify our monitoring program to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only one who is spying."
During this weekend, Mr. Carrie’s program is to go to the Middle East and Poland, where he will solve the research on U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to U.S. monitoring activities.

Australian woman appeals against Thai prison period
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Fuket for mistaken accusation of the attack on a taxi driver, she has appealed against the decision and has been sentenced.
On June 15, the Fuket Provincial Court found Steve Russell Bomford guilty of misguided accusations against the Thai police, accusing him of trying to stop him by a local taxi driver on Sunday morning on June 10 together with two other persons.
But later C.C.T.V. footage revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after separating from her Australian Boyfriend.
Fuket accepted to build the story after being interrogated by the police for two days from Bamfort.
He was placed in the local police cabin before hearing.
Bambford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in the low-security cleaning center in the outer area of Fuket instead of a prison with adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunes, who has requested to help her daughter from the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra.
Tunes told Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is "extremely concerned" about the care of his daughter and they want to call her back to Australia.
Tunes said, "It was undoubtedly a worrying time for us, but we hope he will be home as soon as possible."
Bamfood has appealed against the punishment order, and 50,000 have been granted.
During this period, a report in Australia said she was celebrating holidays at the Craby's holiday place in southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said Bambford's case was being fought by a local advocate in Fuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to stay in adult prison.
