I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I crossed out the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I suggested it.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I gave up smoking pot.
I gave up.
I raise cattle.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read a story to Tom.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice if you kept quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I first met the queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I flushed one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain.
I said open the door.
I said we're closed.
I said yes.
Is there anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
- Is there anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw it.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister cut the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far from here?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Does Dan know what he's done?
Are the potatoes calorific?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I see", said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston amongst me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everyone happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is it all there?
- Are you breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I nodded my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I have to take her home.
I have to pack.
I have to go change.
I should probably go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I should check.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold out?
- Is that it?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or is it just me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
- Is that true? - Yes.
I put a strap on him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a log.
I slept in the pit.
I slept on the bus.
I cut the sandwich upside down.
Has Mike stopped drinking alcohol?
I smiled.
Isn't that exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that a little excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent all day clearing snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I ran into something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Is there even a word for that?
Is that really necessary?
Is that really necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Does Tom think that's what happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it payable for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
- Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is that a real diamond?
Is that morally correct?
Is that correct in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is there someone sitting here?
Is this seat available?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love a horse.
I stole it from them.
Can Tom swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Did Tom piss you off?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did Tom talk to you?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the darkroom.
I'm a student of art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I have asthma.
I suggest you study more.
I suggest we concentrate on finding a way out of the cave.
I say we go home.
I'm starving to death to bend over.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't fight you if you were the last bucket of water.
I'm sweating every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I've been talking to my advisors about what subjects to take.
It all makes sense.
It all seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
So it wasn't a no.
- That's not possible.
It's your business.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, ever, ever could that happen here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That would be nice.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
I'm not bothered.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm learning English.
I'm in the middle of it.
That gave me an idea.
I got things to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening now.
It's happening now.
It's getting cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I think about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I might have a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I write pretty good.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might nod.
I think I'm going to be fine.
I think I should stare at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's a good dancer.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom has gone.
I think Tom is not breathing anymore.
I think Tom is heartless.
I think Tom is conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom is crazy.
I think Tom is dying.
I think Tom is funny.
I think Tom is beautiful.
I think Tom is tough.
I think Tom is hurt.
I think Tom is mean.
I think Tom is nice.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is a petty person.
I think Tom is a pussy.
I think Tom is rich.
I think Tom is right.
I think Tom is hot.
I think Tom is vain.
I think Tom is sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom is going.
I think we can catch him.
I think we'd better not drink this water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join you.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're freaking out.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
I think you've been set up.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was in there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was getting it.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
- Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna be a busy man.
Well, you didn't want the reward, did you?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
So you hate him, don't you?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls shorter than you.
So you could play the piano?
So you said you could swim?
So, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played better chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts so bad here.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the cup cover up.
It's a multi-step process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
I can't answer that question.
There's no theoretical chance I can finish the job in a day.
It's less humid today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not finished yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
May I use that?
I'm paying for it.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's getting into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
A famous passage from his essay is worth quoting.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written all over his face.
It just feels wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's going to be okay.
It's almost Christmas.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's going to be okay.
It'll be worth it.
He looked awful.
It looked funny.
You seem to be right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
It looks familiar.
It looks like an egg.
I must have had too much to drink last night, my head is killing me, I'm really hungover.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two have settled down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He's got me.
It worries me.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
It might rain tonight.
It may seem strange.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it is.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It's possible it's going to rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have made it up.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them.
I reported to the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it was gonna be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna be a pain.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm coming around.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom out to lunch.
I'm not wearing pants.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably not worth the wait.
It was two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain, but he wouldn't push the button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I'm really sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to get all worked up.
It's about to rain.
That's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check for any side effects if you drink alcohol while taking your prescribed medication.
It's a child's play.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over for us.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's about to leave.
It's really fun.
It's already 7:00.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false lead.
It's a risky plan.
It's too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's a quick walk.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They broke it.
You've only caused me pain.
It's been raining for a week or so.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
It's been an unusually hot week.
You'd better not talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than a pessimist and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees". "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
The sauna is here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's closing time.
He's studying here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
You can tell the difference easily.
I must have misjudged him.
It's kind of her style.
It seems to me that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's wrong to curse.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's only fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny, you know?
Watching TV is fun.
Get dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be brutal.
It's getting colder.
It's going to happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's all right.
It's all better now.
It's really fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot in hell here.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in perfect condition.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question of where.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little further up.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I'm the one who decides, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring you presents like this.
It's nice to feel needed.
It's not a big surprise.
It's not a big surprise.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a high priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It won't be easy to do without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
It's not a big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not a regular pen.
There's not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
- That's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not often someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's only a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds pretty cool.
That sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's white all over.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's a hole.
It's actually pretty common.
It's really good.
I could be wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's really simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so wonderful.
It's so complicated.
But he's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It still doesn't work.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's funny how people in the tropics eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck in the air.
The surface was as flat as a mirror.
It's about time.
This is the best chili I've ever tasted.
It's a spider web.
I'm so scared!
Time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
Eptane is strong.
It's a piece of shit.
It's wrong.
She can't stand the heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's not natural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
I'm guessing no matter what.
There's a wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's your call, Tom.
It's all yours.
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
It went on all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the light.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was really beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
This was an arena day.
It was a great show.
This whole thing was my idea.
It was okay here.
It was all so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was a setup.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
I felt like I was being owed the opportunity to spend the evening with a smart, witty, beautiful girl like you.
It was an amazing experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a beautiful evening.
That was childish of him.
It was nasty.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun last night.
It was getting dark.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my mistake.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it was gonna be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It's been proven that the spiders that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was really magnificent.
It was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was breathing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day, we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
It was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was hanging on the fireplace.
It was Tom.
It was too close.
It was pathetic.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unfathomable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very stuffy in that room because all the windows were closed.
It was better.
It was worth a shot.
It was your mistake.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be long.
I won't be alone here.
It won't cost you a thing to fix it.
Lies won't help.
It's not gonna help you.
It works fine.
It would be perfectly normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I can get you to explain everything.
I need you right now.
I was watching you earlier.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I use that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I already read it.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone to help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with other things.
I've been all over town looking for Dom.
I've been through a lot worse.
I was betrayed.
I was notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing the bell for hours.
I was miserable.
I was careless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I was gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping.
I was helping them.
I was hired to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been pretty busy.

There's no need to panic.
You shouldn't wear anything that sucks.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't know business.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.

You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
