Barack Obama is the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo for 26 hours to be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The Diploma, Medal and Cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolitan city in the morning with his wife, Michelle, and will have a lot of trouble.
He first visits the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which was elected in October by 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple will then have a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
This afternoon, the visit will turn to the peak of a ceremony on which Obama will take over the prestigious prize.
He will be the fourth president of the United States, but only the third who will receive the prize directly in the office.
The White House has announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan.
The president does not want to avoid this topic, because he realizes that the prize takes over as the president, who is currently fighting in two countries.
The war efforts a few days ago even increased by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which will not be forgotten to emphasize any of its critics.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of 10 million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
They intend to give for charity purposes, but a specific charity has not yet decided.
The program will be carried out by the President with the desire to be introduced to the banket, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and the queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 guests will be invited.
Obama has been more discontinuous at the price from the beginning.
He said he felt he didn’t deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price only for him, but for everyone who seeks the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "challenge to action" for him.
Conservatives accused of harassment
Litoměřica police accused the Chairman of the Citizen Association of the Society of Nature Conservatives of the Litoměřice for the harassment.
In several cases in the past year he appealed to some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of the appeal he demanded money from investors for his benefit, said Lithuanian police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The Chairman of the Litoměřic Society of Conservatives of Nature is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in prison and risks up to three years in prison.
Containers don’t smell much.
In Prague, ordinary people can classify packaging from drinks, and in the South Moravia villages you will meet the classification containers at every step.
And in Brunei?
There to save yourself a few minutes before you find the right strawberries.
I don’t want to say that there is no waste at all.
But it comes to me that by the fact that we are the second-largest city in the Republic, the councillors are not interested enough in this issue.
Brno is in the forest league of waste classification not only by the fact that as citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into the classification containers, but above all by the number of rubbishes for such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to throw a PET bottle into a collection basket?
It’s a finished cushion, especially it requires time and strong nerves.
The only place I have seen is on the Moravsk Square in front of the Potrefené Huse.
Don’t be angry with my colleagues, but I don’t think it’s good.
Not to mention that even in other parts there is no distribution of waste honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to waste.
from leness.
They are far from the strawberries.
I am not surprised by them.
After the celebration I offered myself to throw out a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
I have not seen any colored sandwichs on the street.
Fortunately, I found the right place on the way to the shalin.
But the waste flowed from it.
This is the city’s most popular city, right?
But the ecology and some aesthetics of the Brno socialists are not much interested.
The city would rather buy a hockey extraliga, which would make us shame throughout the Republic, rather than purchasing a couple of containers in addition and offering the classification of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I could confirm my assumption after a moment of browsing on the internet by official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubkov's budget takes money for retirement and health care
After the left added, despite the government’s opinion, to farmers or officials, there is no need to be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also on interest on state debt or on international judicial disputes.
This will bring trouble to those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When Social Democrats and Communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relied that the government would add to sensitive expenditure, pensions or sickness. ”It’s just the delay of problems into the future, the putting mines,” says Janota.
The interest rates are increasing and sometimes they have to get back.
The state has no power to choose where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the costs of the state, they must raise taxes.
All that the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
About pensions or illnesses, from whose accounts have disappeared 1.8 billion, people don’t have to be afraid, they’ll get them.
However, at the price of the state’s more debt – the next year will not be missing in the cash only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janoty, the debt will grow faster and faster, along with the interest costs.
The state will need money to pay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase the VAT or lower the maternity, as the government has done in its counterdeficit package.
As a result of the money transfer to the benefit of several voter groups, there will also be a shortage of five billion dollars for the construction of highways and railways next year.
This is mostly the already exhausted and built sections, which can not be re-projected and eventually dissolved.
It is free, which is also not free.
This means the delay or the stop of thirty large buildings, and the European money is also threatened, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that the loss of money will be solved by Salamounsky – it will touch the dividends of the CEZ, which the state is mostly owned, and from them the transportation fund will add.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain, and it is no longer an untouchable source.
Last year, the budget amounted to $18 billion.
Each year, the dividend is paid for the liquidation of environmental damage, the pension account is supplemented or serves as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit to a level of 5.7 per cent of GDP.
This does not end the carnival.
Nearly three billion were left in the budget for various compensation to the victims of communism and crimes or for spending on judicial disputes, even on construction savings.
If the state will go without this money, it’s not certain.
This is a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we will have to pay the same, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resortion or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the already launched $2 billion project of the State Treasury, which is intended to enable online to track what the individual authorities are spending for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing one button.
The disclosed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you will move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This option is aimed at the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of computer virtualization software.
We will enable you to run two user profiles at the same time on your mobile.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualizing smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was modified by the Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which alongside each other running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full flow.
Now VMware is working with European and U.S. operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and the devices are expected to reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hotels
The holes don’t worry only about the crocodiles.
The lack of snow distracts people even from ordering ski stay in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, there are still free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Visitability on our website is great.
People go through the offers, find the prices, but so far they are afraid of binding ordering.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year’s Christmas will be on the snow or on the blade,” said Spindl.Info’s operator Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants a new year stay in Spindler's Mlyn precisely according to his ideas, would say no longer have to hesitate with the order.
Whoever gives the preference to save money and the quality of the accommodation is at his second place, he can still try a few days to wait.
Spindler's hotels currently offer mostly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will still try to give up for a while, but then they will allow and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will quickly decline,” Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the Ingtours tour agency.
This is a Christmas week that has not yet been sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer remain free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in Krkonoších may still be offered by the top tour agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
Good for sale goes the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoších.
People are waiting to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountains without snow.
If the skies are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out,” Schiefert said.
On the contrary, a little better than last year, the rooms of the Horizon Hotel in Peci pod Sněžkou are well occupied.
We are about 5 percent better.
We have the last few places for Christmas and New Year.
A lot of interest is in the Polish holidays in January and in February it is well sold,” said Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel.
Of the eighty percent, the new year stay is also occupied by the Omnia hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázní.
On the other hand, for Christmas, half of the beds remain free in the newest Janskolázeň hotel.
This year, we were surprised by the January, which is now occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stay in Krkonoších will still rise, said Omnia Hotel Director Erik Sporysch.
However, for a greater snowfall, the hotel hosts have to let the taste go.
On Thursday it will be cold, if there will be some rainfall, so in the mountains there should be snow.
But then the warming has to come again, Jiří Jakubský from the Hradeck workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed.
United States: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It’s just comic, with what school effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the foolest.
When he finally swallowed out his desirably expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the word "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate even to use the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own Declaration: "New way forward."
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military strengths to Iraq suffering by the Civil War as “unresponsible and consequently catastrophic decision.”
But the subsequent months showed that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of the field leaders was the only possible and so successful that it was not spoken at all today in the news sessions about Iraq.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by the field commander, in particular the top commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordination habits, hardly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation to a better way.
The president hesitated for three months, but he did not seem to be better, and thus at least scammed the general for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he was able to remove the promise of another 5,000, although he himself initially counted at least 10.
The most problematic on the whole of Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to start the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan already in 18 months and to end this process in three years.
Many doubt that the half increase will give the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherhood wars of the last years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are observed.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces are badly preparing, used to change the master every day according to how they are suitable.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a potemkin village, for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to build.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex due to the unclear circumstances that make Pakistan and Iran’s influence even more complicated.
Even the construction of a "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem too realistic.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is fascinated by its volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has just worsened and is now on the edge of an explosion.
Believe in the fact that soldiers sent into the war wrath in order to "the quick return home" will cause the miracle done here, can only the soul truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of the troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect confession of the U.S. defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting operations in Afghanistan has gone to the bottom.
European politicians don’t know and don’t want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the suburbs of Hindukush.
Another factor that can radically interfere with the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation will continue to worsen and the strengthened sanctions on Iran will not result, the U.S. will raise a heavy question whether it will not try to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered just in the time when Obama says the United States will move towards a victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic shift in the situation in Afghanistan.
The only plot for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election, and therefore there is enough time for him to come with another strategy if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive cash rewards
Goldman Sachs will not be rewarded in cash this year.
This was by the company, which responded to the sharp criticism of its salary practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive a share instead of money, which will be possible to sell not earlier than in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn to the managers if they are taking excessive risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is on the forefront of a long-term performance effort to combine the rewards on Wall Street.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to go, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become a target of criticism after the first three quarters of this year gave its side $17 billion (approximately $300 billion) on rewards.
The company’s total remuneration for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite today announced measures.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political topic in a number of countries with the arrival of the financial crisis.
The UK on Wednesday announced that it intends bankers’ bonuses exceeding £25,000 (approximately £712,000) to once charge 50 percent taxes.
France is taking similar steps.
Women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields except for physics.
The record five women received this year’s Nobel Prize in literature and professional categories from the hands of Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf.
In addition to four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their cousin Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
The Prize for Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli woman Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for the clarification of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The last winner was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which was awarded to the American Elinor Ostrom and her cousin Oliver Williamson for the analysis of economic management.
The only professional category that went through this year without the holders was physics.
The prize was awarded by Charles Kao for the research in the field of optical fiber and George Smith and Willard Boyl for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical telescopes.
Each winner received a diploma, a Nobel Medal and a financial reward certificate.
That for each category reaches 10 million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more awards in each of them, the reward is shared with each other.
The most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded by US President Barack Obama in Oslo.
In his speech he recognised the controversy of his appreciation, because he is just at the beginning of his path and, in addition, he is the leader of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to win peace, although the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation.Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will take on Friday morning the finance minister Eduard Janot, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for the next year as approved by the House on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and Janotovo's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is criticized by Klaus.
He said that the deficit is too high, which further deepens the public financial crisis.
The meeting was by the President’s spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion SEK.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved the proposals of the Left to move money and increase the money to public employees’ wages, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government appealed to the proposals of social democracy that they secretly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a sharp internal political dispute, which leads to a question of Fischer's official cabinet, which was formed in the spring by the ODS, the CSSD and the Party of the Greens.
The critics argue that the budget, as it was adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of savings that Fischer’s government implemented in the autumn and which, according to it, is intended to stop the government’s debt.
Klaus, who the state budget law can, but also doesn’t have to sign, on today’s debate breakfast with entrepreneurs stated that politicians for a long time neglected the “serious problem” which is the “unstable deficit” of public finances.
He says he has no better solution anymore.
The improvement could only be brought by a strong government, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should consider a further existence.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Nečas told CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Greens is obviously no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as "strong statements".
CSSD head Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánka with the words that scary is the budget deficit that the former Topolánkov government has prepared for this year and that will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the government announced the approval of the budget for the next year as a success.
People were also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Invincible will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories despite some criticism that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The untouched fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story is presented by Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by Mandela if he could play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role in it is Matt Damon.
I said to him, ‘When I play you, I will have access to you.
The twenty-year-old actor, who won the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the Milion Dollar Baby boxing environment, has already appeared, for example, the leader of the abolition movement, which eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in the Divine Evan, but only rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African citizen was sentenced to 27 years in prison for his active work for ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the unbeaten and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The picture is a true story about how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African ragby team captain François Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his people are still racial and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite ragby players who belong to a global scale among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually enter the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on the plate.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I would bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scene before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to stretch Mandel's hands.
I found that when I print your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I felt I know how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Françoise Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of ragby.
A great surprise for him was in the end when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I ringed the house bell, he opened me and the first thing I told François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the movie I look much bigger'.
Despite the clear differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real predlogues under the leadership of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Unbeaten received positive reviews and is also talking about the ambitions for the Oscars.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his reviews into the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of lightning over Norway dissolved: Russians tested a missile
Over Norway was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has only recently admitted that it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the start was again unsuccessful and the missile called the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the praise of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in missile tests did not have the appropriate effect on the success of test flights.
The bulva usually didn’t fly at all or was damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is already written as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn’t fly but lights
The 13th trial started normally.
At the end of the flight there was again a technical damage to the apparatus.
The engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time the "Bulava" launched from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which floated under the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the shot from a ship that is in motion and at the same time immersed.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a closer unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
Generals defend themselves this time and claim that it is not possible to speak clearly about failure.
The first two stages of the missile lasted, and the accident hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines were broken right in the first stage.
Although a single test start was not completed without a mistake, only six out of the 13 headquarters of the Ministry of Defense consider the failure.
Nearly 50 percent success, therefore, fills generals with optimism and so still claims that "Bulava" will once fly without problems and that it will even kidnapp up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51 year contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will again be presented in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holders will help in the need to his team CSKA Moscow and will appear in the Friday KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently CSKA President.
After Dennis Kuljaš was injured, we necessarily need another defense.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We just need to resolve some formal concerns, the AP agency quoted coach of the Moscow club Sergey Nemchinov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will involve only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, Germanov said.
Fetisov will be the oldest professional hockey player in Russia in the event of his return to the ice.
In the NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played the whole season for Hartford at the age of 11 and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Dresden of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold, seven world champions titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he collected successes in the NHL, where he twice lifted the head of the Stanley Cup in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai Cancelled Trade Unions, Cancelled All Expenses
Hyundai’s headquarters agreed with the trade unions to cancel all overtime.
Because of regular overtime, the trade unions announced a strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai’s spokesman Petr Vaněk.
The Board of Directors has agreed with the trade unions on a new meeting on Saturday.
We can’t resign from our production plan, this is essential, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with the fact that two exchanges would be made, Vaněk said.
Server Sevmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work on Saturday exchange offered a bonus of CZK 400.
It will be returned for the work Saturday, November 28.
The company has decided to change the way of motivating employees for the proposed overtime.
They either pay an extra fee for overtime or they can choose a replacement vacation on December 28, and thus extend Christmas holidays for a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday exchange will receive paid travel fees and lunch.
Since overtime was the most urgent and palpitant point in terms of the comments and complaints of trade unions, as well as the protesters, which last week lively stopped production, the leadership yesterday afternoon decided with immediate validity to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Workers were forced to work more than two hours each day after eight-hour exchange until last week.
After the agreement was signed, the trade unions will withdraw the strike emergency.
The next meeting between the automotive industry and trade unions is scheduled to take place on Friday.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the motorcycle was sharply sharply on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struggled due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged harassment.
The management opposed that overtime workers must do for compliance with the requirements for car supplies.
The trade unions in their Monday announcement of strike emergency also demanded no sanctions to be affected by workers who interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand the company to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of £5,000 this year.
Hyundai car manufacturer now employs 2,000 people.
The company launched its production in November last year.
By September this year it has produced approximately 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: A Substance That Takes Up ‘HIV’ Viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also takes on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases surpasses the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not act as strong as some already available medications.
AIDS cannot be cured.
However, patients can significantly extend the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the reproduction of HIV in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the reproduction of the virus has also resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which medications are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from VŠCHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalcarborans act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of HIV.
Metal-carborans are compounds of bor, hydrogen, carbon and kobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all today used drugs, and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘upgrade’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connection to viral protein.
Metal-carborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cave formed by the atoms of bor, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case by a kobalt.
Destroy and resistant viruses
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV-protease caused by the fragmentation of the HIV virus, mature infectious viral particles would not arise.
When we stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effect of this series of HIV protease substances has been tested in the test machine and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalcarborans on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as in clinically used medications, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the medications are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications so from metal-carborans makes interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS has launched a fight against Fisher, the one defends
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for the next year "terrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider another existence.
The ODS said the Prime Minister was strong.
They have time to analyze.
Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Party of the Greens no longer works.
The Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the parliament, which is about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrally different, Nečas pointed out.
The House on Wednesday approved the budget for 2010, but with leftist amendments for more than 12 billion SEK.
The parliament increased the wages for public workers, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government's excuse to the proposals of social democracy was that they secretly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to have a deficit of $163 billion.
The ODS before the vote left the hall, fulfilling the government's desire that the amended budget is less bad than the budget provisory.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of emptiness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten with leaving office if amendments were accepted, the situation could look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota ordered to the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering a further resignation.
This is due to the disappointment of the budget.
If Fischer votes for a further fight with the budget deficit, they don’t have anything to do in the government, according to Nečas, the candidates of the CSSD, who made the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that relate to illness, pensions, or the amendment of the law.
Topolánek: Nominated ODS Ministers Are Not Guilty
This is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek emphasized in a text report from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are in the deputy functions people reporting to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of fighting the level of public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct to rely on the left majority that is currently in the House."
He said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the citizens.
I didn’t think about it, and when it’s up to date, I’m going to deal with it,” Defense Minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House of Representatives, who was nominated by civil Democrats to the government.
Prime Minister Fischer went to Brussels for the meeting of the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS resigned.
Nečas also emphasized that the ODS would apparently vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House of Representatives if the Prime Minister would not expressly ask the citizen-democratic deputy to allow the adoption of the budget.
We don’t look like orphans, we’re not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS in the political talks on the budget did not weigh the absence of the chairman of the party in the parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn’t notice that my voice was missing.
“When I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all the positive,” Topolánek said.
According to the new regulation, fewer trains will run for almost the same travel rate.
From December 13, the Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less loaded speedways and locals, other connections will, on the contrary, strengthen.
The total volume of transportation will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new schedule in force compared to today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer travel fees will not change.
More possibilities of connection to the capital will be obtained, for example, by the inhabitants of Ostrava, the trails to this trail will add one set of pendolino.
The speed stops driving to Bratislava.
Less speeds will also run on the trail Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, essentially the direct connection Prague - Letohrad will be limited.
From the regions, the trains plan the largest reduction of transport in the Královéhradecký kraj, a total of eight per cent, the increase can, on the contrary, enjoy Prague and the surrounding area.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several speed trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to just a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovic must move to Lysé nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko city system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the route from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
The Czech Republic will introduce several SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Šumperka/Jeseníku will go in two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer be connected with the Pendolin to Bratislava since December 13.
Regional Railway Account: 200 Million More
The Ministry of Transport has ordered and paid fasts, with a total of four billion crowns to be paid for the so-called proofable losses next year, like this year. the locals order countries, a total of eight billion crowns to be paid for them next year, with less than three billion crowns to be paid by the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
It has a new 10-year contract for locals and speeds, so far it has been a contract for one year.
The roads praise the system, and therefore they probably did not seek to increase the prices of the tremendous majority of tickets.
The changes will only occur in one-day network tickets and cheap online tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of Cd Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of the eLiska will be newly derived from the distance taken, so far it was unified for the journey between any district cities and was 160 crowns.
Philippines Armed Forces Arrest More than 50 People, Children Released
Armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was by AFP, which originally only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 armed forces are said to use the hostages as a living shield when they flee from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed part of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police originally persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded the processing of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a massacre that killed 57 people has been promoted.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the government election were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, the Philippines government resumed peace talks.
The story of Spring is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech is Invictus: Undeaded) is coming to the American cinemas, which captures a part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was made by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela had chosen for his appearance years ago.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaara, was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film in the cinema, it emerges from the opinions of critics and the public.
by Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded with de Klerk.
He was the President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
This is a big expectation, as it comes to the public in the time when the preparations for the World Cup in football are at the top in the South African Republic, but the media are shocked by annoying news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the population by the Black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reviews for the new film in the JAR are all positive for the moment, despite numerous reservations to the capture of the main roles by "proflak" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have been dreaming of this role for many years and I have been preparing for it well.
Many times I have also personally met Nelson Mandela to - as they say - absorb his energy, he said in an interview after the ceremonial premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can remind the film of Mandela’s personality and message.
It is the story of the South African Republic, but it concerns every person, he added.
The National Rugby Team
The film is based on the book subtitles of British writer John Carline with a freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave birth to a nation portraits a South African human rights defender during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman thus tries in the course of the film to stmel two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of people and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby dress on the field of the World Cup, which at that time JAR won.
For the entrance to the grass in the dress, which is understood almost as something sacred in the JAR, Mandela collected fourteen years ago great ovals mostly of the white audience and gained the recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to unite people again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tension situation in the spring will improve, it will only be revealed.
But the South African white people are skeptical, as an example was revealed in a recent interview for the LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformator burns for tens of millions of dollars
The fire was caught in the morning by the transformator of the company Cheps in the divide near the town of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to the spokesman of the Usteck district firefighters Lukáše Marvana, there are six units involved in the fire.
Initially, firefighters wanted to let the transformator burn out, but later the opinion was reviewed and the fire was burned with a mixture of water, pen and special fire materials.
The cause was a technical failure, the internal shortcut of the transformator.
No one was injured, the accident, according to the spokesman of the company Pavla Mandátová, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, precisely calculating it will succeed until the end of the fire.
The destroyed transformator will need to be replaced by a new.
In the course of ten years of the company’s operations, nothing similar has happened, the defects of this type are unique, she added.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, according to the CEZ spokesman for the northern Czech Republic, Soni Holinger Hendrych, the operation of households, offices or companies the fire of the traffic station did not affect.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, electrical pipelines 400 kV and 220 kV.
Itins, renews and develops 39 power plants with 67 transformers transmitting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and a route of 4,339 kilometers.
Janchura will submit a criminal notice for trial of three hejtmans from the CSSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will submit a criminal appeal for triple social-democratic hejtmans.
Michal Haška from the South Moravia Region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubic Region and hejtman of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Janchura said this in the Twenty Minutes of the RadioJournal.
The complaint is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term treaties with the Czech roads.
The three hejtmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are choosing roses, while we’ve brought an offer only to what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were closed last week.
We only have to defend ourselves.
It’s for a deception toward the Student Agency, he told RadioJournal Jančura.
He also said he has evidence from all regions that they did not take their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the submission of a criminal notice as a further continuation of Mr. Janchura’s media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertising by his companies and his own persons.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and the same challenge to the other hejtmans.
I expect that even at this occasion it will clearly show that it is Mr. Jančura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura has already announced last week that it is investing several million crowns in advertising that will alert about the unfavourable step of the districts.
He told RadioJournal that the campaign will be interrupted after Christmas and will continue after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech roads and did not sign the tender on an order of about 150 billion kronor.
According to Janchura, similar actions are illegal and contradict the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the railway transport in the districts, Jančur, according to him, threatened a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we don’t let it, we could lose the bus license.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know what he is about, his name I will not say, said today to RadioJournal Jančura.
Pneumococcus vaccines are free and non-obligatory.
Vaccination against pneumococcus since January breaks the experienced habit.
It should be first for families free and at the same time non-obligatory.
There is no doubt that compulsory vaccines are more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcus vaccine are top.
The medical institution has already set the maximum prices of vaccines that will be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are already clear in the process of vaccination.
New vaccines
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on August 2 and later may be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not received a single dose of vaccination yet.
Whoever started vaccination last year or earlier, must pay for another re-vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of the child's age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
The parents paid $1,600 for one dose and more.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are needed.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand kronor per year on vaccinations.
It will save on the treatment that children without vaccination would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 dollars per year for all large-scale children’s vaccines.
The vaccine was introduced by the so-called Janotov Package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain blan and blood poisoning.
A total of 28 children under 10 years of age will die from pneumococcus in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced a paid platform vaccination for children against pneumococcus in approximately 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
However, there is no doubt that this vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
It is expected to be paid by insurance companies and non-obligatory.
That obligatory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the civil association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsky suggested.
His association of pneumococcus vaccine has long been promoting.
Experts at the international conference that our association attended were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It is not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccine procedure.
We don’t think about it at this point at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say
Hana Cabrnoch, Chairman of the Specialist Society of Practical Children’s Doctors, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of re-vaccinations "For situations where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that this vaccination was initiated as voluntary," Cabrnoch says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to get their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is a breakthrough even in the fact that it is the first plain vaccination for children paid by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thereby saving on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the medication themselves.
But this is related to the concerns of practical pediatrists that relate to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them substances for other vaccines.
Some members of the parliament, however, feared that the insurance companies could “take out the money from health insurance.”
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical pediatrists will invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a significant amount.
It will not be easy, Cabrnoch says.
The son of the American artist 'stolen in a museum'
The son of the renowned American fantasy creator Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
The police in Pennsylvania that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested when he carried 90 pictures into his vehicle and his car.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used the bagr to the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr Frazetta senior, 81 years old, was famous for the creation of the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, the news agency Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Mr. Frazetta Jr. could be motivated by prolonged family disputes.
Frazetta issued a younger, 52-year-old statement to the police that he did so on the instructions of his father, "to get to the museum in any possible way and move the paintings into the adjustable spaces," the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior denied the grant of any such permission, as the agency said.
Labourists Stop Planned Tax Increase
The ministers defended tax increases and expenditure cuts, in the preliminary budget report against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tory's "proofed" the opportunity to show that they are seriously thinking of delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until the time after the election.
The chancellor was also shot down because of the disabilities of low and middle-income workers.
According to the proposal, it is mainly a 0.5% increase in social insurance and 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Disagreement with Social Insurance
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social insurance is rising – the growth is approximately £3 trillion a year – which irritated the community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax while it should be focused on the restoration of the economy.
This increase, limited to those revenue greater than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key Points PBR
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
Economic situation will worsen more than expected, 4.75% this year
50% of bankers’ bonuses
1% Increase in Companies Tax for Small Companies
Reduction of tax on electric vehicles and wind power plants
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the state financial administration estimates, some £30,000 revenue will be reduced by £90 a year and some £40,000 revenue will be reduced by £190 while some £10,000 revenue will be increased by £110.
The ministers said their goal to cut the deficit to half by 2013 means "complex decision making", but they insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of the highest-income people.
The finance minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increase and expenditure limitation would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would be needed to do.
“This will allow us to cut the deficit to half, which is an absolute basic requirement for the next four years,” the BBC said.
Mr. Timms said he is convinced that economic growth should occur at the end of the year.
But the preparation of forecast for future economic growth – which will affect the amount of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced – must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to review the previous amounts.
In the opinion he said, the economy decline was this year 4.75% - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - since loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
The Lost Chance
Conservatives, who launched a new promotional campaign on Thursday, warning of the labourist’s “duty crisis”, called the planned loan of £789 trillion over the next six years unbearable.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan, how it could be paid, they added, "cynically" delayed this decision until the time after the elections - which must take place until June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be possible," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so, but they lost it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourists insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike Tory’s proposals, who would want to reduce the deficit faster and in greater scale.
But Liberal Democrats argue that the money gained by increasing taxes and reducing expenditure should be used to support expenditure next year rather than to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on the sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said on the timing of the message - for example, the above inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits in April next - that it could lead to the accusation of the chancellor in the election campaign if the money would be hard to get back a year later.
But the Labourists insist on providing special aid if the people will very need it and the situation will be revised on September 2010.
Suspicious Budget
Although ministers did not publish the expenditure details after 2011, economists said it was clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be the beginning of medium-term restrictions.
Recognised Institute of Budget Studies said that the chancellor figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the future include transportation, higher education and defense.
“It’s really very painful for now,” said director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will only come after the elections if we win them," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to Deloitte's account reviror.
"This was the report of a suspicious preliminary budget. markets are implementing it."
FBI investigates 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a prison in Pakistan on five Americans suspected of linking to extremists.
The men were detained for the attack on a house in Sargoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the BBC the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it is investigating whether they were the same men who were declared missing in the last month in their residence in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are to be of origin in Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they stayed there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed about the arrest and was in contact with the families of missing students.
“We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are actually missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house that belongs to one of them's uncle.
It stated that the house was always the center of the interests of the local police and that the arrested men were not charged.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, but said the United States must "work much closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that advances in recruitment and training of persons."
The disappearance of these five students from their homes in northern Virginia was by their families at the end of November.
Amnesty for Iranian torture.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report describes in detail "the ways of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beat and burned with cigarettes.The other said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
The officials described this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens of them were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which led to the biggest street demolition since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were arrested and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death penalty.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now located in London, said that earlier in the protests the highest leader Ajjatolah Ali Chomejni declared the unlawfulness of some ways of torture and banned their conduct in the repair facility Karizak.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our writer said.
False Confession
Amnesty International quoted a report from a 26-year-old computer student, Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting against the election results.
“I’m often hit in my face,” he said in a statement.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened me with the execution and humiliated me.”
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the elections after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that the torture occurred.
Amnesty also the case of the former prisoner who said he was held in a container with other 75 people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and justice established committees to investigate elections and government reactions, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were published on the net.
The group said at least 90 people have been detained in the last three weeks to avoid further demonstrations.
A ski park was built in the city park.
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform Bristol's monument into a railway for the race.
The racing track for the park races attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial awards.
On the top of the riding trail in the Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge ahead of a 100 m long riding trail.
The fourth-year student of medicine John Hickman said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the riding track, but that it was really scary.
It was a wonderful view of the blinking lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talents,” he added.
The awards were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuver on the riding track.
After the Thursday evening race, the snow was left to break.
They and We
Can a Muslim be a French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in the world.
In a time when Swiss voters called for the ban of minarets and generally spread alarming reports about alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic wrote and informed and thought about whether Muslims can integrate - and whether they integrate - into one of the most open secular societies of the continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author's last work, "Why French people don't like shorts on the head" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of controversial issues that have divided and employed the country for 15 years and whose effects are felt still today.
Mr. Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the foundation.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that now take care of 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproduces the debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage union in a mosque or in the municipality (or in both places)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gay people?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system if they want to get a mortgage?
These are these seemingly worldly controversial issues that are being discussed and which are part of everyday life rather than political drama that employs the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others generally known persons, not excluding Tarik Ramadan, the Arab, a Muslim researcher and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen at the same time in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are unfaithful to the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed tend to assume that it is a counterpol of Selafi—the supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, united in Saudi Arabia—this group is small but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He asks himself how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so harshly defends the secular public) are truly devoted to the idea of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims are probably less experienced in religious matters than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromise with secular republicanism.
Instead of developing pragmatism, he found the “tracking of values.”
After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say “Yes, but not now.”
The most unpleasant prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the other environment of the planet.
The boundary ice drows with an alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as none else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural resources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On the thin ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, describes the natural history of the icon of the North, a polar bear.
Good acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whale fishing describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to capture the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson with a courageous fourteen-year-old swimmer who only fought with a mosquito is really a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their newly killed mothers were captured and sent to the zoo and circus.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared at once in one circus tent.
Climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.
After clicking you will find more!
Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunting from helicopters and Indians on skies and all are armed with powerful attack handbags by which they shoot their hunting.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, the former editor of the New Scientist, offers a clear and unpleasant responsibility of science for the Arctic and a fascinating lightweight look at how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.
This is because of the lack of tests.
Fridtjoff Nansen's research routes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how the floating ice is moving.
The Cold War submarines then maped the moving fronts when they submarined them.
Satellite exploration and extensive field sond in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many of them are still carried out thanks to unthinked individuals, camping in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the falling system, within the Arctic ice, created by the stretching of salt water, which smashes when it is frozen.
But from the top of the bear to the microscopic miracles inside, all of this is condemned to disappear as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place somehow between 2013 and 2050.
Within a few months, we can be.
More than 6,000 marine peasants put wings on the tombs in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, travelled seven hours by bus to put a simple vein on the grave of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other members of the Navy who took a journey from the Johnson Camp in Jacksonville in North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the tombs, it was a day in which a distant honour to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
Within a few months when we land, we may be we, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me so that he may show me respect as I try to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to put wings on the cemetery of veterans in several departments at the South Act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred tombs during the South Act in Arlington.
Now it’s a 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this journey every year and stops in different cities along the way to celebrate the memorial of the army members and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters are not looking for profits in that, wins across America, which they are also placing in other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 corners on the Arlington Cemetery, on the Pentagon Territory, on the tombs at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorable flight number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has spent more than $150,000 on the purchase and transport of wings.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she had undertaken a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said that it was her way to return what she is making a victim.
It is a small way the citizens can support our units, she said.
It’s like visiting a family tomb.
The volunteers passed through the cemetery through the surrounding trees and hills.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from the First and Second World War and from the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as new tombs
The mood was positive when the children were playing and holding their hands together when they transported the young borovic to the found tomb stones.
Each circular venus was dark green with a small red corner of the upper part.
Near the section 60, where the majority of war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, was still silent.
The associated services organizations dedicated 1,000 venues to decorate the department, but the cloudy mood of the wars that were ongoing filled this area.
Some were sincere, others prayed, and families and friends kept each other in the cold air.
Some read the names loudly, drawn into the stones, while others slept to look at the small black and white names, pressed into the wet blat where the tomb stones were not yet placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who washed their tears from their eyes before their son’s grave.
It spent eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the place of the last rest of the army artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, said.
"Al I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him."
US government supplier detained by Cuban government officials
The Cuba government has arrested a U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops to the country, the Foreign Ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, has worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the American Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Department of Interest in Havana, sought access to the detained, who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain accusations have not been published, but according to the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is called “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical stands, pose the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered to be serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are watched and disturbed by government agents.
Mr. Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country in order to receive the prizes, but the permission has been rejected.
The detention of a US supplier may be the result of increasing tensions between the Communist Brother Castor, ruling on Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was seen as a "stay tactics" in improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more space for opposition, the United States will take mutual steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and searched goods in a country where the average wage of a public employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has given ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used by sending text messages, because a 15-minute telephone call would cost more than one daily wage.
The use of the internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cuban citizens who often want to register must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of a Americans in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in a prison in Cuba are jailed for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, a press official of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
Prisoning and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities that would be legal in any other open society – let’s say free mobile phones – are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group program, who recently published a negative release on Liberty in Cuba, called “New Castro, the same Cuba,” as a clue to the installation of Raula Castra as the leader of the country and a replacement for the churavic older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the accused are often arrested, judged and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are pursuing a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials have revealed a conspiracy about sending men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed the alleged leader of a conspiracy about sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, and said they hope that the case could help dismantle an extensive network of terrorist verbs that tracks on the internet and searches for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a gray rebellion, known as Saifulah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifillah took the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to the remote area of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is the home of al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official, who the incident, said on Saturday that Saifullah failed to condemn al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA attempt to infiltrate a terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for a few days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the terrible mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
The reason why they were displaced was stated by the official, who talked about keeping anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission for access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law.
The case of this five – which remained in Pakistan and was interrogated by the FBI – emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and, much more importantly, determining who is reliable.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
Employers of the organization act as guards, removing those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the Holy War and those who could be intelligence.
Fake American recruits were subjected to a special investigation at al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, an elderly analyst at the U.S. NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years in how they will allow them to access because U.S. intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruitment methods.
If we try to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been so much followed? said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Thousands protest in Copenhagen for climate action
Thousands of protesters marched in the streets on Saturday and demanded a stronger climate action from negotiators in the city’s Bella Congress Center.
The protesters the number of hundreds of thousands of participants, but the police said the number was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a few masked activists placed a few small loads near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day that a small event occurred in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried transparents with the English inscriptions "This is not the planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish that "The Earth says 'tough."
A number of celebrities took part in the demonstration, including Danish model and photographer Helen Christensen, who said she had travelled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information about the unpleasant state of the country involved in the influence of climate change, which is still happening.
This is partly why we decided to join this great march—to pass through the world and appeal to the world’s leading personalities to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to do it, it is not always possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from approaching the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people, primarily because they had the masks or had a pocket knife.
These activities are prohibited under the Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the uninterested spectators, who doesn’t want to be identified because he’s involved in climate talks, activists masked as athletes and in black clothes placed several loads near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated near the buildings, he said, they started with lights, but then followed "a few big explosions."
Inside the congress center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn’t get into the mind of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international talks, he answered in English, "Actually, that is something I was not aware of" (in fact, it is something I don't realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
It is seen the concentration of the general public and the various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the freedom of action or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial differences
The federal certificate of last week on the achieved knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of the good news about the public education district of Columbia.
Although the district is far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth-class students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Certification Center for Teaching Progress are persistent differences in the knowledge achieved between African-Americans and white students, both on the side of local and on the side of national.
The average result of white students of the fourth class of the District of Columbia in the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (of possible 500), but their African-American fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow fellow
The difference in knowledge achieved actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress among African Americans in the eighth class remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of statistically meaningless one point from 245 to 245.
The average result for white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the horizon of six years is not just encouraging.
The difference between white and black students of the fourth class in 2003, when the first NAEP was performed in the district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Although the achieved result in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some educational defenders in the district said in the last week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were widerly stimulated in white students where there were already high results.
This would indicate that we have increased the total support of those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equal employment in the district.
I don’t jump up and down because of the gap of two or three points, said D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), a member of the committee, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the primary school in Eaton.
Frequently criticizing Mrs. Rhee’s management style, Mrs. Brown said that reporting the test results means high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It is obvious that you always want to see the benefits and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we didn’t spend almost any time and energy needed to spend on our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said that the district’s effort is to continue looking for better ways focused on the needs of students with low results.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new curriculum reading, Wilson's reading system, focused on high school students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their wing career significantly behind their counterparts.
The daily mathematics and the sixth-class mathematics teaching curriculum, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that have come to the district under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the brink of NAEP progress, which was last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions with those students who remain below the class level, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others said that the NAEP results clarified the question whether Mrs. Rhee could continue to boost the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
This is a certain winning dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where he studies the results of the tests in urban areas.
The conventional correction procedure is to focus the funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the district of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political calls that are against the important agenda.
But the excuse, of course, belongs to the other city directors who are trying to maintain the middle range between the white and the black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to strengthen the relativity of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can trust that their children will be provided with excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now Director of Schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element to reduce the difference between achieved results is the prolongation of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to realize the qualification of schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to be able to implement the changes, Mr. Janey said, who signed a contract with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers as a "signal" for looking for a greater increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg Railway with a loud rest.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came up and rested for a moment on white columns, stone facades and smaragd green grasses.
Gracielini parents hardly graduated from college in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the ground of the college.
Now she and other eighth-class students in the group explored Gettysburg, where school fees were $38690 a year, their position was rather than scared visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! that’s that! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Men, really? they said thoughtfully when they told them the low ratio of teachers to students.
The Pennsylvania Course was one of the seven who visited on their three-day tour and now were completely fascinated by the future news: the question is not whether you enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a big problem with the high number of children born in the U.S. of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from college or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "double generation" of Spanish students from college - remarkable achieved results indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and the inhabitants of Central America, arrived in the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, as it emphasizes their point of way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the field of the labour force of the country.
Those who achieved achieved higher education say they had a natural inclination to school and inherent passivity and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to graduate - especially if these efforts continue over time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and the ability to help them orient in the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve it, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area.
We need to think about providing these children with a catch network in the preschool age in all ways to pass through college.
The federal program, which financed the Graciela tour on the roads, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch curriculum preparation programs that start for students from low-income groups at high school and continue until these students finish college.
Since 1999, this program has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than % have entered college, according to the U.S. Department of Education data.
Iraqi oil industry ministry reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to force major oil companies to rebuild their untouched infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, damaged by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies have gone with capital shares on just two out of 10 outright fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for their participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
Only one presented a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached a deal on the field that was auctioned in June.
The sharp participation of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and instead of American companies here you have first on the way of the Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It will be a long time before something else will be sold in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. army, are likely to distract U.S. companies from a much more intense business in Iraq, which has provedly the third largest raw materials reserves, analysts say.
U.S. companies were in a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more susceptible to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies that signed agreements with the ministry.
American leading companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who haveined close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and offered technical assistance in the past years, have left with empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were allocated at the end of this week.
The state Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China strives to become a major economic and technological force, oil industry ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were temporarily selected to submit offers, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening output above the current level in each field.
Al-Qaeda planners were killed in Pakistan.
In the U.S. missile attack on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, the top al-Qaeda operations planner was apparently killed, the U.S. anti-terrorist department officials said on Friday.
As it was confirmed, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the top leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several missiles crashed on their car near the city of Miran Sáh in the province of Northern Vaziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have that the missiles have been launched from a plane without a crew of the CIA operating in the zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were indicated on a white car that was headed to the Afghan border when it was hit, a official said along with the Pakistani cyclic intelligence agency, who called from Miran Shah.
The official said the local armed forces came to the point and quickly captured what was left of "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. officials of the anti-terrorist department quoted an unidentified witness who said that Somalia was after death.
Somalia was listed as a high-level planer of al-Qaeda military operations, which led the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the establishment around the world, a senior official who did not want to be appointed said the sensitive nature of the U.S. air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda’s top leadership and on the basis of them he planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-level leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September when in a similar attack was killed Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the indigenous tribes and three other top poperative leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aircraft has decreased from the summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to records of the newspaper Long War, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be justified by improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also harmlessly killing people who were suspected of being informants, the site said.
The United Nations top delegate in Kabul resigned.
U.N. top delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would want to resign from office in March to end the stormy term of office, which was melted by accusations of extensive corruption in the U.N. supported president election in Afghanistan.
Eide's departure is happening because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the growth, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for the reduction of the state, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO countries to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghan people that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pushed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil workers helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but that he simply fulfill the promise he gave to his family in March 2008, that he will only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to submit a report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now said he would need time to find compensation.
As I said, it’s time to look at the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for compensation.
Officials said there is a choice between Staffan di Mistura, who has a Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guehennem, the French who previously led the UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential elections for masking the presence of massive election machinery.
Eide denied these claims, but said that the accusations of Galgraith -- who was released -- "surely damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism regarding international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the high representative of citizens to coordinate the relief efforts in the U.S. leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to borrow them for the Afghan mission, because he would, as he says, want to strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment over the limitation of his efforts in Afghanistan and said that the difficult UN hiring regulations undermine its ability to exploit its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get from May only one person, he said.
It’s a disaster and I can’t continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world’s powers will soon impose “a further significant sanctions” on Iran due to the lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a weekly journey around the areas where war is ongoing in Afghanistan and Iraq, undermined the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likely development.
One thing that depends on me is whether I’ve learned about something from Iraq over the past six years, [this] is an irrevocable unpredictability in the war.
Obama’s administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could interfere with the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and obstacles" would require "to force the Iranian government to truly feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "this inhabitants will suffer extremely" sanctions.
According to a Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will have serious consequences unless its nuclear program is fully consistent with the United Nations Committee on Nuclear Safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peace purposes.
In the talks in Geneva on October 1, he suggested he wants to return to the talks on the limitation of his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his uranium enriched reserves in exchange for the urgent necessary fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has set up for such an agreement as a way to establish confidence between the two parties and to get time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is withdrawing from the provisional agreements - partly therefore, the expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided in opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, when it comes to Iran’s harshness toward the international community in the case of some of the proposals he actually agreed with at the beginning of October, I think that brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline to 31 December for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to search for other elections including monitoring, what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission at the UN on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and said it wants to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "for achieving a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he departed to the oil-rich Kurdistan area to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions continue between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, especially due to borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to avoid the delay of U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. soldiers from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates when he told Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the united Iraq.
We don’t want to leave you.”
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which they read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One child in addition means one tomb in addition."
Then they got the lesson that when the official government positions in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the ageing population in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We’ve always spent all our time and energy on one child.
We didn’t leave anything for others, says Wang, 31 years old, a human resource manager who has a 8-month son.
More than 30 years of China’s policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations of only notoriously bullying and shy children, affectedly referred to as “small emperors”, the country is threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy came into force, according to the UN data.
Population division, where the number of people aged 60 years and older is forecast to stormfully increase from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050.
The imbalance is the greater rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning said, many couples have to have children to “help to reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of workforce in the future.”
He says it’s about “to be old doesn’t mean to be rich—as in developed countries like Japan or Sweden.”
Progressive calming
As inserted into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate established during the Communist Party’s government.
The couples who violated the policy faced extreme fines — up to three times their annual salary in some areas — and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials promoted a policy that helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were convicted of promoting the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortion with their second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexistic abortions, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their opinion about the one-child policy.
By the rule of law, in 2004 they allowed exceptions – including towns, national minorities and cases where men and women were single – and in 2007 they relieved the diction of their motto, promoting a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government officials had previously discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was single.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage multiple births.
Almost overnight, posters encouraging parents to have only one child were replaced with copies of the regulation, describing in detail how it would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet the couples in their homes and put the leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
Sorrowing response
Although officials in one rural city near Shanghai saw an increase in interest in couples who wanted to have a second child after the campaign began, most urban districts did not report any changes.
For example, the city district of Huinan with a population of 115000, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, the chairman of the family planning committee in the Shanghai district of Caolu said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said they would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docial catch network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West judge one child's policy wrong as a controversial legal question, says Yang, a building engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in bond with the first child.
We had a chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples point out the psychological reasons of hesitation.
Wang, the human resource manager, says they want only one child because she was also a single child: "We were the center of our families and everyone cared for us.
We were not used to provide care and in fact we didn’t want to worry about others.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who plays a translation company, expressed it much more uncovered.
For two-career parents from the middle class who have reduced birth rate, he said, to be successful means to be selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-old adults look at their parents as on the ongoing first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want this way to feed for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on the time of the parents, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions of the gap -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You have to have the summary ready at the time when the child is 9 months old for good pre-school education.
Most of his friends want to be happy with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don’t want to bring too many victims.
The UN has drawn up a plan to reduce emissions.
The United Nations-sponsored climate conference – characterized by far-reaching unprecedented attitudes and mutual orientation – again on Friday focused on the release of a document proposing ambitious reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations, which will bear most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final policy agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, emphasizes the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was an important progress in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who will come to Copenhagen next week.
Established by the United Nations ad hoc working group, this text insignificantly indicates how much money wealthy countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of global temperature rise that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This provides the process with a large dose of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Washington Sierra club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, a 180-page text of the talks to focus on what the UN top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It sets the circumstances for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions within a year to 25 to 45 percent compared to the 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country would reduce its emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union on Friday promised to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to climate change—from flood and drought to the prevention of deforestation.
But on Friday, he said the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in the talks last week.
The U.S. Special Ambassador to Climate Affairs Todd Stern rejected the speech, calling for a binding limitation of greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared to volunteering in major developing economies, unless they were funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration set a harder line against China the Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not enter the agreement without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "agricultural reason" or "extreme irresponsibility" led earlier this week to a message that the United States would not finance China to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic trails of the world’s major powers in betting, the crossing broke out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and the developing economies.
The current struggle is mainly ongoing for the preservation of individual economies rather than for the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States for the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while the poorest nations point to the fact that two dozen of the most influential countries of the world ignore the scientific imperative for the implementation of stronger actions.
Ricardo Ulate, Costa Rica's delegate, said it's not surprising that major powers are struggling for who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in looking for a way to prevent big emitters from being responsible in their actions.
It is clearly a game about the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have suggested that they would like to continue pursuing the legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but the majority of the main participants said that the best result of the talks will be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, formed a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate talks in favour of the European Commission, said that the prosecution by the small island nations "has caused a political push on the whole Polyrtic process" in part because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The talks caused a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that they have to solve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of governments struggle for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Rameš and Chinese Deputy Minister, came out of the aircraft and went through the Bella Center halls to the closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could draw out claims that will be assessed next week.
The entirety of the assembly—when 13,000 people moved daily from and to the congress center, guitar-playing activists showed in the night ironic views of the countries they thought they had sent them, and the submissions were hand in hand on paper rather than by e-mail—controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is just a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of states.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said Deputy Minister for Global Policy at International Nature Conservation.
Heavy weights come.
The first British train with a speed of 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday feelings
at 5:13 on Monday morning the star cut the darkness on a sign of the departure of the train, which meant the traffic revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and will fly from Ashford in Kent to St Pancras in London and overcome a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, transport minister, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed passenger set outside Lndyn.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect large agglomerations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Forgotten standing waters should be shortened traffic times in passenger transport and on commercial roads and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road constipation.
Theoretically, three major political parties were allowed to gain for this vision.
But dozens of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental disturbances have now removed the construction of British high-speed trains.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a conducible study, passed its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route to connect London with the western Midland was designed within five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods, where it could be problematic to reach the life centre.
In the open landscape, the final route was planned within 25 m.
HS2 also predicts to set three options for a large high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is the configuration of the form of the letter Y, where one high-speed track should lead to the western Midland.
The trail should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One route will lead to Scotland.
“It seems that the most powerful choice has been made,” said the railway expert.
Once it is done, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be shortened to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to run at a speed of 2,250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is already designed to catch 400 m long trains that would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal will be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if necessary.
Due to capital limitations, the existing stations are expected to expand to capture a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such a potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not take place before the general elections.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built on parts.
The trains should first be put into operation not on high-speed trains, but on already existing trains north of Birmingham and keep the driving times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a crucial contact point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, an orientation point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers paid a mortgage of £75,000 to the Orange Tory
Alan Duncan, the owner of the Tory's front seat in the House of Representatives, was paid by taxpayers thousands of pounds of expenses last year for the orange that he built in his house in the electoral district.
A party spokesman for prisons, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the parliamentarians lived "from payments", raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build a dumb-covered extension in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The public authorities approved the claims in time and so was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Leggem who carried out the control of membership spending. Last night Mr. Duncan expressed his claims "this could be cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his electoral districts Rutland and Melton.
Houses are worth approximately a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the financial office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is in plans labeled as "Orange".
Neighbors describe it as a "creme for entertainment and accommodation".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation on the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last settlement of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupil insurance to a mortgage of £27,1406 from his London property to a house in his electoral district, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 a month in the interest of mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds per month.
The interest in the RBS mortgage repayments of Mr. Duncan could not change at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to fund a loan of £75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment dropped in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, with which it remained.
The latest document of the municipalities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim £1250 per month this year in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as the shadow leader of the House in September after one secret reporter filmed him and said that the members of the parliament must survive "on part" after the expenditure scandal.
"In principle, it is nationalized, you have to live on the part and treats you as s**t."
He said, "I lost money for my garden and claim and a small piece of what was needed.
And I could claim all that wicked share, but I won’t do it.”
The deputy, a millionaire from his former career as a oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May, when it turned out that he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before approval by the financial authority that it "can be considered excessive."
One of the activists grew a pound-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan's grass to protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was due to the capital increase, which was approved by both the Financial Authority and later Leggem."
He added: "This is not a controversial question of hiding and clinging or violating the rules or something else.
It’s absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, legitimate and that’s all.
This could not be cleaner or simpler in many other ways.”
Come all carefully to look at the chateau on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
The coastal chats in Brighton have found a new meaning of life in the upcoming months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the Duke's experience of creativity has called on 24 owners to decorate their houses for every day in December, and to use Christmas colets as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were able to visit the last chateau from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with bishop's bread and swallowed wine, provided for free.
The châteaux included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the château represented the work of Janetty Tozer, the local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a priester without a scholarship in the Chicester Diocese and the leader of Beyonce.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
“Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building?I feel that the church should come to the people and serve in a awakening way.
“The idea of the advent calendar in the chats emerged just as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and pulsing place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday, calling for a strong and binding deal to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources, and one hundred thousand according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN Climate Conference, which aims to adopt a deal that could enter into force on Friday, January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairman of the climate conference, said the growing global mobilization, whose clear evidence is the current demonstrations, has contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP, the incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the march began, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began to break the outlets with plates and stickers.
The police immediately attacked strongly.
In total, the police the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", the ultra-radical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without a difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in the pursuit and in the seat "holded in the streets even on Saturday evening " despite the extreme winter.
After leaving the Parliament, the march went calmly toward the Bella Center, where the talks were ongoing.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For the speakers, a podium was built, before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities and, in addition to Africans, there was also a large number of participants from Asia, including a few Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, set up the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning on the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate."
Today we are going to the streets to demand the balance of ecological debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t say more: it’s time, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water streams are dry, today we can walk in them, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of struggle for another world approached ecological organizations.
French MP José Bové, one of the characters of the struggle for a different world, said he came to Copenhagen in order to "connect climate and social justice."
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are sensitive to climate warming.
According to organizers, around 50,000 people went out to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothes and shorts that evoked the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters went out to the streets calling for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protest organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Hundreds of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has chosen its president, Georgia condemns it as a "frog"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, approximately a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step a "frach".
About 13,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 on control over South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory, recognized by Russia.
The voting rooms were closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closure of the electoral rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merger with Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These elections are a crack.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "sorg that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian sovereignty," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said Kvarčija Světlan, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Baghdad.
She was one of those who came to vote in the election room in the school in the capital of Suchumi, in the beautiful white building with a few palms at the entrance.
The question of Russian sovereignty is the main topic of the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can be proud of its wonderful nature.
Over the whole of this small country with 216,000 inhabitants are placed huge billboards with Baghdad alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to monitor the successful course of the elections were warmly accepted by the district mayor Beslana Arshba.
“We, Abkhazians, are grateful,” he said at a small ceremony, having in mind Moscow’s support and especially its decision to recognize Abkhazian independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexey Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament and drank a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzhimbou and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the treaties concluded last year with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the railway network of Abkhazia for a period of 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba says he does not support neither the current government nor the opposition.
The victory in the election requires a 50% majority plus one vote.
If no one of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive match must be held within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people went out to the streets on Saturday, calling for a strong and binding deal to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police arrested about 700 people.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police sources and one hundred thousand according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which is hosted by delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving the Parliament, the march went calmly toward the Bella Center, where the talks were ongoing.

According to AFP, the incidents occurred shortly after the departure, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black clothes and armed with stones and stickers, began to break the outlets.
The police immediately surrounded them and attacked them without waiting, with several protesters crashing to the ground.
In total, the police the arrest of 600 to 700 people and stated that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", the ultra-radical separate groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late afternoon, a police officer on the neck was wounded and four cars were burned near the squat near the incidents, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, police sources said.
We’re focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters again flew into the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, set up the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning on the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate."

Oxfam has called several well-known figures, such as Danish model Helen Christensen or former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to talk to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are sensitive to climate warming.
According to organizers, around 50,000 people went out to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the city's capital Philippines, mostly students in red clothes and with shorts evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred protesters also met calling for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people participated in the protest organized by the 350 movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Hundreds of people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview for the JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "forced" within the framework of the reform of general high schools, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of high school with a focus on accurate sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all will be the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "there is a need to end with hypocrisy," because according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on accurate sciences" but "in essence, the best students are in it."
ES and L specialization cannot be for S some sub-specialization, he continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would make it difficult to not learn geography and history in the last year of professional high schools."
Ifop’s survey, which was published on Saturday in the Journal of Humanities, showed that seven of the ten (69%) French people disagree with the government’s project to abolish the mandatory teaching of history and geography in a graduate year with specialization S, and that’s why many intellectuals and teachers criticized this abolition, both the left and some right-wing parliamentarians.
The minister, on the contrary, added that "not comes into consideration" to abolish the philosophy in the program of specialization S graduate year.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in teachers’ education, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called on to participate in Tuesday’s mobilization against this project, which they believe is sacrificing the pedagogical education of future high school professors.
As part of the Master's degree 2 (M2) they will undergo at the beginning of the year an admission exam focused on their field and at the end of the year an additional test verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of the master's degree and in the first year they will appear before the students as a professor-internship.
If you count all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with students, 300 hours, continued .
The Minister also announced that he will propose a "personal right to education", which does not exist yet in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite university École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Five minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced in the summit morning by Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Development Experts (GIEC) on the initiative of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
According to one AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a kind of one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute expert contributions that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of which they would have a greater desire to learn something more, explained at the occasion of the conference 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after a fish from a local lake, which was named by students.
Around twenty contributing experts from each scientific discipline are selected and clarified that the selection is based on their charism.
About climate warming "we can talk hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel said to AFP, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he emphasized with the hope that the listeners will know that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific foundation."
The videos taken on these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and the next will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment Delays: Angry Supervisors in Prison, Planned Measures
The prison supervisors syndicates announced on Friday a "general mobilization" as they demand that premies and overtime be paid to them until Christmas holidays, the payment of which was delayed for financial reasons to January.
The prison FO (the second supervisory union) asked employees who would not have the service to take part in the demonstration held on Tuesday morning in front of the prison facilities, and to "block" them and warn them of "theft of their wages."
The CGT for prison supervisors (third trade unions of this sector) called on them to "call assemblies in individual prisons and start a major mobilization" with the fact that it is "dirty and unacceptable" so that "the overtime and fees for work at night, on Sunday and on holidays" worked in October, were not paid in December.
The first supervisory unions, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), “call to general mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and anger.”
The administrative department and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were included in the financial budget, but they ensure that the debt amounts will be paid in January.
The headquarters said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent a message to prison supervisors in which she assures that the payment will be made next month.
I know the efforts the prison staff is making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister writes in a statement.
I ordered the administrative headquarters of prisons to take immediate measures so that the situation arising from the poor assessment of the number of overtime will never be repeated in the future, Alliot-Mari added.
Thus, December wages will be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous awards for performing their functions and fulfilling their objectives, Ufap/Unsa said, and for those “there will always be a place in the budget.”
It’s just a scandal, the interregional union FO in Marseille was angry and announced its decision to boycott to revoke “all meetings and calls”.
Workers will not come to work on Sunday or on holidays, unless their payments for these days of the month of October will not be paid in December, as well as overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also threatened.
In a time when they give us more work and more tasks without giving us additional staff, it’s sad to allow the lowest-level employees to pay for it, CGT’s prison supervisors in Bordeaux report.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case the funds are little, stated UFP Secretary-General, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives “better gifts” than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, has entrusted the screen goddess Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
President and his wife Michelle talked in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening at the ABC station about how they are going to spend Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-foot companion of the family, gets his surrender.
“Jesus loves Boa,” Michelle Obama said, saying the dog will also get a gift, as the show’s preliminary broadcast shows.
And Michelle Obama also opposed her husband’s claim on the quality of the gifts she receives: “So it’s not, I gave you prima gifts last year,” she scammed the president.
Well, of course, it is true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately after that, with humor, he showed his finger on the pearl necklace of the first lady: "And who gave you this?".
During this one-hour very relaxed show with the famous moderator who hardly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the spouses also talked to Obama about their most unpleasant gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a round with a ten-degree switch, but also a basketball ball that his Kenyan father dedicated him to Christmas, which he only met very rarely.
I remember when I saw my father who came to see us on Christmas and how he gave me the basketball ball, the president told me.
So long after I realized that the ball was given to me.
The first lady again remembered the house for dolls.
I didn’t know how I had it all in the house to organize and so I fixed all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but that little house for dolls I loved, remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL says he is in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles because of the "ranties" arising after a larger operation he passed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while RTL said the singer is in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on Wednesday to Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "an injury resulting from an operation" of the cut plate, which he passed in Paris on November 26, his press department said in Paris, with the fact that these injury required "reparative operation".
The singer's press department, however, tried to calm the public and said the situation is "under control" and also announced that no later than 48 hours new medical communications will be issued.
According to the RTL station, which is the chief partner of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid “the pain and complications.”
Within 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we’ll be a little more sure, adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also that, according to "some sources", no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a cut plot.
The operation, which was planned a few days in advance, was performed by the neurochirurg Stephan Delajoux, a well-known physician in art circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny's close friend, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is just going through a "bad period", but added that he's "not worried" about the rock'n'roll because he's a big "battleman".
He called me just before the flight to Los Angeles, but I told him he did a fool because spending 12 hours in the plane after such an operation is not a fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, who said Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stop".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he didn't notice any special concerns.
The singer's health problems only multiply since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to surprise everyone, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated for a "small intestinal tumor" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems is highly monitored and commented. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulties with moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to dement the report of a new hospitalization again.
Euro-2009/Little Pool: Bousqueta's premiere in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Cup in the Big Pool, won on Thursday the title at the 2009 European Championship in the Small Pool in Istanbul in a discipline he loves: 50m free way.
On the first day of the championship, on which the dresses were last allowed, only three world records fell, although much more was expected.
One of them was overcome by Hungarian racing Evelyn Verraszt on the 200m positioning race and two remaining men's staff of Russia on the 4x50m positioning race.
This is a great sadness for Bousqueta, who has made a record on the 50m world record in a free way, which he already holds in the big pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m free way, won the 28-year-old French with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, on which the premiere started ten swimmers instead of ordinary eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Duje Draganja (20,70) and Russia Sergey Fesikov (20,84), but he failed to overcome the world record (20,30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is in my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane-made coatings, which will be banned from 1 January.
The combinations have contributed since February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the costume this time didn’t help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the big pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at the reach of the hand.
The young swimmer failed to overcome the record, holding 400 meters free (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Denmark Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn’t give everything to that race.
I knew that this time I won’t overcome the world record, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival for the future, Biedermann explained.
The album of the Roman sarcophagus belonging to Zol was sold for $1.5 million
The album of a romantic sarcophagus, which was not belonging to anyone other than the French writer Emile Zol, was sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, much more than was estimated, said Sotheby's art trader.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm high front plate, originating in the third century of our century, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionys scenes in a refined architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bakchants is a rare piece, similar pieces are very few in the world, four or five," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President of an auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the subject that is the most attributed to, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The album was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated the bath with her in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and the Council President shortly before Marshal Petain arrived in power.
It has been shadowed there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz discovered when searching for the Louvre Museum databases that the plate was part of the "resorts of the Emile Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
The attempt to withdraw President Zelayi from Honduras to Mexico has been interrupted.
Mexico said on Thursday that the conditions for the transport of the abolished president of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, was not met, and that the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After the telephone conversation that I had tonight with President Zelaya, everything for now indicates that there is no possibility to realize this transportation, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos said.
Mexican government aircraft, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelayu, flew back, a source from the General Directorate for Migration said.
The government of the coupists wanted to force President Zelay to "demission" and to seek political asylum abroad, only so would it give him the possibility of a safe departure.
But the rejected president rejected these demands because he wanted to leave Mexico as the exile head of the state.
The government of the coupists "visited another failure when they wanted me to give up my post (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he often spoke about the political crisis that has lasted in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the defeated president, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a couple of accords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Pushist government’s Interior Minister, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduras Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not apply for asylum to any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur station based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Honduras people.
News about the departure of Zelayi mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the defeated president who came to gather around the embassy in Brazil, where the army strengthened the protection.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the government’s position.
They demonstrate their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, was abducted on June 28, on the day he organized a public consultation in the framework of preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From the exile in Costa Rica, he suddenly returned on September 21 and found shelter at the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out there, he will be arrested and liable for the crime of "trade" he is accused of, the government says.
Putin's President Roberto Michelettim managed to organize presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelay.
In controversial elections, recognized by the United States, but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelay's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance drives to optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday with a rise and the results of the U.S. trade balance witnesses a rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.5% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegz from FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on “a half-filled glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on the figures of the U.S. trade balance, “which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit decreased in October by 7.6 percent compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected an increase in deficit.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
A big novelty is the growing volume of trade, especially the export of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the main business partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week increased unemployment against all expectations and the number of job seekers reached the numbers of 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller from Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also decreased.
The profit of the state treasury with a 10-year outlook increased to 3,482% compared to 3,423% on Tuesday evening and the 30-year outcome increased to 4,492% compared to 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime shouted "Women in White"
Hundreds of Cuban supporters on Thursday sparked the wives of political prisoners who gathered in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented a further demonstration on which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
Approximately forty "Dam in White", wives or close political prisoners were scattered directly on the street by Raula Castra's supporters during their march towards the center of the capital with a request for the release of political prisoners, the journalist.
Far from Yankees!, "Soldati!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" scandalized with a lifted arm the supporters of the regime on the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually accompanied by members of the civilians who came "to ensure security".
A day earlier there was a similar demonstration in Havana against "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Vedado district of Havana, the civilian police arrested about ten dissidents who were also planning to demonstrate on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, the journalist told AFP.
According to the reporter, the police charged the dissidents who were pulled out by the government’s supporters into civil vehicles using force.
Arresting dissidents in similar conditions takes, as a rule, only a few hours.
Winners of the 2005 Sacharov Prize of the European Parliament, "Ladies in the White" organized an unlawful march for "the release of all, according to the dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still in prison.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents “yellow soldiers” or “agents” paid by their head enemy, the United States.
Completed miracle, the Cuban television brought a report on the Thursday's demonstration of the supporters of the government regime against "the opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and the one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or U.S. NGOs of disrespect of human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A crazy man killed a 80-year-old man with a knife and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A crazy armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five more people in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during the summit on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in the pharmacy or before it, on 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of the police and witnesses.
Heavily injured old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police syndicate in the hospital on the consequences of injuries.
In this pharmacy or before it then the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband at the age of about thirty began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were taken to the same hospital where a 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," the police source said.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as a police source said, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard of Jean Jaurès.
He wounded two more people, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
It is unclear how it all happened, because it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two martyr knives, which he carried with the cross behind his back, said at the site the leader of the Alliance in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
A number of passengers, including young people, have, according to witnesses gathered by the AFP, tried to stop and disarm the crazy.
I saw a 30-year-old boy in a green jacket.
Three young people tried to catch him.
They failed, because he was pretty strong, commented on the situation Alberto, a servant from the nearby bar.
A crowd, including a police officer, who broke his arm, added.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to arrest an armed man and were injured by his legs, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The passengers told me that there was a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a seven-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place and noticed big wounds on the abdomen, said Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, the second about thirty-year-old person, who also had point wounds with a knife, arrived.
A man who had no identity documents was arrested by the police.
A prosecutor in Nanterre passed the case to the district police investigation department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He is in prison and awaits an investigation.
Police sources did not exclude his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it needed six police officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "total out of each other" as "all crazy of this type, whose strength increases in action ten times".
U.S. Lawyer Polanski Requires Criminal Prosecution
Polish-French director Romana Polanski's lawyer again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States) to stop the criminal proceedings against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence for a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the film director "Pianist" criticized before three judges of the second district of California's appeal court the serious mistakes that occurred during the court review at the time of the events in 1977.
I ask to stop the prosecution now and immediately, the lawyer Hummel said, adding that from the judge's behavior, who then decided in the case, Laurence Rittenbanda "he had a frozen back."
According to him, the judge (who has already died) had allegedly talked with a prosecutor before the judgment was sentenced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – a serious violation of the legal order.
The information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and sought), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually stated at the end of September that he "falked" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will request a court proceedings in which he will be able to submit evidence of his claims.
The prosecutor repeated what was already said in the first state, namely that there will be no serious examination of the request to stop the criminal proceedings until Roman Polanski is presented before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court sentenced in the case of "legal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
The Los Angeles Prosecutor’s Deputy, Phyllis Asayam, said that Roman Polanski “will be there to participate in the trial.”
We want in this case to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other accused that it is possible to escape? asks Ms. Asayam.
It is the opinion that the director "seeks charity from the court and at the same time neglect his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel's lawyer was not the only one to ask for the stop of Roman Polanski's criminal proceedings.
The victim's lawyer, Samanthy Geimer, also again asked for the termination of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client will no longer tolerate that eternal harassment every time the Polanski case arises, adding: "No one in this room can say that the process was fair."
Thirty-two years, that’s enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland.
After more than two months in prison, he was released to a house imprisonment in his Gstaad chalet, where he is waiting for a possible disclosure.
Wall Street ends without direction, the rise of the dollar brakes it
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market blows between indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and the rising price of the dollar: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological domination left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in the narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased considerably and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "help to improve the mood on the market in terms of stability of economic recovery," analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the U.S. retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, the trust of U.S. consumers also returned and strongly rose to 73.4 in December against 67.4 in the previous month.
Indexes, however, have been blocked by a new rise in the dollar price against the euro, which is the highest in the past two months, “drop down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
Technological actions thus lose the ground under their feet.
The securities market has declined.
The income of the state treasury with a 10-year outlook increased to 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year outlook increased to 4,497% against 4,492% a day earlier.
Miss World again in South Africa.
After a monthly trip across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are going to cross the target target to their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion TV viewers.
This big beauty celebration took place in Johannesburg for the second year and for now five candidates have progressed to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real show of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth,Durban or Cape Town.
I have seen a lot of things, and I have so many experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midland, north of Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15 hours world time).
I couldn’t dream of a more beautiful land in which I would put a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could experience it twice, said Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was brought in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "from breathing country".
After a month of performances, tests, press meetings and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indka Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participates in the elections, Aishwarye Rai, the 1994 winner, who both became the stars of Bollywood.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it’s not just about the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be carried in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and of course in swimming clothes.
The show will be presented by Chinese television moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of Beauty of South Africa Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee Chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown its ability to welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to deal with, said Miss World competition chairman Julia Morley.
The candidates, like last year, took part in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who struck their hands.
For the president unusual, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Without a doubt, the most beautiful remembrance will remain in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I didn’t even dream of.
I’m sure I’ll return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to David’s son, the reports of Hallyday’s state are “very positive.”
The news about Johnny Halliday’s state is “very positive,” as his son David told us when he arrived on Friday at the Los Angeles airport, where he arrived to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for a few days.
The news is very positive.
It’s very strong and everything goes very well, said David Hallyday when he left the plane, which he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 a.m. local time (21.m. world time)
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said he would get "as soon as possible" to the Los Angeles Cedars-Sinaï hospital, to which John Hallyday was taken on Monday due to a postoperative infection arising after a cut intervertebral plot operation, which he suffered on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, he was singing a night in Los Angeles for comfort "introduced to artificial sleep", which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate the treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles already put into artificial sleep. The hospitalization occurred due to an infection after a cut intervertebral plot operation carried out on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia took part in a school show of a French lyce in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which is attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology of the La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he will leave to the singer to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer hardly accused Dr. Stéphane Delayouxe, a neurochirurg who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They said it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles said they were angry, Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "goed too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally talked to the doctor by telephone and he assured me that this journey was not a problem, which surprised me considerably, as I myself had already twice suffered from the cutting of the intervertebral plate, he added.
A moment earlier on the radio station RTL, he said that the singer apparently flew after the Paris operation without drone, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the art circles.
He operated actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, on which he worked at that time.
In 2007, she also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourga to remove the hematom caused by a stroke in the brain.
He is, of course, a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
The lawyer of the Medical Chamber, Olivier Metzner, described him as a "man without scrupule", who is "regularly" called before the Medical Chamber, and who can't even "remote recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He said the procedure had a "completely good course" and the postoperative examination was "normal".
The operation was not of hemorrhagic nature, therefore the introduction of the drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have grown since this summer and in any case it seems that his next tour remains with a question.
It is obvious that the date for the renewal of the scheduled tour on January 8 (in Amiens, note. red.) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF is raising the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre to no longer take advantage of their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, on Friday responded to the attempt of the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervého Morina, to own the ex-Giscard party abbreviation with the fact that the abbreviation should not be used in any media under the threat of criminal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to own the UDF with the fact that François Bayra is not worthy of carrying her inheritance after giving his hand to the left.
The Defense Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Movement Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Hervé de Charetta (ex-UMP now for NC), who attributes ownership of the UDF brand as the first to register it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association committee led by friends of François Bayroua, who do not intend to let themselves be exempt, came out of their silence and submitted a formal request to the minister and the parliamentary to stop using the abbreviation and return the property of the trademark, under the threat of criminal proceedings.
In recent days, you have raised an alarming statement about proposing to your political movement + again take over + the UDF encryption, the Association writes in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez by MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis from Alliance Centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan+UDF today+, the signatory of the letter also stated.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF committee, which calls for the NC movement"to immediately remove all mention of the name of the UDF from all promotional materials including (their) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of the trademark to legitimate owners."
If you do not do so, we will address the courts to respect the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter they indicate that the UDF "is a full-right political movement since 1978" and remind that Mr. Morin and his friends " chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
Therefore, the Movement Nouveau centre has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they remind that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 for joining MoDem for three years and for the creation of a committee responsible for defending the "moral and material interests" association founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when it registered a trademark,"he was not "for three years a member of the UDF", but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he took advantage of the non-existing registration of acronyms to do so on his own account.
This inaccuracy begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then with irony express to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that, both in politics and in ordinary life, it is more valuable to create a name for itself than to get out of anonymity by fraudulent acceptance of a name that we have no right to."
Liliane Bettencourt's case: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of the state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and make a judgment whether he used the state of weakness of the eighty-year-old billionaire to prepare her for a portion of her wealth, which is blamed by her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
A photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of celebrity will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a criminal offence for which a maximum period of 3 years and a fine of €375,000 is imposed.
This decision confirms that the process will actually take place in a case, which can be referred to as a family saga of one of the wealthiest families in France, in which the mother and daughter attack each other and struggle for the management of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and main shareholder has always refused to undergo such an investigation, definitely not under the conditions offered by the Prosecutor's Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time make an opinion whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a weak state, and in which period.
I think he will undergo it.
The case will be discussed with her, said after the end of the hearing the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
As regards the lawyer François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the judgment of the court welcomed.
The expert will show that with this old lady, who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It’s two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter launched a criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artist accused of using her mother’s weakness for years to get a billion euro donation in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master’s paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to judge the legitimacy of the appeal submitted by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday's lawyer's speech changed to a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters that her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, expressing her unfaithfulness to her husband, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to a lawyer, adds, “You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once to twice a day.
“Since I was married, I have never been able to talk to François.”
The Nanterre State Prosecutor's Office again found that the action of the complainant was unjustified, moreover that the caregiver judge in these days rejected her request to initiate a proceedings to grant legal protection to her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is entirely capable of participating in the court, not under protection or in custody.
No one else will act for it,” the prosecutor’s representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney, said.
The court eventually decided that Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would make an opinion on the legitimacy at the time of the proceedings.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been unnecessary...
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees reminds the company’s approach to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about collaborators to identify with the “values” determined from the mountain, as it was before when consumers had to force the products that came from the ideas of the factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...even though autoritarian efforts to force products, different from customer preferences, are returning regularly!
The passive approach of employees can lead to lethal demoralization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which affects mostly managerial bodies.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and most importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, the EI “ requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to predict” and requires from employees commitments that are entirely contrary to the revenue of autoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a management revolution, which should be aimed at bringing employees to the center of the interests of the company as well as the customer.
Relative utility of internal opinion surveys.
Internal opinion surveys - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I am afraid that not.
Especially because I’ve already convinced myself that facing a new situation, the structure will return priority to what she has always done!
Furthermore, because authority, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because graduates of college are for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of the comfort of thought, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, now revived by the "neurosciences" of the United States and widespreadly spread without greater knowledge by the scientific institution and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the “pack” (sic) involvement of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos on Figaro.fr has shown that it only establishes the managers in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern implies the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating basic insight into all management plans and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will be possible only if they appear as a clear means to their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of motivation of employees is only dealt with by the study Motivated Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their on the basis of a predefined doxy that will enable them, through the image that it tells about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to their life goals.
With the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate on their “social performance” and put their human resources management “on the right path”.
This creates a nutritious ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In Oslo's speech: "A fair war" Obama earned praise from the right side.
The US right on Friday welcomed the speech that Barack Obama presented a day earlier in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of "fair war" against U.S. enemies.
Conservatives who first laughed on Obama's award on October 9, this time praised the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former vice-president candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what she said, said Palin, the right-wing Republican wing mouse, to the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself expressed herself in her memories on the topic of "sometimes necessary" war.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans would like to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be arrested.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified the shipping of forces and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Chairman of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech quite historical, Gingrich said during an interview with the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former deputy, who some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was excited to see the “left president” reminding members of the Nobel Prize committee that “they themselves would not be free and could not give the prize for peace if the use of forces did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, the former speech author George W. Bush, now the editor of the Washington Post, Obama presented "very American speech."
He not only presented himself as a “world citizen” as always, but he “speaked as a U.S. president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they do not do too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few unhappy ones from the rows of the right are the Bush's epoch, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as "unified, overwhelming and uninspected," as said on the website of National Review Online .
On the left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is scared when he looks at Barack Obama as he justifies the use of forces.
“When we pack the war into the package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the middle-left press holds a praiseful view to the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the Peace Prize to Obama as premature, he assessed his outcome as a "supergirl" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in the resolution of conflicts, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California Daily said.
Obama said the speech was "as needed," the New York Times said, and the speech was "for simple and instructive."
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of warehouses for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, trade unions of road carriers and TLF, the only employer organization that remained until the end, came to an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call to strike and the threat that hanged over the supply of reserve for Christmas.
The State Secretary for Transportation, Dominique Bussereau, during the Friday signing of the agreement expressed "rejoice" after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, negotiators split early on Friday morning, hoping that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
Three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the negotiations.
But it was needed more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 p.m., to all agree and at 18 p.m. to sign the agreement.
This conflict "will greatly hurt" and "will threaten the danger that holidays will be interrupted at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not a lot, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Today evening we will give our members the order not to occur blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few other opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "correct agreement", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high wages due to the international competition.
It will increase by 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and by 100 to 120 euros for the highest wages.
This is an agreement of good reason and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is a “acceptable compromise.”
The agreement also provides for a 3% revalorization of travel expenditure and a road traffic situation report in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focus on the issue of the 13th wage and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau reminded "a 100 million euro reduction in corporate wage taxes" which was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday night.
The government is asking the Senate for a "equal" vote.
The signature allows that this Agreement will apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, then to the whole industry, in the event of extension by the Ministry of Labor.
It will take place "in the shortest time possible," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only slow down the disagreement of the employer organizations.
The FNTR is talking about a "bad trade" since €100 million "was already offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to an emergency action not due to mutual analysis, but in order not to rage the crowns at the time of the coming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, it is threatened that the agreement in the next 12 months "make a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry."
Pre-city trains RER A: interruption of transport on the weekend, trade unions unhappy with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
Traffic interruption on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend as the Friday negotiations between the trade unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the questionnaire for a prize.
On Saturday and Sunday, that is, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, the trains will run only between 10 and 20 p.m., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will run each second train, outside this section only one train of four.
Connections to the SNCF will be interrupted in the Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette shops, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP has sought to ensure connections with big shops.”
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by the RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains were in operation in the top, and practically no set was running in the time outside the top as planned.
Just like Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the successors.
So early in the morning there were much less people at the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other things also because there were missing students and students.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he woke up "a hour and a half earlier to make sure he will arrive in time."
The Saint-Lazare station was not overfilled, the state railway station SNCF, forecasted a greater number of establishers and guards of order.
The RER A suburbs operated by SNCF in direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station with a metro connection.
The next general meeting of the strikeers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, on which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the leadership will be evaluated, which the trade unions have assessed as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for the RER A suburbs on all sides, working hours, career course, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand the deserved prize, according to Thierry Garona (Jih Board).
RATP even so far delayed the proposals regarding the premium, which worsened CGT with the fact that the leadership "was unable to solve the problem while travel companies and SNCF were able to do so."
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, “the conditions for the performance of the profession will be closer reviewed,” the transport companies RATP said.
That was the reason why trade unions think that the company “does the weekend passengers a joke.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the business committee in its headquarters in Paris.
The leadership, which so far refused any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in order to “calm”.
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independent announce a strike emergency.
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Independants (Independants)) and make it difficult for the worsening working conditions on this line, which transports a million passengers per day.
RER suburban train drivers earn 2200 to 2700 euros of gross wages and 600 to 650 euros of remuneration for irregular working hours and for work on Sunday and holidays.
The Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish party and this decision has severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday decided to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protest and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could significantly complicate the task of a government trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it has become "the nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its inseparable unity," Supreme Court chairman Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of talks.
The decision was unanimously adopted by 11 judges, where the dissolution of the party needed a majority of seven votes, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president Ahmet Turka and deputy Aysela Tuglukova have a ban to participate in political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity used by Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party’s property by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP Party has 21 seats (from 500) in Parliament.
The party’s leadership has already warned before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the Parliament than act in it as non-political parliamentarians.
The decision is a continuation of the 2007 prosecution initiated by the prosecutor of the cassation court, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the “orders” of the Working Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is a legal political vitrine of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s judgment comes when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit Kurdish support to the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a restoration of tensions in the southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations have been overwhelmed in recent weeks against the conditions under which the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the judgment, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeastern part, inhabited mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water rifles, demonstrators throw Molotov’s cocktails or shoot stones from the stairs.
About a hundred people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict was issued, Mr. Türk said that the judgment of justice would only “deep disappointment.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by the party’s ban, he said in the press.
The government, made up of a party emerging from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We are against the disruption of parties.
Nothing solves this, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete shot of the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for the reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK signed up to one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow can come.
That’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he would want to harass citizens, says the head of the winter department of FES technical services.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This may happen for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are prepared to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is going on according to a precise plan.
Once the snow is flourished in Frankfurt and the temperatures fall below zero, the so-called 20 sections and big-shipers will go out, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and passing tracks such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and decreasing sections like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at 3 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to sweat with a wet salt, which holds better, some about 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "to make the roads free until the transport to work begins."
It’s unfortunate when it starts snowing at 7:30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the chief of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make the seapers a place."
Only when there is so much snow is on the line of arrival and connectivity communications, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
Last priority are side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they’ll complain there.
At 5 a.m. the FES peasants will go out on the road, preferably cleaning the dangerous places and passes.
FES is usually not able to take care of all cycling routes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that follows from 22 to 4.30 mainly the bridges, says Brauburger.
Since the ice is rapidly formed on them, the sinkers go out immediately as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
The Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other meat-eating dinosaurs: An animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters high was running on two strong rear edges, had a long headache with sharp, stretched teeth, short front edges with serpent flies and a long edge.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine write that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characters.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was at the time in the equatorial dry area of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the previous evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about family relationships, expansion and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations in the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found dozens of dinosaurs bone, which is unseen for trias settlements, reports Randall Irmis team member from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, the remains were collected from a total of five individuals.
The findings confirm the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Indians Hopi.
For Sterling Nesbit, this is an unusual discovery: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the trias are very rare, mostly only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservations.
This finding is not sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts are discussing, for example, when the jars were divided into the three most important development lines: the meat-eating theropodies, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the "long-charging" four-nose sauropodies and their relatives, and the Ornithischia (bird-chargers), which included, for example, the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapist after the analysis of Nesbit and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the Tawa hallae headaches, researchers found evidence of air bags, which have the descendants of the theropods birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bone of the spine was obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of huge sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably created by the common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs were known to have lived in South America, scientists stated that there were the first gangs to appear.
According to this, three development lines were divided soon and spread from South America to all the continents, which at the time, as the supercontinent of Pangea, formed a single earth mass.
It would also talk about the fact that the team found together with Tawa hallae the remains of two other, not closely related teropods.
These three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of heavy dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn's paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could bring together a distorted picture, because in South America many primitive dinosaur fossils have remained preserved, while on other continents they are rarely found.
As the dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare side line of the plague to the ruling vertebrates on Earth during the Earth's Middle Ages, it remains a puzzle.
During the trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other plays, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and the flying jars and countless other jars.
Approximately at the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while relatives disappeared and the trias and jury interfaces.
The history of success did not last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
It could have occurred a mass extinction that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the plagiarism did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better so they could push the competition out.
The history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite collision helped another group of animals, which also evolved into a trias and since then lived in the shadow: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from University of Toronto, University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Doctors from Neapol, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police cleansing of the occupied casino at the University of Goethe in Frankfurt has taken care of a global shock.
278 professors and teachers at Goeth University, but also universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, the presidents "do not approve" the incentivated police intervention.
Because the walls and artworks were counted, University President Werner Müller-Estler laid out the building that was occupied last week by strike students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the matter, the signators judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command".
Cleaning represents an “unacceptable interference” in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “unlawfulness and criminalization of the protest” and distracts attention from the content.
The board avoided the necessary discussion.
The lecturers call on the stop of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the strikeers did not support material damage.
Legitimate Protest
Also the youth trade union Verdi and the German trade union solidarize with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of increasing concerns about its own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessen's minister of science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is currently defending the progress of the university president and the police.
I am grateful to the University President.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Actual Hour) in the Wiesbaden National Assembly.
We have understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, the MP for the CDU Peter Beuth said.
Otherwise, it was seen by the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke.
CDU takes the painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of addressing the arguments and demands of the students, there was a cleaning.
Linke submitted a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police involvement.
The Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, unavailable to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly watched site where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are important micro and nanoelectronic research and production centers.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Greenland have established contacts with the Riedberg Scientific Centre in Frankfurt – with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol on Near Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow mayor Yuri Rosljak and the Zelenograd prefect Anatolij Smirnov, for Frankfurt signed by the head of planning referent Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will attend a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ’s companies will be able to stick to the rising Russian market.
Russian research firms are seeking contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large Citronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation of "Green City") gained its name from the forested mountainous landscape in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 is not enough to be prepared.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply a "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than the launch of stations, more than a monstrous building that will throw the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade into a desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was founded in the spirit of the 1980s.
The main railway stations that ended in the center of the city were then considered the transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as the brakes of modern railway transport because it took enormous amount of time to cross locomotives backward forward.
Take, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
And therefore the main stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the passenger station, which lies approximately in the middle of the route of the transeuropean railway magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislav - therefore the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with the S21, although the 80-s vision is no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that the start of the construction in the Hessen and Bavarian majority is almost unfinanced.
Since there are modern railway trains with motor and driving vehicles on both sides, the main stations no longer have problems with riding and leaving.
Still: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulma.
It was made by local and local politicians.
The roads cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are carried by the taxpayer and not the state group.
The project can be apologized in some way.
A new urban space will emerge, which - when we trust the computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
The S21 is harmful to the railway transport system.
Transit stations and route construction are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - attributed an enormous increase.
There was no competition on cheap flights.
But the modern transport policy must go first and foremost to strengthen cargo transport, as rail transport is far more ecological than truck on the road.
But the new trail is not suitable for cargo trains due to sharp climbing.
Even more seriously, the S21 is indirectly touching a lot of other rail projects.
6 billion euros were to be buried in Sweden.
This is the official number.
Experts estimate that 10 to 15 billion are real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for further nodes and narrow spots in the network.
The Ministry of Transport has a list of 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the construction of an approximately 180 kilometers long route through the Rhin Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been running slowly.
It should be properly pressed.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Valley of Rhine will become the throat of the bottle of international cargo transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
Government investigates court judgment on the airport
The Land Government has opened in the Wiesbaden Land House whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) on the ban of night flights and let it be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally judge more than 400-page VGH judgment, the Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel today wrote that the state would have to amend the night flight prohibition in the event of the planned northwest ranway of the Frankfurt Airport.
The permit of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the country’s government predicts, does not comply with the law-ordered protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether to request a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and called on the representative of the government to give up the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises on the night flight ban she made before the election.
It’s devastating hard if you can follow your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir in reference to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We hold the word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbela's excuse, the country's government is trying to get to its night flights through "the breakthrough of law and tricks".
A precise legal control requires its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The statements of his faction on the ban of night flights have never been the same as the opposition says.
U.S. banks pay for aid
The U.S., the big banks shocked by the crisis, are getting rid of state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid a total of $45 billion (approximately €30 billion) aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund.
According to the U.S. news agency CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to pay back the state aid.
The constitutions thus want to get rid of the limitations that occurred with the receipt of money - the limitation of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has achieved $19 billion of net money from investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
The rest of the amount she took from her cash, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday evening expressed his gratitude to the U.S. taxpayer: Money injection helped us overcome the difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged itself at the peak of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations to the state also by obtaining money on the capital market.
CNBC, referring to the sources, that the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back the aid.
Fast choice
It went faster than expected.
The station presented the successor just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF pulled out of the office of chief editor Nicholas Brender.
Yesterday night, the grammy wanted to agree on that person.
The favorite was named Peter Frey, the head of the ZDF studio in the capital of Berlin.
But the court did not confirm it - officially, not to prevail the process.
But the role could also be that they did not want to hurt the ZDF intendant Markus Schächter, unless this proposal passed by the board of directors.
Frey, the Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the group.
The result of the vote was not known before the closing date of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a sad defeat for Schächter, though it could be expected.
The EU’s majority in the board of directors already signaled several weeks before the election that they don’t want to confirm Brender.
Resistance to the chief editor was organized by Hesse's Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected another stay in the office of the highly appreciated chief editor with the argument that the quotas for monitoring of the ZDF news broadcasts fell for Brender.
Until the time shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
For the last time, even 35 state lawyers were involved in the debate, who assessed Koch’s proceedings as unconstitutional.
It was nothing.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Politics, Pedagogy and Romanticism.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent chief editor; 1991/92 writer in Washington; to 1998 leader and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; to 2001 foreign policy leader of ZDF; since then leader of the chief study of ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the professional magazine Medium Magazine as the journalist of the year, was dismissed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional appeal.
Koch's counter-candidate in the board of directors, the Rhine-Falks Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that federal countries should change the state treaty with the ZDF so that the intendent's personal proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude political parties from the ZDF supervisory councils.
Brender's supposed successor Peter Frey ordered the board with a smart chess move - immediately after Brender's dismissal, he strongly criticized Grémium for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence he could be nominated for the post of chief editor without the loss of the face of both Schächter, so he could be elected by the board of directors without getting into suspicion that the party would be pushed into office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is not so ranked to the leftist liberals.
Study to Get Rid of Harampadi
Part success for students: After a year of strike, the Ministers of Culture finally entered the federal countries on Thursday: At the Conference of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors, both parties agreed that there is a will to improve the conditions of study for bachelor's and master's students.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of the exam: Basically, each study module should be completed with one single exam.
In addition, the student’s workload should be over-controled, and “real and defensive levels” should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
Federal countries are committed to creating more flexible joint structural tasks for bachelor's and master's studies.
Earth deviations should cease to exist.
Less testing
Since the start of student protests in the worm, the ministers of culture and university rectors had winged words in their mouth about better study.
This is the first time they are filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has decided that the number of exams is partially drastically reduced: "Every module will, as a rule, be completed with only one examination," the 30-page report, which is partially intended to re-regulate the approval of study disciplines, writes.
“A significantly lower test burden,” said the accreditation board chairman Reinhold Grimm, “will be stopped by the wrong development that significantly reduced the complexity of the study.”
To do this, the "excellence of study" in the future is to be a "defining criterion" in implementation.
Modules and content must be “hardly over-controled” to “do not unnecessarily restrict students in their choice”
of seminars.”
Students should "request for a space that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules shall apply when approving new studies, after review but also for existing studies.
These need to be “reaccredited” every five years – which, however, means that it will take until 2015, before all the fields of study will be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies across Germany are responsible for this, which are subject to the accreditation councils established by the federal countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the federal countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the filling of the curriculum was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In each federal country, universities and universities have already agreed with the country ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhine-Falco has promised additional funds for further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities should primarily pay for consultation programs and study counseling, and strengthen the test and foreign authorities.
The country and the universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit a reform to the parliament of the Higher Education Act.
According to it, only one exam should be required to complete the study module.
Forming the study should be even more flexible, to this should be guaranteed the recognition of examples from other universities and make it easier to have the master’s access.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all the fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition on Thursday again discussed the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to criticism, the resolution was also criticized.
The federal board of university groups Juso called for the formation of the education policy not to be played in the future "through the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, the students should "to speak at least a word" as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the Chairman of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the student experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman.
According to the Department of Education and Science (GEW), Bonn's resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree to access a master's degree.
Secondly, the federal countries must ensure that there will be enough places available tomorrow for the current generation of undergraduate students in the master's fields with the best possible study conditions, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The federal countries need to employ a lot more lecturers.
But the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves on the free access to the master's programs.
More than a note to Hertha Müller
“To get to Germany and out is nice, almost no control...” is the introductory line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, who in this striking linguistic piece thematizes the experience of the arrival of one dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one child book publishing, and in 1982 he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he taught poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he is the head of the Hessen Forum of Literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of a significant non-military shock on Tuesday at a seminar in Munich on “German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts.”
Obviously uncertain and infected Söllner left a statement in which he acknowledges to his collaboration as a secret informant before his colleagues Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
The attempts to survive were said to have begun inadvertently, first in 1971.
I’m, Söllner continued, “this is someone who didn’t prevent enough from attempts to intimidate by Securitate.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize award by Hertha Müller and her unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of the dictatorship government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shocked by the case that marks the depths and shame of a political system based on control and spicing.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the criminal, but is also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, the secret agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence on himself of the secret agent Walter.
“He’d cut me out at that time in all the points that are essential to him,” says Markel.
It has a moral duty to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in this form and in this audience unexpected, but completely surprising the admission of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not.
Herta Müller wrote already in July, when she read her own acts, 914 pages that Germany was a pleasant reservation for spicly Securitate.
The touch, you can assume, will speculate and in some cases you may even know which name is hiding behind the covering name of Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, yet already very certain review of the Stazi components, the manipulation with the remainder of Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, the systematic lighting has been melted and restricted.
One of Birthler’s offices, which is responsible for the National Council for Securitate Processing (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act has since been quite long.
Only since 2005 there has been a law that regulates the management of components.
The fact that the former Securitate members still have a great influence in Romania, proved after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller one interview, in which one of the former Securitate chiefs from Temešvar expressed a rejection about the winner of the prize.
He has a psychosis and has only been interrogated once.
The abuse of power was expressed here completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in the context of the hidden guilt, inevitable questions are linked.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leads to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the confession of guilt and wrath.
To the genesis of the work of Herty Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note under the line.
The Champions League Deposit
It seemed like a purely dressed trade representative came from a sweet Christmas party on which the manufacturer of sports goods distributed sweets when a quarter hour after midnight the new coach of VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored sponsorship bag, arrived in the C-class mercedes.
A man with a markant pleasure was allowed to drive around him in a strange city.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk by luck was a 55-year-old man too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it will continue to work.
Or it just begins.
The words of only three days of engaged Switzerland: "While we have reached the eight-finals," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 victory over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we should not let ourselves glide by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the departure."
“More important task” is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mohucci the performance of the royal class even in the ordinary league day.
And to avoid re-evident weaknesses after three fast goals of Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11.).
Losing
The Champions League eight-finals (matches 16/17. + 23/24 February/ revenge matches 9/10 + 16/17. March) will be held on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the tremendous arrival of Babbel's successor will thus be preserved.
Not only in the presumed healer who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to engage and the joy of the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained the soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which but under the action of the therapist Babbel did not prove but no longer any effectiveness.
Babbel’s supporter Jens Lehmann admitted, “When a new impulse comes in football, things sometimes happen that you’t consider possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a many-week break caused by the injury, became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "fenomen" by the proverbic "fresh wind" and the work practices of the new boss: "It's a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
This was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, sports chairman Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stagnation.
Like Gross, players and managers don’t want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after a 0:4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that although one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We are not behind the water.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first domestic victory after three months was caused by weekend events that newly revived in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that act other than Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann's hard criticism.
He gave the board a weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of puberty fans.
Even the fact that his free day after the matches was cancelled, Lehmann described as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
Three-year-olds will not be happy with life anymore.
In any case, they are one with the others that without the work of a trained team, such a player-strong and fighting performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the igelit bag agrees.
World Championship in Heavy Weight
The passionate duel in Bern: The challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with the words and gestures of the world champion Vitalia Klička.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in heavy weight boxing organization WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Kličko remains the world champion in heavy weight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated on Saturday night in Bern American Kevin Johnson unanimously at points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
This is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
He has previously been the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t happen what everyone expected.
Kličko improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional matches, twice was defeated due to injuries.
Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th battle.
Before approximately 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2,02 meters high Kličko fought mainly with his left.
About eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who before the duel announced the end of the Kličkovy era, but dropped before the hits of the world champion, so Kličko could not set a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
Overall, the passive Johnson did little on the challengeers and just tried to get into the next rounds.
He provoked with words and gestures, but his hits hit the champion of the world rarely.
But it’s only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Kličk full of twelve rounds.
The contestant took care of the shock in the Swiss capital before the match.
He hit Klička as a "resistant zombies," who "not knows anything properly."
During the weighting on Friday, the champion made himself provoked, pulling Johnson's sun glasses out of his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after the return
He remained unbeatable after the fourth battle after his return on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of break, he then defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to submit without fighting.
This year he defeated the title of Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this battle I got only one blow and physically I am in good shape, justified Kličko quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF organizations.
But the WBA band is carried by British David Haye, after he dropped from the throne in November 2,13 meters high Nikolaev Vulaev.
Haye rejected the summer match against Kličko, which was planned for September.
His promoter company is allegedly planning a match against Klikk at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Case of Kunduz
Front attack from the opposition: The head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Defense Minister Guttenberg liars because of the wrong information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Linke (Levice) are calling on the Chancellor to submit an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings about the Kunduz attack, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed a conscious misconduct.
The minister on the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously false," said Green Group head Jürgen Trittin in Saturday's ARD news show "Tagesschau".
Let’s call it the usual phrase: false.
The murder order was issued in the event of non-compliance with the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only the destruction of the kidnapped trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. air strike, which was requested by the German commandant Kunduz Colonel Klein, according to NATO investigations, more than 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and Linke called on Saturday for the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Federal Assembly and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel has to explain whether the targeted murder strategy is part of the Afghan parliament’s policy – and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Bundeswehr and the Intelligence Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green’s colleagues Renate Künast asked.
Prime Minister Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific implementation of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also heavily doubts about the ministry’s trial on the background of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
It was officially stated that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and lock the ministers sensitive details.
However, from the surroundings of the two top officials it was that they alerted the Ministry of Defense even to several reports, including the two-page document of commander Colonel Klein and one report of the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had, in the meantime, to ask in a letter for clarification of the situation.
It is noted that he has not received any response yet.
The ministry did not comment on the outcomes on Saturday and pointed out that this will be addressed in the investigation committee of the Federal Assembly, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some people see in a awake state of images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only are psychically ill or drug addicts the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is okay.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark room, we can be surrounded by the wildest imaginations and fantasy prologies.
But whoever experiences in awakening a dream state, sees and hears things that others don’t see and hear, in today’s Western world is mostly for mad or drug addicted, or at least as strange.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in psychically ill or in drug addiction.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, take care of the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams changed state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in the better case we call them vision, in the worse errors.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlose Castaneda, the Shaman states of blurry, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Halucinations or sights arise when the balance of the neuronal transmitters of the brain - mainly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disrupted and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is interrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misunderstandings occur very often with schizophrene psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between illusion and dream was employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of a dream in a awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great similarity of foolishness with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all the foolishness, the foolishness, the foolishness of senses."
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and cryingly colorful.
The gravity above it has no power, it rises at the roof of the room.
He feels hanging.
Behind him winged devil characters with bloodshed red grimas, valuing teeth.
They hunt him, hunt into him with heavy, fireful shoes, throw with him around the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Noise, bad voices are threatened from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that offend and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from the stereo, puts them into a slide and fixs it on the hake on the roof.
He climbs on one speaker and puts the slide around his neck.
is jumping.
The smoke allows.
Learn, the church's voices scream throwing his bubbles, "Go to the clinic and let him be treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he experienced six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizopharmaceutical paranoic psychosis, in addition to this, he is maniodepressive, takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people suffer from schizophrenia at least once a lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
With acute schizophrene psychosis, the affected person can mostly no longer distinguish the internal and external world, they get into an overwhelming state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Specifically common is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or lead dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The affected person is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like a dream, the psychosis opens a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Doctor of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrene is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning aimed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot actively form them.
Thus, schizophrenians often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not mostly possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, Fuchss says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of the reality that a person perceives in psychosis remains essentially preserved."
False thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the experience is stolen in a real framework.
Scientists are still facing the puzzle why exactly our brain is doing such transmissions.
Exceptional conditions can lead to a short-term loss of relationship with reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development the neuronal maturity of the brain will be damaged, for example by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle about how the neuronal system will be disrupted, which has not been manifested for many years.
The roles also play the influences of the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposal to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain turns
Crazy is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they sweat expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
If we perceive transgressions as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and translations for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The irreale world in our head).
Halucinations belong to typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also to surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as border personality or depression also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, it hallucinates under certain conditions the brain itself of a healthy person.
Halucinations, according to Kastena, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which the sensory perception is processed are too active or less suppressed; when our brain is swallowed, or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also removing stimuli, stress, anxiety with love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents said they experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, he lives in a small town in Meklenburg-East Morocco and goes to the high school there.
In fact, a normal girl.
If there were no pictures and voices.
On the break, it can happen that a column with long, dark hair will reach her.
When he responds, the colleagues look at her with surprise - no one except her sees and hears this boy.
This unwilling girl is considered to be a famous dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t sleep, she knows it.
He is awake, he hears and sees that boy, just as he hears and sees a girl sitting next to each other in the bar.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It’s a pleasant feeling, I like that guy.
I’m crazy, I’m sometimes asking.
But he knows that this boy and other tricks are not real and again disappears.
In the night, the phenomena are rather crazy.
It is often a burden.
When she sits in the class, she can’t watch the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new fellow student, but he explains to everyone else hearing and visible on the table of the mathematical equation.
In the night, the phenomena are rather crazy.
When she is waiting in her dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, she can’t often distinguish whether she’s up or if she’s already asleep, whether the images she sees, grimasy, or a girl with bleeding cut wounds on her hands and legs arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, screaming to those characters.
She doesn’t tell her parents and friends about it, they would think she’s crazy.
This year, Sarah K. is 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist Kastena on the internet, she knows exactly that she didn’t get crazy.
It is also an art of desperation.
If someone is socially isolated or the stimuli are taken away from him, he will likely have a hallucination, says Kasten.
I think the brain then doesn’t have enough job and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., a single child, was as a little girl afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when at the age of 13, she learned that the man she called a father since she thought herself was not her own father.
Because with visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same areas of the brain are active, which also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for the affected people like Sarah K. to distinguish fraud and reality from each other.
Halucinations are also images that allow the brain to form, so they act so real.”
Also night dreams evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Halucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally distinguished from halucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenia, psychically healthy people are able to identify their errors as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The border between dream and hallucination
In our world concentrated too much on consciousness, unfortunately, imaginary experience is mostly patologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor at Heidelberg and Head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, suffering illness, but it also brings positive, creativity - the translation is also the art of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of changing consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid conditions are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers real and cannot even differentiate them backward from the alert state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation, who experience with full consciousness motor damage.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for instance, by a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
The line between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to manage any situation, the worlds will change, but the real situation will be present in imagination.
The intense form of the support of senses and the transition of senses into some unbearable situation, which allows us to form our own ability, to pass within a moment into loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories.
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a salvation action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after a cardiac cartilage surgery with a subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness went on a several-day journey, with his body loading unmovely on the intensive care unit.
Claussen was immersed in the world he created, visited strange times and places: He becomes an old man attached to the bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot keeps his health.
It lives in the early Middle Ages among the noble, which produces drug substances from the blood.
On a motorcycle, he is kidnapped by a Greek to his hometown, on a hospital bed he surfs on an Alps fiard and encounters a Korean mafia.
It is completely immersed in imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner roads are fundamentally different for Claussena from any dream.
The dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental paths are clearly clear after years and in unimportant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid conditions, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in a vigilant state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to deformation of what we call reality.”
A fact that can also be enriching.
Snow can come.
Burda
At the age of 27 children will take over the publishing office.
The new chief publisher Kallen is a transitional solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to pass his business into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will be 100% owned by the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business long in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man to SPIEGEL.
We carefully dealt with the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only then.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put their children at the forefront of 7500 employees unless they are sufficiently capable.
This would kill both children and the business.
Burda on Thursday announced that he would withdraw from the Board of Directors since January, and appointed his successor Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
He was first responsible for technology.
Later, the Section of the Cash added responsibility for the company’s assets and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer also Direct Marketing, Foreign, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are headed by the publisher.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to “pass 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
The holding company is expected to be 100% owned by the family in the future, Burda says.
Having regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family have no certainty before disappearance: “It always touched companies that were infected by the desire for capital, who were speculating and thought they could become great players.
This was never my strategy.
He’s never had a dream of a world power,” Burda says.
I don’t perceive myself as the political preceptor of this country as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play the world league with “Time”, these shops are too big.

Escotes Variados
Christmas is coming, and this is the time when it is appropriate to find out what celebrity wears, and adapt to this even your ceremonial closet.
The shape of the cut is very important to emphasize the character, which is necessary to keep in mind.
We present a number of proposals.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
Energy company Endesa, together with the municipality of Barcelona, founded 'Office LIVE'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE’ (Logistics for the Implementation of Electric Vehicles) office shall establish and govern a travel plan for the Implementation of Electric Vehicles in the City and shall ensure mobility agreements, shall handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVELE, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
In general, the objective is to promote this transportation means of the future.
3 Electrical Cities
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will join the project as well.
These are three cities that the government has chosen within the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Region of Catalonia.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa’s participation in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts 'peace period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "peace period".
In the 2009 Economic Report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summarized the measures that were introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competition Plan for the automotive industry, we would have a state of abandonment, the closure of some of our major manufacturing enterprises today," the Prime Minister said.
“Through this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace is expected for this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competition plan, which is part of the Integrated Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiary companies that mobilized investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures on the support requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with autonomous areas and automotive brands.
According to the President’s statements, this plan allowed to reduce the average emissions rate of 6% for new vehicles sold in the Spanish market, and secured a “significant increase” in records, namely in November by “40%”.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classical Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, a place for meetings of professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Madrid Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, which will represent more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid also will be products of all kind related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, genuine flavours for collectors and curious.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renovation; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Examination of External Qualification
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be supplemented by parallel activities: conducting concentrations, sports performances, exam qualifications, presentations and competitions.
Competence tests will also be carried out for classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: the preservation of sports style
Mazda intends to show that environmentally friendly does not have any negative impact on sporting style.
And this is why Mazda3 also has a built-in motor stop and start system - also baptized as-Stop-, which is a device that is currently available only with a 2.0 150 hp gasoline engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface processing, vehicle performance, population, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent in Mazda3.
The front seats including the driver's seats have excellent ergonomics and are greatly fixed.
The driver is also extremely gentle.
Using the tool and console set we come to the conclusion that Mazda continues to develop the Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a remarkable red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both the Japanese, are in contrast with the sharpness of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who desire a very comfortable drive.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage space and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and engine start system is currently available only with a two-litre gasoline engine and a 150 horse-power asest-step manual transmitter.
This engine is a genuine flavor. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who don’t drive so many kilometers a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine because it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a greater number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention primarily the trail trail monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the formation of the dead angle, control of the drag and stability, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor,bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with a Pack Premium, for an additional fee of € 1,500: adaptable twoxenon lights and the BOSE audio system with a CD holder, in addition to other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
In addition, people who don’t drive more kilometers a year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a 2.0 and 150 hp benzin engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21.770 euros for the Luxury and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury ‘Premier’
L.A. has a red carpet, gentle like the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars glowed more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, has chosen the dark 'ladies'.
Promise of Fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, it only serves to browse the mail, without the possibility of browsing a certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine awarded him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it out is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid for, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay for Peek a six-fold amount.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is approximately 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe.
People traveling with the smartphone already know what it means to lose the data service after crossing the boundaries or intolerably search for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) so that they can check the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a PhD in Physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly calling for a reduction in roaming rates so that they are accessible throughout Europe, which still has no desired effect.
There is reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it’s interesting that it still has the name Fon when it doesn’t have WiFi) will reach this type of tariff means that operators begin to think differently and consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and more searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is paid when purchased, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it’s a possibility of purchasing with a permanent access as that Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I look at the post on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the consumer’s point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The Colour That Michelle Loves
Yellow is the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama to take office as President of the United States, she chose the dress and jacket in this color, the same color she also chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to the fact that it is a similar color - yellow-green with brilliant effects-, in both cases it was a three-part set - a dress, a bag and a jacket of the same material- decorated with a large height or a lem.
At first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The material from which the clothes are made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of his entry into the position, Michelle used a big stick, in Oslo samet with a print.
It also changes the accessories: green shoes with a medium high patch, now-like model, but in gold color.
They also wear different hairstyles: this timedrdol, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternity-related work problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger-year-old women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and the Occupational Career of Spanish Women' conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study included 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to maternity.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of a partnership there are many differences in views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, begin to live with a partner earlier, first give birth to the first child and overall have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partner life and maternity are delayed, and have fewer descendants.
“Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have the first child in an average of 3.7 years from the beginning of coexistence with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women whose achievement of their stable employment spent most of their lives and therefore had to postpone the coexistence and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on maternity, although less influence on the start time of co-life with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is dedicated to research at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of the descendants is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the degree of education, the higher the age for women to marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49 years, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 or 32.1.
“There is another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to their first child even before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education progress the opposite prefer to get a stable job, before marriage and the birth of their first child,” Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress becomes the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'For I stand for it'.
Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses at the international level, adds itself to other famous L'Oréal Paris figures such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before she entered this selected club actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Chatrandom').
The male part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelinin's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Prices
British people have a lot to talk about fashion.
Their most important representatives – designers and models, both earlier and present – gathered at the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court and Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model of the year.
Poker by Manuel Vicenta
Manuel Vicent donates in 'Easy Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration Fernando Vicente) thirty X-ray images of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases even in the ordinary life).
They do not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but they are looking for something similar to the core of creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent does not save relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader enjoyment, even when repeated reading.
Here I give some observations.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: a pleasure of opposition, a morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The nihilistic, allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not the intellect, something between impotence and ignorance, with blind poetical humor, without sense, as if it was a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been overwhelmed by the passion for this woman for thirteen years,cycology, pleasure and regret, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of wrath."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was released in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight thousand heights in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best mountains often fall."
About William Faulkner: “He was a strange man.
About himself, he said of himself that he was the heir of the countryside, and sometimes again that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer has captured on the bridge the melted scream of this man from Munich to bring his sound to the night of the twentieth century in his literary form, escaping himself before himself and calling to the future and sharply speaking to the worms."
Dorothy Parker said, “One day she slept and prayed, ‘God my beloved, order me to stop writing as a woman.’”
Joseph Conrad says: "On his tomb, Spenser's verses were drawn up: 'After effort comes a dream, after a storm a quiet port, after a war of rest, after a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In his luggage he also took his depression.
The husband entirely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azalks or that the birds sang Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.”
About Pío Baroja: "What else went to Martin Santos than to focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else went to Benet than to let Baroy execute Faulkner's weapon?
What else went to the whole than to make himself glorious at the expense of the glory of that man?”
Angry Aggression
Last week my seventy-year-old mother passed through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed through the circle and our dog, a crossroads saved from a shelter weighing up to six kilograms, without a word he was twice caught and seriously injured.
Our anger is so bigger that we don’t see anything fun in such an aggression toward a small and defensive animal that was in addition on the guide.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met with these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil obsessed man who attacks the animal is able to do the same to the woman, to the child, to the old man or to anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, in a typically quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the nearest commission, but we doubt that it was something, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we find that these crazy murders were of Spanish nationality.
The anger forced us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s happening to today’s youth when they’re entertaining by troubling the defensive animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don’t understand where the right education and respect for animals and humans have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for helmet use
Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, mainly for younger drivers, as both entities today.
The aim of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only means that can be prevented by headaches or deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign is part of its commitments to road safety, which “makes more than design and manufacture even safer products,” and confirmed that it is trying to fulfill this purpose in other ways, i.e. through an instruction and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet while driving on a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 repaid motorcycles will be placed in the roofs to get to the awareness of the wider public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety is "a permanent problem" of this company, which is the manufacturer of two-wheeled vehicles with the main objective of continuously improving the safety of the products.
The sales of light vehicles are increasing.
After almost two years, the market of light commercial vehicles begins to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain meant an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures of the patronate organization of manufacturers Anfac and dealer Ganvam.
However, the favorable figure is better to put in the quarantine, since November 2008 is a significantly bad period for comparison and meant a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month,the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: personal car derivatives, pick-ups, supplies, smaller trucks and light trucks/subtrains.
And the clouds that most damage demand have not disappeared, even though they were purchased by private individuals, the majority of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized enterprises, and in 100% of the cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors should be added to the limitations resulting from the closure of the bank loans sources, such as the stop of activity or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of 2000E has not helped much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to purchase a light utility car within 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvamu again reminded that it is necessary to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trams and buses).
The Seller’s Association predicts that in 2010 the development will be the same as last year and according to calculations sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The help system at the manual brake is already an obligatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking system it will also be with the stability control of the ESP,with the help of manual brake systems, all this will become the mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others a deadline for the removal of the defect is set, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU are aimed at increasing the protection of pedestrians, while functioning in a way that can help prevent numerous crashes.
The hand brake assistant system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system discovers after the driver slopes.
But it is not always able to keep this pressure up to the end.
According to a study conducted by Bosch, one-third of the drivers who suffered an accident did not stick the brake before the collision and half of them did not fully use the brake power.
1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the brake system, shortening the brake distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related deaths per year could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more markant – according to calculations it would prevent one of four accidents with impact on people – after the introduction of so-called intelligent hands-on brake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (with the help of a radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even when the collision cannot be prevented, the device will impact the brake as intensively as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors delays plans for Opel to January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, the employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of the month of April – probably April 8 – as informed by Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer warns that it will take more time to meet the renewal plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, strives to make every point of the plan first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the countries in which the production plants are established, will be issued with delay in early 2010.
GM, on the contrary, assures that the Saab sale decision should be made in these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the support of the Russian Converg group.
If it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of the Saab assets to the Chinese company Baic.
Saab will continue to be closed by the end of the year if it fails to sell it.
Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis was, first of all, the automatic loading roof is in placed with manual control, thus the weight was reduced by 21 kg; further aluminum doors such as GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; air conditioning removal, 13; reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to the weight reduction by another 7 kg; after the installation of sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to the relieved 19 inch wheels further five kg.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six pounds less and replacing the door shots with textile shots means another pounds.
Also offered with the PDK two-connector transmitter, one vehicle with a hand-arranged six-step speed box has been tested, mainly on high-end roads in California, on mountainous sections with many twisted currents.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to the asphalt.
Moreover, on the contrary: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model that would at the same time carry such safety when moving in the turn, even at high speeds.
It’s a small athlete capable of heating the muscles during a short drive for the necessary time until we order him sprint, braking, and regaining the use of the engine.
Thanks to the driving, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the wheel, it is what the car will do.
And it will do it with surgical accuracy.
Sound of the engine by will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and it is possible to strengthen it with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in Panamera.
The capacity of acceleration is brutal, whether it is during sailing or recovery.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads through which we pass with Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the drive; and at the same time, in some currents we met in the morning on the moisture and shrink even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra light car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is a little more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be launched in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
The girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series and occasional 'starlette' at the 'firmy' shows, the singer shows her face to a bad girl so vehemently as her Chanel pockets.
More than ‘Bad Girl’ or ‘It Girl’, it’s ‘Bag Girl’.
Baskonia has won in Israel
Working Treasury gained a brilliant victory in 82-91 during her hosting on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus came to the head of her group after the great performance of Mirzy Teletovice, who with eight three points was the declaration of the best in the team (29 reviews).
The Vitory team was able to replace the significant absence of Hermann, Oleson, Huertas or Mic with a great dose of engagement and collective work, although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy from the round with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started in front of the blue, who stood on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitorias were from a distance, already suggested that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alav team decided for the internal game of Baraca and the work of Eliyah, which was accepted by the swim and praise when he returned to his original place of work to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to show as the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' at Splitter's rating has already suggested that it will not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided even in the smallest and the Macabee wanted to remind Vitorias that not everyone wins on their field, and 'with the hand of Elíase' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the 'yellow' return to the sunlight (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured, but not dead at all, needed a few accurate games to take a breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic rifle appeared, which with three triumphs almost in a row and with the help of Englishe and Ribas returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which they achieved at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs scratched their skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to prepare them for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter excluded for the faul Ivanovic didn’t rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match had already the winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injury makes Unicaja impossible to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left him the leadership of group B in the Euroleague in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team did not lock the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or rival, one of the most sick in Europe, and with a big budget.
The aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, raised the field with 12-18, the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity ofUnicaja , although the local arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcice and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, the 13th minute, which was the moment when the battle between the USABeverley and Williams supports meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to work and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal errors of Carlose Jiménez charged the Unicaja team.
Between the internal players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, the 19th minute.
Impossible Revenge
The third part was very aggressive by Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, demonstrated superiority and even managed to balance the difference from the match in Malaza Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shocked the leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who wounded himself in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the leadership and the three-point points Cook and Lewise's contribution left a certain hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because Olympiacos, thanks to its strengthening and superiority in centimeters in its zone, proved it is unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to match the basket average 81-62, 37 minutes, and Unicaja swallowed and passed the lead to Olympiacos.

Brazil sets date for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelayi to stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The resigned president must leave his diplomatic mission not later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduras capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he's hidden from September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27 after the end of his term he must leave and seek another shelter."
The station also quoted a former citizen who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the fixed deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the election of November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get asylum in Brazil.
The operation eventually broke down because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which he tried to impose by the "de facto" government presided by Roberto Micheletti.

After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when the inflation of assets represented the dominant mood on the markets, uncertainty has again appeared on the markets, which shouldn’t be surprising because it’s already a natural state in a environment where negotiators make decisions about a future that is uncertainty in itself.
The drug used by the central banks for the stabilization of the market was the funding of debt by direct acquisition of assets and indirect release of liquidity at a rate close to zero so that the financial institutions could buy assets to be discounted.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost over, and without questioning their discorded liquidity policy, they begin to throw a little sand into the private, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the capacity of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we participate in the return reduction of risk revenues.
The movability of the stock exchange and the differences in bond companies have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again touched public debt.
The pressure on quality is back and the U.S., Japan and Germany have become the shelter selected by investors, thus expanding the differentiation of the eurozone countries against Germany.
Spain was almost not affected by this instability, but at that time the Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new review of the Spanish Kingdom's qualification decrease.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for the silence of the moral risk supporters who have again tried to burden the conscience of the people responsible for the world economic policy for the removal of the destructive consequences of employment loan restrictions, when in fact it would be necessary to proclaim a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, the situation in Dubai represents the tribal struggle between the Emirates for the restoration of power in the Emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen it before.
The government that covers the deficit, the elections and the new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It makes no sense that Ecofin should save Hungary from non-fulfillment of foreign payments at the beginning of the year and allow the euro member country to fail to fulfill its obligations.
But the logic is that Ecofin is to force the Greek government to transparency and commit its citizens to common responsibility in the need of emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalization premium from transitional risk, after some excesses on supported positions would be within the expectation.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we don’t have to worry.
If the European differences are reduced and our differences are further expanded, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
When our leading indicators force most study services to predict their renewal scenarios and review their 2011 rise scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, for the Spanish economy it does not have a great hope to survive the fulfillment of this warning.
Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment “be careful, friends drivers.”

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the House of Representatives, where he is discussing the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Galán provided the press several comments on the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 million by 2020 and another €60,000 million from this date by 2030, if the current nuclear power plants areined.
If this does not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola actually believes that in the next decade, investments should be focused not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020, the issue will change and the performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal power plants with mechanisms of carbon dioxide capture and above all on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who believes that the law on a sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government, corresponds to the line that the company demanded, did not want to leave the vein as a royal decree to promote the national coal consumption, which is contrary to the policy of fighting climate change.
According to him, it is a "clear long-term bet"in this sense, despite the "precision" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made now, because their maturity takes time and a stable tax framework is needed for their launch.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
The Ferrovial subsidiary for airport land service,Swiss Swissport, will play the role of the preferential partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cost service at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which the economic deadlines have not yet expired, is in force for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation on the creation of a Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation.
The association predicts an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is struggling for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where it already works as an energy and water management enterprise.
The building is a tunnel estimated at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5 kilometers long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the nearest option for seAcciona to settle in this country as a construction and concession highway enterprise.
Municipality wants to have the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initial in English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the customs.
The proposals are expected to be submitted in May, with an estimated investment of 1.700 million Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the last stage competing three companies with significant presence in European buildings.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second with headquarters in Italy is one of the largest European underground construction specialists.
Northern Direct is in the game against the Acciona group with the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Infrastructure Manager Transfield and the French Construction Group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which passed through the network, is called LBRJV and participates in it by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a significant company specializing in civil construction Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction and privatization, but it brings with it a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy, followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS gained a market position through its 30% share in Hochtief, the owner of the cited Leighton company.
Millions of assets
Acciona plays on a geographical area of great importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activity and in the dissolving trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of that build and manage dissolving facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
It is now planned to consolidate these two areas and to use the joint energy for access to the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The subterranean road subject to the customs, promotered by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, called the Northern Link (Northern Link), is intended to connect the western highway from Toowong with the circular route in Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of 5 kilometers of the tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce the traffic overload of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled to be assigned for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would be opened in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the works is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two streams in each direction, an electronic tax system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane has already offered this contract by Hochtief
Australia still brings Hochtief significant profits, since yesterday it announced a contract with the government estimated to be 154 million.
ACS will operate through its local Leighton subsidiary the national broadband network with optical fiber cable.
This situation will allow fast access to the internet to 400,000 people and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the construction project of the King George Tower of 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was just to start and Hochtief closed sales for 129 million.
In the UK, namely in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centers for 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC has awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, received a €64,5 million allocation for the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for the highway in Slovenia.
The company received a contract a few days after the work was carried out to expand the tunnel in Borussia (Austria) for 130 million dollars.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The opening of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mr. Rushmore gets an advertisement in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for Mr. Rushmore for approximately three million euros a year over the past two years, the railway company.
Mr. Rushmore was chosen among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the contest written by Renfe, of which four went to the final, including TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising over the last three years.
From this point on, Mr. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaigns.
63 million proFrance Télécom fines for breaking the competition
The competition regulatory authority in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Télécom for anti-competitive behavior in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the edge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still the state company have purchased more than 560 million euros of fines since 1994 for placing obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition supervisory authority believes France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past, and therefore there has been a recurrence.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened the app store on the internet in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice broadcasts.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will need to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought from the beginning 476.4 million to Madrid and Barca
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its establishment in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned since then 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth most winning club in the competition.
The charter is governed by Manchester United.
The charter is governed by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory. it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed 5.362,5 million euros between 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in this event since the start of the tournament in the 1992/1993, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money he earned for participation, and the only together with AC Milan who won three times the main prize.
The current Catalan champion and the last winner of the disappeared European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich’s Bayern, two teams that have also charged the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
He lost both with Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to earn the most money through the Champions, although it has earned the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process for the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the authority, which is chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of these funds, UEFA has spent 413,1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the preliminary ranking round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who reached the participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to an additional €550,000 for each match they participate.
There are also prizes for winning (800,000 euros) and for remission (400,000 for each team). Eight finalists receive three million each; eight quarterfinals3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive 4 million.
The champion earned 9 million, while the second finalist 5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments, the club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning in the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments, for which 337.8 million are intended.
The money is divided according to the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
The champion of last year will receive 40% of allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for €29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group today published the details of the offer to purchase shares, with the help of which it wants to get the top place between 25% to 29.9% of the Sos capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this delay 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa offers the company 18% below its market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for the shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it was not informed about the offer, although the company Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the soil continues to change the structure of its leadership.
As an attempt to remain on the edge of possible offers for the purchase and compensation of the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as the head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high position in the food industry.
It is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the chairman of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company is continuing to be immersed in the legal struggle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the companies of the brothers Salazar.
In fact, it is not possible to discard the possibility that in the coming months the S.S. will reveal new transfers of funds.
As for the credit of the Salazar, former council members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) told the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million, without knowing the place of their destination.
CNMV allows the option to exclude Paternina that participated Inversor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved the exclusion of Inversor Mer against Federica Paternin on October 9.
The supervisory authority has explained that it authorizes this operation, since it understands that its conditions meet the applicable standards, and considers that it is "sufficient" to explain the brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December.
The CNMV explained that the offer is aimed at obtaining 550.008 shares of Federica Paternina at the price of €7.65 per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which is made up of 6.142.786 shares accepted to trade on the exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, he explained that 5,592,778 million shares were unmounted, which will not be able to be transferred in any way until an offer was concluded, which specified that the price was determined by Federico Paternina according to the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Automotive Assessment Tools
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car services make money.
Each day, thousands of cars that suffered an insurance event are pulled to the service, where the expert has to estimate the damage and the costs of repair.
No insurance event is the same, and the calculation of parts and workforce time costs can be long and complex work.
To calculate manually the cost of repair from €20,000 to €30,000 including parts and workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions to estimate insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information that the manufacturers provide them to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera is the leading company; 80% of the reviews are made with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of industry valuation and information elaboration tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázqueze, Audatex trading director, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
Additionally, the number of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and motor solutions have been introduced over the past five years than in the previous fifteen years.
Once the new vehicle comes into the market, these companies begin to work.
This is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and to determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "pick" the individual parts of tourist wagons.
As for a model with mass sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not for example Ferrari or Lamborghini.
As for the road park in circulation they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information allows to use and provide different products.
The most common use focuses on repairs and maintenance, but according to each country there are also tools for the management of spare parts or for the calculation of the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide available to inform the value of the used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex is not offered in our country, but in the United States yes.
Given the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get support that professionals in the sector can benefit.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, a standard insurance event award solution designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or the paint machine.
This tool is applied according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is €5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only on the basis of the first number of the submarine.
AudaGlass focuses on the glass of vehicles and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to remove vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for the identification of the trend, the conduct of geodemographic analyses or the detection of deviations by brands or models.
For instance, it is possible to study how many models determined brands have passed the service due to an accident or how many serious insurance events have suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for experts and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a service provider for damages, accidents or car maintenance assessment and resolution.
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historic product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 it was charged by €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of office installations in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of her brother is founded in Europe and 38% in North and South America. she works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoices of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera Group stood at the exchange $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007 it has been quoted at the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for car and motorcycle or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation predicted the deposit of EUR 59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year by the remaining 15%.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to the huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sales service is exclusively responsible for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts,leasing, service, spare parts sale and professional sellers who have to register before the start of operations.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets stand Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, the car whose car number has been removed cannot return to operation, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historic value may be allowed to operate, although they have been dismissed, after a preliminary procedure.
Service Budget in Four Steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user will get the budget in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating a budget agenerating the budget.
The ease of use is a critical condition for these systems, especially for the belief of older professionals who are more or less resilient to the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
Of course, it is necessary to use a computer with an internet connection.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the car number, a real graphic display of the model will appear and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include the variable as the price of workforce, add-ons or discounts, and then print and transfer to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include an estimate of workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can fund.
Currently, Audatex is working on making this display three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanists welcome, because it will allow you, for example, to select the door and turn it to display the inner side.
